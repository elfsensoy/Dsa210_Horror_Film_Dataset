348,Patrick E. Abe,"Described by Roger Ebert as a ""trapped in a haunted house"" movie, this movie set the bar for Horror in the Summer. 

The ""Nostromo,"" like ""Star Wars"" spacecraft, looks worn and in use, compared to the ""just out of the box"" look of ""Star Trek"" spacecraft. (And I'm a fan of the ""Star Trek"" universe!) The claustrophobic feel of the ""Nostromo"" is due to ""filming inside of a tube"" location shooting next seen in ""Das Boot."" 

A band of ""space truckers"" are awakened from hibernation, and are shocked to find that they are only half way home. The Company orders them to investigate an Alien transmission, which sets up a descent into Hell as the crew finds themselves being stalked by an opportunistic ""Exomorph."" As the crew is picked off one by one, the true nature of the beast and the odd attitude of the Science officer, Ash, raise the anxiety level over 100%.

What sets this tale apart from other ""space monster"" films is the character of Third officer Ripley, who raises uncomfortable questions to Capt. Dallas about company policy in general and Science officer Ash in particular. After Capt. Dallas disappears, take-charge-female-Ripley discovers Ash's true intentions and leads her diminished crew to action.

 The level of violence has been described as ""near pornographic,"" which is helped along by H.R. Giger's ""worst nightmare"" mature Alien. This is the first of a memorable franchise, featuring a strong female leader that continues into the ""Prometheus"" prequel.(?)",2016-09-21T08:25:53.208Z,8.0,Alien,1979
348,John Chard,"There is a clause in the contract which specifically states any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin must be investigated... 

Alien is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon. It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.

The space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...

Back on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a  terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.

On plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.

Some still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid  conventions.

With art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.

It made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.

Now 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly show. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10",2019-05-12T22:00:41.553Z,10.0,Alien,1979

348,r96sk,"<em>'Alien'</em> isn't as eventful, and as such as entertaining, as I had anticipated, though it is still an enjoyable near two hours.

It's a strong cast, with newbie Sigourney Weaver putting in a great performance. Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and John Hurt are good too. I wanted to see more of them, though that's normal given the tightness of the setting - there's only so much they can do, of course.

Other positives include the neat set design, solid special effects and well done tension building. I can't say I was ever fully unnerved, in fairness that's more a personal thing as fiction rarely scares me, but I was locked on for the entirety. It also gets respect for setting the benchmark it did.

348,GenerationofSwine,"Horror in Space, that's what this is. It's a space monster movie, and the thing is, if you see Aliens, or most of the other Alien related films BEFORE you see this one, you're going to be expecting something completely different.

But what you have is a horror movie set on a space ship with an atmosphere so thick that you could cut it with a knife.

You can taste the eerie tension when you watch it...and, at least in my eyes, that makes it better than the over-the-top Space Marines that you see in the later installments.

And, no questions are answered. There is no broad sweeping mythology. There is only the movie, there is only the monster, there is only the fear and tension. But that is all the movie needs.

It's just science-fiction and scary. It's a brilliant merger.

But, don't listen to the people making it out to be more than it is. It's really ONLY a horror movie in space and nothing more. That doesn't make it any less enjoyable, but it does make it completely confusing when you read reviews that make it out to be more than an exceptional monster movie.",2023-01-13T23:03:48.663Z,10.0,Alien,1979
348,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**One of the great founders of modern sci-fi.**

Anyone who knows me already knows that I don't really like alien-themed movies, because I don't strictly believe in intelligent life outside our planet. However, the theme has already yielded many quality horror or thriller films. “Alien” is arguably the best, best-performed, and most enshrined and culturally significant of them all. It's one of those films that has already gone beyond cinematic issues to become a piece of art and culture that we all know, even people who never took the time to see it.

Thus, it is not worth wasting time explaining the plot around the “Nostromo”, a cargo ship with seven crew members who are decimated by a highly dangerous and carnivorous alien. The direction, in charge of Ridley Scott, is excellent, meticulous, attentive, and the story is intelligent, very well written and with well-developed and used characters. Contrary to what happens in other films, we see the characters trying to act as a team, and trying to solve an unexpected and dangerous situation. I never felt like they were acting in such a way as to almost purposefully put themselves in danger, which happens a lot in recent horror movies.

Sigourney Weaver made an excellent dramatic career after this film, which established her as an actress and opened doors for her in the industry. A deserved reward, given that she puts in her best efforts and gives this character all the resilience, humanity and charisma she deserves and needs. Despite the general quality of the cast being quite good, there are almost no actors capable of matching Weaver. As far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film has excellent cinematography (it even looks newer than it is) and really good special effects and visuals, considering that there is no CGI and that everything is done in the old-fashioned way. Finally, a word of praise for the iconic original score composed by Jerry Goldsmith.",2023-04-21T01:46:44.676Z,9.0,Alien,1979

Sigourney Weaver is superb as the feisty, no-nonsense ""Ripley"" who leads the defence against a beastie that has brute strength, determination, intelligence and an astonishing ability to move at speed through the corridors and conduits of the ship. Ridley Scott allows the tension to rise gently and violently, by degree, and the clever use of sound and light; Jerry Goldsmith's tense score and excellent supporting performances from Tom Skerritt and a wonderfully seedy ian Holm make this a seminal sci-fi horror film that still makes you want to hide behind the sofa - 40 years on!",2023-06-05T19:27:33.817Z,7.0,Alien,1979

A Phoenix secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), embezzles $40,000 and rashly flees town, ending up at a remote motel in Fairvale, California, where she encounters the eccentric Mama’s boy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Mixed into this web is a private investigator (Martin Balsam), Marion’s sister (Vera Miles) and Marion’s secret beau (John Gavin).

Directed by Alfred Hitchcock based on Robert Bloch’s book, “Psycho” made a huge impact when it was released in 1960. It contains a plot development that was groundbreaking at the time shared by England’s “City of the Dead” (aka “Horror Hotel”), which went into production six weeks earlier than “Psycho” and was released in the UK at the same time, but not in America until 2 years later. While they’re both good, “Psycho” is way superior. It was followed by three sequels (1983, 1986 and 1990), the last being a semi-prequel, all starring Anthony Perkins as Norman with Vera Miles returning for the first one.

One thing I don’t like is that it was shot in B&W. Check out the sequels and the 1998 remake to observe the same settings in living color.

The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes and was shot primarily at the backlot of Universal Studios, Universal City, California, with other parts in Los Angeles & Gorman, California, and Phoenix, Arizona.

539,CinemaSerf,"There is so much more to this film than just that famous scene in the shower - and so much of it belongs to the marvellous scoring of Bernard Herrmann. His ability to use those screeching strings, and the pace of his music does so much of the heavy lifting that gives this film a sense of accumulating menace that makes it still, after over 60 years, a masterful piece of cinema. Janet Leigh wants to make a go of things with her cash-strapped hunky boyfriend ""Sam"" (John Gavin) so when an unexpected opportunity arises at work that puts $40,000 in her lap, she skips town and takes refuge during a thunderstorm at the ""Bates"" motel where she encounters ""Norman"" (a very handsome looking Anthony Perkins). The rest you will just have to watch for yourself, but the story has just about everything you could want from a thriller: a fella with a bit of a ""mummy"" syndrome; some good old fashioned larceny; lust and though I didn't quite love the ending, it is a superbly dramatic piece of well considered and constructed cinema that cleverly builds on what is quite a simple story with a strong and convincing cast.

Stellar cast, with Perkins giving a eerie Oscar worthy performance. Cinematography and the soundtrack are amazing. The iconic shower scene is just as effective today as it was 65 years ago. If I was going to make a criticism it would be the scene at the end where the audience sees everything for what it is.

694,John Chard,"This rum is red, man!

In spite of author Stephen King not being happy with Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of his novel, The Shining (1980) has proved to be a critical and commercial darling.

It may not be in the spirit that King wanted, but it's undeniably a skillful piece of film making, a mixture of beauty and terror, of bravura techniques and simple but effective scares. With quality acting performances to match as well. The story unfolds at a deliberately slow pace, claustrophobia oozes from practically every frame, while the narrative smarts brings to bear the ghosts of the human and supernatural kind, all bone chillingly rendered for great effect by the vast spaces - the cold winter grounds outside - of the Overlook Hotel.

It's not all perfect, the screenplay is very average, which makes Kubrick's work even more impressive, but with that comes the wave of feeling about style over substance. A churlish gripe? Maybe? But with Jack Nicholson on scenery chewing overdrive and Kubrick pulling the strings, The Shining still represents a highlight in horror. A horror movie that all horror fans should see at least once - and in the best format available as well! 8/10",2015-11-01T00:53:21.432Z,8.0,The Shining,1980

694,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

With Doctor Sleep, an almost 40-year sequel to The Shining, being released this week, now it’s the perfect time to revisit one of the greatest horror movies of all-time, as well as one of the most influential directors ever, Stanley Kubrick. I know, I know… Spoiler-free? For a movie released in 1980? Well, first of all, there’s always someone who still didn’t watch it. Secondly, as deeper we get into the 21st century, the more the 60s/70s/80s/90s movies are forgotten. And finally, if there’s a movie which I don’t need spoilers to explain how outstanding it is, it’s The Shining. With that said …

It has always been one of my favorite horror films ever. It’s not perfect (no film is) and some aspects don’t work as well now as they did 5/10/20 years ago. When it came out, Kubrick’s adaptation of Stephen King’s novel was received with mixed reactions. King himself criticized the movie. However, less than 10 years later, Kubrick’s film was already being reevaluated. Nowadays, it’s considered a cult classic, and it’s easy to understand why. From the countless homages to the hundreds of comedic parodies, The Shining has some of the most memorable lines ever. Just this year, we had It: Chapter Two mimicking Jack Nicholson’s “Here’s Johnny!” scene, for example. And then there’s the mysterious “redrum”…

However, the movie’s biggest influence is its technical achievements. I apologize in advance if this review becomes too technical, but it’s impossible not to address the arguably best component of the film. This movie was one of the first to use Steadicam (a camera stabilizer mount which allows for smooth shots, even on irregular surfaces, isolating the operator’s movement), something that became so common that people don’t even praise anymore. Honestly, there are still a bunch of recent movies that have terrible camera work, so I’m one of those who defend that the Steadicam use shouldn’t be taken for granted. Especially how Kubrick did, barely above the floor, which originated the extension “low-mode” that now exists and allows for the operator to easily shoot lower than its waist.

With the innovative use of the technical equipment, Kubrick’s delivers a masterclass in framing (composing the visual content of a series of frames as seen from a point of view). So much that it became worthy of studying. Almost every shot in this movie has a visual clue or an underlying theme. If you ever feel bored during your viewing, then you’re (probably) not “watching it right”. You’re not truly thinking about it or looking around the characters. This isn’t a generic horror flick with monsters or demons jump scaring you. It’s heavy on visual storytelling, so if you don’t pay attention, you’re going to reach the film’s climactic and enigmatic ending and feel that you missed something.

From the mise-en-scene (arrangement of everything that appears in the framing, hence this French term that means “placing on stage“) having several blood-red colors to the wide shots clearly showing “exit” signs and giving the maze-vibe of the enormous hotel, the imminent danger is visually spread out across the movie. The symmetry/mirroring is absolutely crucial to not only deliver key plot points but to create this sense of reality vs fantasy. From the hotel’s structure and decoration (everything is incredibly symmetric) to the growing use of mirrors (these are heavily used to either literally translate words or to show the descent into madness), Kubrick’s framing is what leaves viewers scratching their heads, still to this date.

You’ll always find something new on another viewing. It might be from 1980, but it’s a movie that requires your full attention. Don’t underestimate films from the 20th century like you can’t be surprised by a film “that old” (you’ll be dumbfounded by dozens). If John Alcott’s cinematography is impressive, then what can I write about Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind’s haunting score? Nowadays, scores are more based on creating an emotional impact on specific moments. However, throughout the film and during dialogues, even epic films still have a subtlest approach to these scenes, and the music is either very quiet or completely inexistent.

In The Shining, the score is part of the conversation. If a character feels fear or danger is imminent, a simple heartbeat can elevate such a moment. If two characters gradually turn their dialogue into something more violent and aggressive, the music makes sure to accompany that descent into craziness. It’s a perfect horror film’s score. Technically, I’ll stop there because no words will be able to express how mind-blowing Kubrick’s visionary methods are. He’s one of the greatest directors ever, maybe even the most influential. Hopefully, his work will always be remembered and never stop being relevant.

Story-wise, The Shining also inspired a whole new generation. Everyone knows and loves the key moments of the film, but it’s the clever exposition that satisfies me. Every piece of information is given through either an incredibly captivating dialogue or visual clues/actions. I watched the 144min version of the film (the European version has 25min less than the American version, and the latter has a final scene at a hospital edited out by Kubrick himself), and pretty much every single scene is intended to mean something. It can be important new information or an update on a previous plot point, but every single sequence has a particular purpose.

Jack Nicholson commands the screen with a phenomenal performance, one of his career’s best. His script might be very well-written, but his delivery and commitment to the role are astonishing. He carries one-take, extense dialogues seamlessly. Credit to Kubrick for making a movie with at least 2/3-minute takes, sure, but Nicholson is able to transform a good scene into a fantastic one. Danny Lloyd delivers one of my favorite young performances ever. His voice as Tony is a great accomplishment, and he seems to understand his surroundings, in a way that I never felt like I needed to “go easy” on him because he’s just impeccable. 

Shelley Duvall, however, is a mixed bag for me. Over-the-top displays were better received at the time, but almost 40 years later, her performance does reach an unbearable level a few times. She’s an amazing counterpart for Nicholson and she stands her own within their dialogues, but when she’s alone or in an emotionally troubled moment, she’s too much to handle. Scatman Crothers doesn’t have that much screentime as Dick Halloran, but he shines every time he has to deliver a line. Some people complain about the slow pacing, but I love how it helps elevate the suspense and building up moments of immense tension. While the ending might be just a tad abrupt, the final image of the film stays with us forever, and after all this time, I still didn’t settle on my own theory.

All in all, The Shining might be one of the most accessible classics to new viewers of today to understand why it is, in fact, one of the greatest and most influential horror films of all-time. Stanley Kubrick’s masterclass in framing with his play on symmetry and mirrors is evident, so even if you don’t study the art of filmmaking, it’s clear that these two themes are vital to telling the story. In addition to his framing, his use of the innovative Steadicam and his notable mise-en-scene shaped an entire new generation that never misses a chance of paying homage to his work. Besides the impressive technical achievements, Jack Nicholson delivers a memorably haunting performance. The ending is still mind-blowing after all these years, and new theories keep coming up. While I’ll keep trying to settle on my own interpretation, don’t you dare spend the rest of your life without (re)watching this cult classic.

1091,John Chard,"Flips the scenario round from the original to great effect.

John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story.

The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.

Be it an horrific scene or a ""what is in the shadow"" sequence, the film is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming throughout the film.

The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it.

RELEASED IN 1982 and directed by John Carter, “The Thing” stars Kurt Russell as the helicopter pilot of an eleven-man crew at a research station in Antarctica who encounter a ghastly shape-shifting alien that perfectly replicates the appearance of its victims.

This is basically a sequel to the 1956 film and even includes footage from that classic sci-fi/horror. The creature is unconventional to say the least and this adds an eerie component to an already otherworldly and confined Antarctic setting.

There are no females and therefore no romantic complications. The characters are thin so the story focuses on the thing and how the crew tries to track it down and eliminate it, if they can. The nature of the gruesome entity, how it functions and how it can or cannot be killed leaves you with a lot of questions. The ending is haunting.

“The Thing” may not be as great as gushing devotees insist, but it’s solid sci-fi/horror with some pretty horrific scenes, although only one really creeped me out (the blood scene) while another made me bust out laughing (the torso jaws).

1091,DrewBlack,"1982 was a good year for alien movies. The people were not really ready for it, but it was. Not only did Spielberg’s friendly and warm-hearted E.T. - The Extraterrestrial debut at Cannes, and went on to become the world’s highest grossing film, but Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan made justice with a really good motion picture to the Star Trek TV series, and Liquid Sky shook up the indie cinema scene. And, of course, the release of John Carpenter’s gruesome, thrilling and tense take on John W. Campbell Jr.’s novella Who Goes There: The Thing, probably named because of the other adaptation of Campbell Jr.’s story, The Thing from Another World (1951). But not only did Carpenter’s The Thing do poorly at the box office, it was also heavily criticized for the raw material (some level of gore and on-screen autopsies of the creature). Almost four decades later, and the movie has gone through one of the biggest re-evaluations in cinema history, becoming a standard bearer for the horror “monster movie” subgenre, and a mandatory stop for cinephiles all over the world. How does a day make a difference.

One thing is certain: Nowadays, loved or hated, The Thing is still a topic of discussion. As far as this reviewer goes, I stand with the most recent evaluation. The Thing is an example of tension-building through dialogue, while also being a visually striking, fear-provoking monster flick. And, in the category of alien Sci-fi movies, it is up there with Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Alien (1979) and Predator (1987) in the race for the top spot.

The premise of the film, being synthesized, is that a group of norwegian scientists in Antarctica found a 100,000 year old UFO buried in the snow. They find a frozen creature next to it, and thaw it out. The norwegian team proceeds to be almost entirely slaughtered by the unknown beast, that is able to shapeshift into other life forms. A dog, that in reality is the creature, escapes, and is chased all the way to an american base. There, it is unknowingly welcomed, until the Americans investigate the norwegian base. They find about the powers of the Thing, and from there on, the film assumes a “who-do-I-trust” suspenseful setting. The pace is never slow, because the viewer is always on the edge of its seat.

The protagonist, R. J. MacReady, is brilliantly portrayed by Kurt Russell, in what would be his third collaboration with John Carpenter. The partnership started with the 1979 TV movie Elvis, and continued with Escape From New York (1981), The Thing (1982), Big Trouble in Little China (1986) and Escape From L.A. (1996). As always, the chemistry between actor and director is important to build up a good result in the form of the film. Here, Russell brings in powerful voice tones, and his characteristic sheer physicality to give his best portrayal of a helicopter pilot who must assume a leading position with his colleagues in order to fight an unknown threat. Amongst the supporting cast, noticeable names are Keith David (They Live), Wilford Brimley (Country) and Donald Moffat (Rachel, Rachel).

John Carpenter is almost guaranteed to knock it out of the park when it comes to horror, having The Fog (1980), Halloween (1978), and so many others under his direction. The Thing wouldn’t put him in critic’s graces in 1982, but in the long run, it would define his directorial style, and find its appreciation, being one of the career-defining works that cemented him as one of the authorities on the genre.

The soundtrack is beautiful, and that is not for no reason. John Carpenter himself and his long-time collaborator Alan Howarth composed some of the tracks together. The fact that the director himself composes the pieces ensures an extraordinary blend between scene and music. But not only that: for select parts of the score, Carpenter had the compositions of cinematic-music icon, Ennio Morricone. The legendary italian composer made the iconic soundtrack to Sergio Leone’s The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, apart from other big movies like The Untouchables and Death Rides a Horse. And to The Thing, he brought an electronic vibe, in order to approach Carpenter’s own style of music, while also incorporating european elements. The main theme for the film has its own deep meaning, representing the absorption process by the Thing, the main instrument being… An organ.

The visual effects were ahead of their time. So ahead of their time, that critics and casual cinemagoers alike bashed them for being “too gruesome” or  “too gross”. There are ways and ways to create fear. One of them is properly scaring people - using jumpscares, or tense and uncomfortable situations -, the other is to gross them out. And The Thing, even though it does scare in the first way really well, relishes in this second one, utilizing the advantage of working with the anatomy of a fictional creature, especially a shapeshifting one, to create horrific settings and on-screen situations. Examples of it are an autopsy of what seems to be a burned human being by the beginning, and the Thing absorbing a few alaskan malamute dogs.

The thing about… Uh, The Thing, is that it is one of the early 80s monster flicks that would set the bar high for many others to come. Despite not being well received at its time, it would find deserved recognition after a re-evaluation. It has great attributes such as strong acting, directing, visual effects and a killer soundtrack. In its setting of Antarctica, The Thing delivers proper ice cold chills. For a movie about a shapeshifting creature, this one finds itself being inimitable. Oh, the irony.",2021-02-11T11:39:37.080Z,10.0,The Thing,1982
1091,The Movie Mob,"**The Thing is a bloody disgusting groundbreaking masterpiece that reinvented cinema and reminded everyone that true fear lies in what can't be seen.**

The Thing might be the greatest horror creature film ever made. In an age where aliens were cute and friendly like E.T., John Carpenter's The Thing depicted a disturbing, grotesque creature of nightmare responsible for some of film's most terrifying body horror. The Thing was so far ahead of its time in horror and effects that it brought the terror into reality. Carpenter's brilliant decision to set the film in the frozen wilderness of Antarctica deepens the isolation and paranoia of every second. The practical effects are unbelievable and so impressive, allowing the actors to interact with the horror and make their performances that much more genuine and frightening. The Thing personifies paranoia as Kurt Russell's MacReady attempts to discover who is alien and who is not, with disgusting and disastrous consequences. Carpenter's The Thing is a gut-wrenching horror masterpiece that deserved so much more acclaim and recognition than it received upon its release.",2022-08-27T18:22:13.150Z,10.0,The Thing,1982
1091,CinemaSerf,"As remakes go, this is one of the better ones that I have seen - though I still prefer the degree of menace generated by the 1951 iteration. A man in an helicopter is shooting at a lonely mutt amidst the antarctic wilderness when it arrives at an American scientific base. An accident ensures the inhabitants cannot interrogate the pursuing Norwegians and a quick visit to their nearby camp shows that disaster has struck. A large block of hollowed out ice suggests, though, that they may well have made an unique discovery - especially when they find some smouldering skeletal remains. Back at their own camp - along with their new charcoaled find - things get back to normal until the mysterious dog is put into the cage with the others and all hell breaks loose. It is soon clear to ""Mac"" (Kurt Russell) that they are dealing with something extremely strong, adaptable and ruthless. Can they survive? The visual effects here go a long way to compensating for the rather lacklustre acting - Russell isn't really very good - and the claustrophobic antarctic settings and howling winds add a richness and sense of peril to this superior horror story. The fact that the creature has a sort of Azazel-like ability to transfer from any life-form to another, and to more than one simultaneously adds some decent jeopardy to the plot, too, as neither they nor us know who is to be trusted right until the ending. This is certainly one of John Carpenter's better efforts - and is well worth a watch on a cold winter's night!",2022-11-03T09:04:33.526Z,7.0,The Thing,1982
1091,CinemaSerf,"Told by way of a cycle of interconnected stories, this works well as a portmanteau of crimes and misdemeanours affecting a small town as it celebrates (or not!) Halloween. We start with a young couple returning from a party; the lady less enamoured with the occasion than her boyfriend. Suffice to say that there was no nookie for them that night (or ever again) as the series moves through a virgin, a group of glamorous vampires, a school principal with a penchant for the macabre and poor old Brian Cox's ""Kreeg"" who certainly has the most entertaining encounter with our tiny, pumpkin-headed, menace. The stories play well to our own fears and apprehensions, but there is also a soupçon of humour and a bit of a moral to it - suggesting, very strongly, that nay-sayers and folks who don't have treats are, quite literally, taking their lives in their own hands. There is no great reliance on visual effects. The presentation of the stories is characterful and genuinely scary a times without us looking for strings or CGI - and that makes this a more genuinely scary film that brings together many things evil and malevolent from the spiritual and fantasy worlds and couples them with some good old human vanity and nastiness. There is a sensible paucity of script - though some of Mr. Cox's one liners are potent, and Michael Dougherty allows the dark and eerie scenarios to evolve and facilitate the story with as few gimmicks as possible. Great fun, this.",2022-11-03T09:25:36.945Z,7.0,The Thing,1982
1091,Nathan,"The Thing is a claustrophobic, paranoia-driven horror film that follows a crew of American scientists trying to fend off an extraterrestrial monster before it picks them all off, one by one.

The film is incredibly grounded, in a way that increases the horror and tension surrounding our main cast. In the beginning, the story takes its time, building on the threat and fear of the creature. But this slowly transitions into a paranoia-stricken thriller that has everyone painted as a potential threat. This worked really well, keeping the audience constantly on their toes not knowing who to trust. Throughout the course of the film, there is not an incredible amount of action. The movie thrives on the tension that slowly builds through the characters distrust, but this lends itself to making the more action-packed scenes that much more effective. The prosthetic and prop department did such an incredible job on the effects. There are some really twisted scenes combining body gore and genuine horror that was ahead of its time.

Technically, this film is superb. The acting is great all around, but Kurt Russell shines in this role, taking over every scene he is in. The score is subtle but adds a sense of ominousness to the film that I really appreciated. Cinematography is top notch, with some impressive set designs and creative shots that create a great amount of immersion.

Overall, this film is amazing. Although it does impact me as much as Halloween did, it is still an instant classic that should go down as John Carpenter's 1B to his Halloween masterpiece.

Verdict: Excellent",2023-02-17T14:02:40.509Z,9.0,The Thing,1982
1091,whitsbrain,"I've seen this movie so many times. I own it twice on DVD, I own it on 4K, Blu-Ray and I even have a copy on the now defunct HD-DVD format. I regret not seeing it in the theaters back in 1982. I don't know why I didn't go. I was certainly old enough to appreciate it. Instead, I saw ""E.T."". I got swept up in happy little alien fever. I went with the crowd. All I had to do was wander over to a different screen and watch Carpenter's creation in all its paranoid glory. Sigh...

As with all good movies, music, or books, I experience something new every time I view it. I keep trying to piece together how the Thing spread throughout the camp. I keep looking for clues. Like when Blair performs an autopsy on the recently roasted Thing. While he's presenting his thoughts on what the Thing is, he absent-mindedly taps his pencil eraser on the steaming carcass, crosses his arms and brings the pencil eraser perilously close to his mouth. Then he makes a talking point by waving the pencil in the air and ever so briefly...it touches his lip! Did he infect himself? Is it too late?!?!? Has the Thing spread itself to Blair?!?! These kinds of moments fill the movie. It so suspenseful and so paranoid. And the isolation is torture. You know they all have nowhere to go. All those nameless men. Well, they aren't nameless, it's just that it's hard to remember them all. And the strange thing about it is, we still seem to care about them. I think that's because Carpenter has done such a masterful job of building the suspense through threat and isolation that we can't help but subconsciously put ourselves into their places.

There are so many great scenes. The opening helicopter-chases-dog scene. The horror of finding the Thing in the dog pen. The death and subsequent transformation of Norris. Wow! Is it gory! And in this particular case, I think the gore is absolutely necessary. That's kind of the knock on this film. The gore has been classified as extreme. And it is. But this is a story about such a faceless, out-of-this-world beast that it all seems so appropriate. And those effects. I don't think I need to say any more than others have already posited about the very special practical effects by Rob Bottin. They have to be the best I've ever seen.

Then there's the ""blood test"" scene. All of the men at the Antarctic station volunteer to give a blood sample and then have it tested, while tied to chairs, to see if it reveals which of them are actually the ""Thing"". One by one, a heated copper wire is placed into a petri dish of blood from each one of the men. Seeing the smoke rise from the wire when it's touched to the dish of blood brings some relief. Will the next dish be Thing-free? You'll have to watch it and see for yourself. The setup and execution of this scene is one of the most intense and frightening things I've ever watched.

I am very happy that this film has found its place thanks to Home Video. It's now considered a Horror/Sci-Fi classic. It is without a doubt my favorite Horror movie, perhaps my favorite monster flick and quite possibly my top Sci-Fi feature. It's that good.",2024-01-30T19:49:27.581Z,10.0,The Thing,1982

538858,badelf,A **very** atypical Hindi film in that it is both a fantasy and a horror. It is a well-told fable about greed. Totally worth the watch!,2022-02-03T01:59:20.368Z,8.0,Tumbbad,2018
538858,r96sk,"<em>'Tumbbad'</em> is very good folk horror fare. It's a movie that feels unusual for what Bollywood tends to offer, at least the sorta films that I've checked out from this part of the world. Aside from the evidently irremovable music interlude, it felt different - a good different.

I would say that the story gets a bit underwhelming across the middle portion, though the opening chunk and final moments are impressive - both featuring young actors, in my opinion this flick is at its strongest with Dhundiraj Jogalekar and Mohammad Samad (plus Jyoti Malshe, Rudra Soni) onscreen.

The special effects for when the characters are involved with Hastar aren't the greatest, but the film undoubtedly makes it work and it still adds the required creepiness. The practical effects for the 'old woman' are excellent though, very unnerving.

Story-wise it is sturdy, it's fairly straightforward in terms of the message of greed but it works and is portrayed nicely. As noted, if not for a meandering middle I'd be rating this higher. All the same, it's a suitably entertaining movie and one that's worthy of recommendation.",2025-04-18T01:35:53.644Z,8.0,Tumbbad,2018

Friedkin's The Exorcist is a film that shocks rather than scares. A well made film that achieved notoriety via pea soup. A slow and intelligent film with strong performances - yet also a mostly disappointing one for those who dare to go beyond the hype and actually _experience_ it for the first time.

9552,RalphRahal,"The Exorcist (1973) is one of those horror films that sticks with you long after the credits roll. It sets itself apart with an eerie, slow-building tension rather than relying on cheap scares. The story follows a young girl who begins exhibiting disturbing behavior, leading her mother to seek help from both medical professionals and, eventually, the church. The plot is simple but highly effective, creating an unsettling atmosphere that feels grounded in reality. It doesn’t waste time on unnecessary subplots, keeping the focus tight and the tension high.

William Friedkin’s direction is masterful, balancing realism with the supernatural in a way that makes everything feel disturbingly possible. The opening in the desert is a great example, setting up the film’s themes with a quiet unease before shifting to the main story. The cinematography reinforces the horror without feeling over-stylized, using dim lighting, tight framing, and cold color tones to build dread. The way the camera lingers just long enough on certain shots makes you feel like you’re watching something you shouldn’t be.

The acting is phenomenal across the board, but the standout performance is from Linda Blair as the possessed girl. She delivers a chilling performance that makes the supernatural feel shockingly real. Ellen Burstyn and Max von Sydow bring depth to their roles, adding weight to the film’s emotional core. The dialogue feels natural, which makes the disturbing moments hit even harder. The script is smartly written, giving just enough exposition without over-explaining, letting the horror unfold naturally.

The sound design and score elevate the entire experience. The use of silence is just as effective as the unsettling sounds that creep in at the right moments. The film’s signature theme, Tubular Bells, is simple yet haunting, perfectly setting the tone for the film. The shock scenes are well-timed and never feel excessive, keeping the horror grounded rather than over-the-top. The Exorcist still holds up today as one of the most well-crafted horror films ever made, blending strong storytelling, unsettling direction, and incredible performances into something unforgettable.",2025-02-13T20:59:13.510Z,9.0,The Exorcist,1973

Headmaster of a boarding school, Michel Delaselle (Paul Meurisse) is a brooding bully of a man, one day his wife and mistress decide enough is enough and plot to kill him, trouble is that once they murder him, his body disappears and reported sightings of him are adding to the ladies' paranoia.

Thus is the setting for director Henri-Georges Clouzot's brilliant suspenser. The pace is stiflingly perfect, he gently racks up the tension, neatly toying with audience expectation, the sense of dread that hangs in the air is palpable. How refreshing it is to see a suspense film actually build its plot for a good hour? In this day and age the MTV generation would be walking out of this after 30 minutes. Armand Thirard's atmospheric photography accentuates the creeping menace like mood, to the point that when we get to the last 15 minutes, nerves are already frayed and we then of course get what is arguably the greatest bath scene ever, and ""that"" ending... 

When I first watched it back in 2008 it was on a poor quality DVD, but revisiting it on Blu-ray it still worked me over as the great suspense movie it is, forcing me to seek the solace of daylight ASAP. Great writing, great directing, great acting, the latter thriving due to Simone Signoret's dangerously simmering sexuality and Véra Clouzot's heartfelt vulnerability. It's one of the classic chillers of European cinema. And if you haven't seen it yet?

805,CinemaSerf,"I've never found Mia Farrow to be a very versatile actor, but she certainly delivers the best performance of her career in this gripping story of Satanic manipulation. ""Rosemary"" is married to ""Guy"" (John Cassavetes) and they live in one of those lovely great buildings that overlook New York's Central Park. Their neighbours are a bit eccentric, to day the least, with ""Minnie"" (the almost perfect Ruth Gordon) and ""Roman"" (Sidney Blackmer) chief amongst those who take an increasing interest in this couple when it appears that a baby is on the way. Gradually, she begins to suspect that something is amiss with not just her pregnancy, but with her marital relationship as she seems to see less and less of those previously close to her and becomes little better than a prisoner in her own apartment. She is becoming increasingly paranoid, confused and resentful of a seemingly indofferent husband who seems content to let just about everyone interfere as the due date approaches. This is also Roman Polanski at his best as he manages to amalgamate the sinister and the coercive with the religiosity of a story that exudes menace and panic whilst also calling into question established societal values around faith and trust. It's almost claustrophobic by design, and their small apartment soon takes on the mantle of a cell occupied by a woman who is very much not in control of her own destiny - whichever way she tries to turn, and with the careful use of a score from Christopher Komeda that could rival Bernard Herrmann then we have a story of visceral fear that looks great on a big screen.

Bette Davis is the former, rather petulant, child star ""Baby Jane"" who rather grudgingly looks after her sister - the more critically acclaimed actress ""Blanche"" (Joan Crawford) as their dotage approaches in their Hollywood home. ""Blanche"" is largely confined to a wheelchair, so is entirely dependent on her increasingly alcoholic, flaky and downright nasty sibling. Thing is, though, it's Blanche who has the money - and when she starts to discuss selling their house this riles her sister who soon has some pretty menacing thoughts about thwarting this ""betrayal"". Luckily for ""Blanche"" - their maid ""Elvira"" (Maidie Norman) starts to become aware of this rather menacing change in attitude, and well... Crawford and Davis are very much at the top of their games here, and somehow you can't help but wonder if they were really acting their socks off, or whether there was a serious bit of professional ""loathing"" going on on the set of this deftly directed Robert Aldrich classic. There is a positive sense of venom here from Davis, and her counterpart portrays the traumatised victim with great aplomb. Neither woman is afraid to ditch their more traditional glamour. Davis looks truly demented in her part as the woman with one hand on the bottle and the other on the door handle of the sanatorium - and she excels in the part. It's almost 2¼ hours long and it positively flies by. The pace is perfect, the DeVol score ebbs and flows with the frequently pithy and powerful dialogue and the photography - often tight and intimate makes this a superb example of the ultimate cinema sibling rivalry.

With panic setting in and tempers flaring, it's down to this intrepid bunch to stop from being munched upon and facing a fate worse than death. It's it's very normality that makes this work. Ordinary people, thinking on their feet, dealing with a catastrophe whilst simultaneously coping with the daft problems of day-to-day, turbulent, relationships. The writing is quickly paced and frequently quite witty, with engaging and cohesive efforts from the two at the top of the bill, but also from the briefly used Bill Nighy and the always reliable Wilton who has considerable skill when it comes to comedy timing and accompanying facial expressions. I can't say I've ever seen a collection of vinyl LPs used as an offence weapon before, and that sets the tone for the entertainingly spoofy daftness of the proceedings that isn't maybe the most original ninety minutes of cinema you'll ever have seen, but it stays the right side of slapstick and is good fun throughout.",2024-10-09T10:08:29.791Z,7.0,Shaun of the Dead,2004

653,CinemaSerf,"If you were ever to be able to commit your imagination to film when you read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" then I expect you would struggle to come up with anything more vivid than this. What is most striking is the wonderful detail as poor old estate agent ""Hutter"" is despatched to the home of ""Count Orlok"" (Max Schreck) to negotiate the acquisition of an isolated house for him. Once he arrives at the castle, we are subsumed in the eeriness and wickedness as it becomes clear that ""Orlok"" is an epitome of evil. Our story follows the travels of the ""Count"" from his castle to his new home - wreaking plague and havoc as he goes - until he arrives in the town inhabited by ""Ellen"" (a superbly vulnerable yet strong Greta Schröder) - the wife of the estate agent who is hot on their heals. ""Ellen"" has an inkling as to how to kill their nemesis, but that would involve the ultimate sacrifice. Now I have a few slight niggles with it - the inter-titles in a gothic script are, frequently, very difficult to read and that does interrupt the narrative; the editing is just a little too brutal at times and I found the score oppressive - even on the more joyous, or optimistic, scenes it seemed just a bit too overpowering than is necessary, but these are trifles when compared to the beautiful photography. Schreck is magnificent in the title role, exuding menace and malevolence, Gustav von Wangenheim (""Hutter"") conveys the sense of desperation and terror in a truly evocative manner and it all adds up to a taut horror film the likes of which you'll never see in any subsequent treatment of this story.",2022-06-06T16:53:54.489Z,7.0,Nosferatu,1922

13310,CinemaSerf,"A child of divorced parents, “Oskar” (Kåre Hedebrant) is frequently the victim of a trio of school bullies and at night, in the snow-covered park near his Stockholm home, he dreams of finally fighting back. One such night, he encounters the curious girl-next-door and over a period of evenings the pair start to become friends. She is “Eli” (Lina Leandersson) and she is quite a mysterious young girl. She is twelve, like him, but has no idea when her birthday is and she is also particularly adept at solving the Rubik’s cube (I usually had to dismantle mine and rebuild it!). All the while, their community is being rocked by the discovery of some exsanguined bodies, and so might “Oskar” be able to put two and two together and is he in even more danger from his new friend that from his school-day antagonists? We know all along who is doing what to whom, so a mystery this isn’t. What is is, though, is a characterful story of young love as both have their demons to address. There’s a little bit of ketchup now and again, but this isn’t really a gore fest either. Indeed, for much of the film the dirty work is being done by her equally enigmatic guardian “Håkan” (Per Ragnar) leaving the story to focus more some of the less tangible clues she drip feeds her new friend. She “isn’t a girl” can mean so many things? She’s just twelve but for how long has she been “just twelve”? Perhaps she sees in “Oskar” a new guardian? From his part, “Oskar” must begin to decide for himself whether the revenge he seeks on his tormentors is the right course of action, or whether he ought to move on with his life and build upon the positivity of his innocent, and reciprocated, attraction to “Eli”. Both of these actors deliver really quite engagingly throughout; their dialogue is measured and authentically childlike and even through the plot deals with some fairly gruesome topics, those never derail the amiability of the film and there’s even a little comedy woven into the proceedings too. The chilly landscape, the dark evenings, the nearby woods and the consistent pacing of the tale create a warmth untypical of this genre and it’s a surprisingly sensitive and addictive watch. If you’re looking for Peter Cushing or Brad Pitt, then maybe not - otherwise, this is a good watch.",2025-09-06T15:58:47.222Z,7.0,Let the Right One In,2008

Also, for it being an 85+ year old movie, the special effects STILL stand up rather well and STILL look convincingly realistic. In fact, I believe these FX are of a better quality than the 1976 remake and even comes close to the 2005 CGI version.

I will start this by giving my ratings, yes plural because to me as a sci-fi/action film fan the film has few peers, it is 100% pure suspense testo explosive fun that along side John McTiernan's other action template Die Hard, stands the test of time to the point that it will be thrilling viewers long after we have left this earth. So with that I give it a personal rating of 10/10, it's faultless for my needs in a genre I indulge and lose myself in on a frequent roster. For any other movie fan aware of the genre's traits and peccadilloes without being a fan of sorts, then I rate the film easily at 7 or 8 out of 10, what's not to like here?

The film is without a shadow of a doubt another allegory of Vietnam, a crack unit of soldiers are stuck in a central American jungle being killed off by an invisible enemy, the soldiers are there after being lied to by the powers that be, tactics are paramount but the enemy that stalks them holds all the aces. This crack special rescue team are a testosterone fuelled band of beef, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham, Bill Duke & Jesse Ventura, these five alone have a combined muscle weight heavy enough to have sunk the Titanic, and McTiernan uses the beefcakes to the max in a series of joyous ball busting sequences.

The dialogue is sharp and funny with Schwarzenegger quipping his way thru the first reel, and the score from Alan Silvestri pumps the blood at just the right time, whilst the effects crew have done sterling work to bring this ""hardest man in the world versus bad ass alien predator"" to life, none more so than when viewing POV heat seeking infa-red shots as our deadly alien killer. The end throws up some interesting thoughts, that have for better or worse? Been fleshed out with further films involving the predator of the title, but one should judge this film as a single entry because it sits at the top of the tree as one of the best of it's kind; so truly this is a benchmark for the genre that will take some beating as far as I'm concerned.

An elite squad of commandos is enlisted for a mission to the jungles of Central America to rescue some VIPs after their helicopter is downed. They soon discover that they are hunted by some kind of predator… not of this world. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers star.

“Predator” (1987) mixes jungle action with otherworldly sci-fi for satisfying adventure/horror. The macho cast is superb, counterbalanced by Elpidia Carrillo as Anna. The flick’s iconic and uber-“cool” with exceptional jungle locations and cinematography, as well as F/X that hold up. Unfortunately, there’s little depth. It’s enjoyable as a popcorn movie, but also forgettable. Catch “Apocalypse Now” (1979) for the real deal in jungle adventure/horror.

Once there they find themselves the prey of someone, something, that has ninja skills to die for - and, well, they do! Slowly and brutally picked off one by one, it becomes the ultimate battle for survival. This is my favourite from John McTiernan. He manages to use well, the claustrophobic environment; the heat-sensitive camera work is effective and the ascending sense of menace as these hardened men gradually realise that they are out of their depth is gripping. It builds tensely to a denouement that even has a degree of honour to it. Nope, of course the writing is never going to win a Pulitzer, nor is the acting offering us interestingly nuanced or delicate performances.

The idea being that he wants the killer to suffer and suffer and suffer, again and again, until his fear is as great as that of his victims, before he kills him.

I Saw The Devil is not without its faults; at almost two-and-a-half hours, it's too long, the brutal nature of the characters threatens to slide into absurdity especially when our killer takes refuge with a cannibalistic mate who doesn't mind his wife being raped (she doesn't mind, either; I guess your standards slip when your old man eats people for shits & giggles), and the concept of getting this serial rapist/killer to a point of sheer terror, like his victims - is flawed; this guy, as played by Min-sik Choi, is NEVER going to feel any fear. And so it is, by the end, rendering the whole catch/release premise redundant. That said, it's gripping, it's tense throughout much of the runtime, the lead performances are superb, it's astonishingly violent and gory, but it's meted out just right; more Seven than Saw, and it is photographed exquisitely.

923,Wuchak,"Romero’s imaginative and thrilling zombie sequel 

A decade after the excellent “Night of the Living Dead” (1968), writer/director George Romero offers up this exceptional sequel. The plague of reanimated corpses with a hunger for warm flesh is now global and society is increasingly breaking down. A television exec (Gaylen Ross), her helicopter-reporter beau (David Emge) and two SWAT officers (Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger) take refuge in a suburban mall. Unfortunately for them, a veritable army of biker-raiders wants the mall for their own.

One of the main reasons this film is so iconic is because Romero seriously considered what it would be like after a ‘zombie apocalypse’ and came up with an inspired story. While the bleakness of the situation is addressed there’s also a sense of adventurous freedom; for instance, the protagonists having an entire mall to themselves.

The movie’s disturbing, ghastly and gory, but also action-packed and sometimes humorous. The zombies make for good bullet fodder while, at the same time, satirizing consumer society. The creative score is varied and I’m sure it was cutting edge at the time, but it’s very dated today, although you’ll probably find yourself acclimating to it. The no-name cast is convincing with the towering Foree standing out while Emge comes across as a poor man’s Donald Sutherland.

The movie runs 2 hours, 7 minutes with the longer version running 2 hours, 19 minutes (the one I watched). It was shot in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, and nearby Pittsburgh.

Firstly, allow me to clarify: I am not a fan of “zombie” films, although I understand very well the interest that, in recent years, there has been for this material. I totally respect those who enjoy it. But let's be honest: a film has to have some aesthetic quality and some good taste to become “digestible”. And, well, I just finished watching this film, and I honestly can't understand how it has survived without ending up in the vault of oblivion. There are incredibly better films that have been forgotten as the years pass, but a certain type of crap, purely and simply because it's bad, lives on.

The plot is essentially based on a moment of chaos in which the USA (the rest of the world does not exist) is taken over by zombies and no one knows what to do or where to go. Everyone thinks of themselves, saves their own skin and that's it. In the meantime, the usual opportunists take advantage of the situation as they see fit, and a small group of “surviving heroes” look for somewhere to take shelter. It's the plot of this film and a dozen other disaster films (zombies, volcanoes, wars, earthquakes, alien invasions, you name it). The level of originality is below zero, and the situations are all predictable and highly cliché. We know who is going to die and who is going to be saved by a whisker, and the fact that the film starts without any kind of introduction is just confusing and a little stupid.

Directed by George A. Romero, a man who must have suffered from some bizarre sexual fetish with dead people and zombies (look at his filmography!), the film is absolutely trash and could compete in poor quality and bad taste with all of Ed's films Wood and with the historical rigor of Ridley Scott's period films. I lost count of the script problems, continuity errors and gross editing errors. The cinematography is ugly, there is a blatant exaggeration of the sets and the zombies' makeup is so obviously fake that they look like what we did at fifteen in school plays. And we'd better not even talk about the cast: I have doubts whether those people were actors.",2024-03-14T06:08:15.441Z,1.0,Dawn of the Dead,1978
10331,Nathan,"Night of the Living Dead is without a doubt a fantastically innovative film; creating the modern day interpretation of a zombie and forever changing the genre as we know it. There is a lot to like about this film, but unfortunately the limitations of its time hold it back, resulting in a somewhat boring viewing experience. 

For starters, the story was pretty good. I really enjoyed how the plot focused on a single group of survivors and their thought process as they attempt to deal with the horror and panic of the dead reanimating. There was a tremendous amount of lore delivered via telecommunication broadcasts that I thought added to the movie perfectly. 

The performances were uneven, some were quite stellar, particularly Duane Jones and Karl Hardman. But Judith O’Dea was quite bad. I’m not sure if it was her performance or the way her character was written but it was just bizarre to see her body language and gestures throughout the film. The beginning chase scene with her was fantastic, with some stellar cinematography. But after that, the way she portrayed shock was laughable. 

The action in this movie was bad, with punches being all too slow and clunky. I would imagine this movie was quite scary for the time, but with modern day horror constantly elevating, I hardly found myself unnerved. Overall, this movie is Time Capsule for horror and the genre has taken so much from this film throughout the years, but unfortunately it’s legacy far outweighs the entertainment the film brings.

10331,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**The film that practically founded the zombie subgenre.**

As I've said on other occasions, I'm not a fan at all of films about zombies and similar creatures. It's a type of horror cinema with a strong graphic appeal that doesn't really captivate me. However, I confess that I liked this film. It is much more moderate in its approach to these types of monsters, and effective in building tension and suspense. It's not scary (I believe it was very scary at the time, but these are different times), but it's entertaining.

The story told doesn't give us much explanation: we see two brothers who visit a grave in an isolated cemetery and, upon returning to the car, they are chased by what looks like a very disturbed man. It's obviously a zombie, and we know it, but the characters don't know and are extremely confused by what happens next: a growing group of zombies attacks them and forces them to seek shelter in a nearby house, where shortly afterwards they realize that they are not alone and, thanks to radio and television, that the problem is not just there, but it's national.

George Romero was very intelligent in the way he conceived and wrote the film, which is an entirely independent production and the result of the ingeniously of everyone involved. It is an innovative work, it was one of the first films to bring zombies to the horror universe and the influence of “Carnival of Souls” is very clear in the cinematography, in the way the sound and soundtrack were worked on. The short budget forced the production to be very pragmatic and efficient, to do a lot with little and prioritize credibility and authenticity. I would like to highlight some effective effects such as the flesh eaten by zombies, fake blood and Molotov cocktails. The design of the sets and choice of filming locations is also to be congratulated.

The cast has a few points in its favor, but it is essentially amateur and only tries to do what has to be done. Despite being a minor issue and not usually subjected to reflection, it seems significant to me to highlight the choice of a black actor for the main role. Duane Jones, in the film of his life, does a very well done job, with great commitment and that fulfills everything necessary. Karl Hardman is just annoying and the two actresses, Judith O’Dea and Marilyn Eastman, don’t really add anything positive to the film, simply appearing helpless the whole time.",2024-04-11T20:22:07.057Z,5.0,Night of the Living Dead,1968

Tod Browning's Freaks is as infamous today as it was back in the 30s when it shook film watchers to the core. Of course time has diluted some of its impact, you can imagine that a modern day horror fan drooling over torture porn et al being completely bemused by the reputation afforded Freaks. Yet it still remains a unique and nightmarish piece of film making, the sort of picture that if someone like David Lynch had made it in the modern era it would be heralded as a masterpiece of daring and genius like artistry.

Browning pulls us the viewers into this bizarre carnival society of oddities who are genuinely portrayed by real people. Their codes and ethics are laid bare, but not in some sort of yearning for sympathy, but in a factual way of life. Browning toys with his audience, planting suggestive images of sexual dalliances and role reversals, then he completely pulls the rug from under us to deliver his flip-flop finale. 

The messages aren't deep, but they need to be thought about. For even as the freaks of Browning's play terrifyingly pursue their quarry through the rain and mud, as the blood freezes and the macabre imagery strikes the senses, it would be a shame if themes such as love and loyalty be forgotten. 9/10",2014-04-26T11:52:04.293Z,9.0,Freaks,1932
136,tmdb17996075,"If I have to be honest, I'd say that I have uncertain opinions concerning this film on the whole. On the one hand, I can't say that I didn't enjoy 'Freaks', mainly because of its nice display of bizarre cast members. On the other hand, I can't help feeling slightly at fault, considering that these were real people who probably suffered a lot in their lives because of their malformations, something they obviously couldn't help. Here's a movie that basically became popular precisely because it's about real life 'freaks' (?) and here's the audience that somehow takes pleasure from a film that consciously makes profit out of unfortunate human beings. Being aware of this, I can't lie and say that I didn't enjoy this movie, because… I honestly did!. I'm not going to say that 'Freaks' fascinated me because of the plot, or the locations or the unspoken moral, because even though all those things were fine too, I mostly wanted to see the film because of its characters, that's the reality. However, I suppose it is not so bad to enjoy this movie because of this reason, considering that these people actually agreed to appear in the movie and the fact that they appeared here, didn't make their lives any better or worse, so in the end… it's not really a crime, but I can't help having vague ideas about it. As the movie begins, we see a scrolling prologue, which pretty much encourages the audience to root for the side-show performers and incite us to feel terrible for them, since people with deformities has been always predestined to the most awful chastisements and degradations… which worked for me!. I felt really bad at first, but in the end, it was comprehensible that this film clearly tries to give a message in a far-reaching and yet hideously pleasurable approach. Therefore, my personal opinion, is that the title 'Freaks', doesn't necessarily have to be a reference to the side-show performers with malformations and perhaps, it may be an allusion to the fully grown characters who were the real freaks because of their wicked hearts.

In 'Freaks' the story revolves around a circus that offers all kinds of shows, including the exhibition of people with malformations as if they were exotic animals. Cleopatra, a beautiful and promiscuous trapeze artist from the circus, maliciously deceives an innocent midget named Hans and makes him believe that she is in love with him. On the other hand, Frieda, Hans' former fiancée, hopelessly tries to warn his beloved one and make him realize that Cleopatra is just making fun of him deliberately and that she's only with him because of his money. Ignoring Frieda's friendly warning, Hans eventually marries the trapeze artist, only to realize that she was indeed poking fun at him from the very beginning and that her only business with him is to poison him to inherit his wealth later. However, the rest of the side-show performers become aware of this and decide to rise up against the vicious Cleopatra and her lover Hercules.

Like I said, the film is remarkably engaging and regardless of the unassuming plot and the short duration, it still doesn't leave the audience with a feeling of disappointment. For the contrary, during that short hour and four minutes, the movie pretty much develops all the necessary conflicts, situations, beautiful music, nice scenarios and perfect interaction between the characters. Tod Browning managed to achieve a highly compelling drama flick with some of the finest and most atypical actors, who captivate the audience with their charm and innocence. Give this movie a chance and decide which ones are the real freaks and which ones aren't.",2017-02-14T00:23:15.907Z,7.0,Freaks,1932

The fear, confusion, and longing that the novel describes are evident in the monster's actions, to the point of pushing the audience to root for him.

The rest of the characters are also a bit of fun. Baron Frankenstein, played by Fred Kerr, was also a hoot. He played a no-nonsense character that functioned well in the comic-relief role needed with Edward Van Sloan's Dr. Wladman and Mae Clarke's Elizabeth being quite serious, even dramatic. Colin Clive, the man who played Doctor Henry, did a decent job in his role as well, pulling off the role of being consumed by his work, even when he desired to be free from it. 

The acting, overall, was a touch more theatrical than I would prefer in a horror movie, but it wasn't so distracting that it pulled me out of the film. The film is a ton of fun to watch, but I do have to say it isn't exactly terrifying. The atmospheric creepiness is somewhat lacking compared to modern-era horror, even going back fifty years. That being said, the movie, if thought about and rewatched, does a good job of displaying how the fear of the unknown, and letting that fear take over, can be the real monster.",2018-10-04T16:31:19.139Z,8.0,Frankenstein,1931

We will always see debates about which of the original wave of Universal Monster movies is the most important. With Dracula being released just under a year before Frankenstein, that tends to give the vampire crowd a sense of justifiable cause for a trumpet fanfare. Perhaps the more pertinent question is which is the better movie? Surely the most hardened of Dracula fans have to bow their heads in acknowledgement that Frankenstein quite simply is superior on every level - even if it itself is not as good as its sequel...

Narrative doesn't quite follow Mary Shelley's original source material (what a brain that lady had!), but the core essence of a tragic tale holds tight. Directing was one James Whale, who here was in his directorial infancy, he himself up for debate about greatest horror genre directors, but his masterful sense of theatrical staging, and that of the terror incarnate for the era, is sublime to the point that come 100 years after its release this will still be held up as a timeless horror classic.

The thematics of the story pulse with brilliance, the advent of berserker science, the alienation and confusion flow of the creature grips and stings the heart equally. The later camp of Whale's horror ventures is mostly absent here, instead we have a dark almost miserably bleak tone, which exists right up to the end title card which brings closure after the brilliant and iconic finale has made its mark. Jack Pierce's marvelous make-up and the birth of Karloff as a genre legend seals the deal on what is without doubt one of the genre's most important films. 9/10",2019-10-26T16:37:18.050Z,9.0,Frankenstein,1931

I thought about coming at this review from the perspective of what 1931's _Frankenstein_ meant for the future of cinema, and how it was still essentially in its infancy and doing anything even close to what _Frankenstein_ did, changing the culture forever and remaining in the zeitgeist even now, almost a hundred years later, is a monumental achievement and should be viewed as such. But that's never really been my jam. _Frankenstein_ might have been great for the time, I don't know, I wasn't there, but I personally only ever found it to be okay. Re-watching it this Halloween was, I think the fourth time I've given it a go, and it's really not as enthralling as people seem to give it credit for. My roommate fell asleep. It's not that it's black and white either, it just doesn't have as clear a philosophical intention as the book, nor as gripping an output as more modern offerings.

This Universal classic from 1931 was based on the 1927 play by Peggy Webling rather than Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel. For those interested in versions fairly faithful to the book, I suggest Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version with De Niro as the creature or the 2004 version with Luke Goss as the monster, the latter of which runs almost 3 hours.  

Of course, the gist of Shelley’s story is here and this is the movie that set the standard for the proverbial ""mad"" scientist with a hunchbacked assistant. While I’m not a fan of B&W movies, it works here to give the illusion of a Bavarian village back in the day.  Speaking of which, the director said the story takes place in an ""alternate universe,"" which explains the peculiar mixing of technology & fashions from 1930 (when the film was shot) with elements of the early 1800s.

At the end of the day, this is a truncated, but iconic version of the Frankenstein story, a Gothic horror tragedy highlighted by Boris Karloff’s unforgettable rendition of the monster.   

The movie runs 1 hour, 10 minutes, and was shot at Universal Studios and various spots in the greater Los Angeles area (Malibou Lake, Vasquez Rocks and Pasadena).

The acting and the dialogue are a bit on the basic side, especially from Clarke, but even now this looks great on a big screen and plays wonderfully to the attitudes and superstitions of the time - of writing and production.

Oh willow I die, oh willow I die... 

 

Based on Henry James' novel, The Turn Of The Screw, The Innocents is a thoroughly absorbing chiller that pot boils with almost unbearably knowing glee as to what it's doing to the viewer. Deborah Kerr stars as Miss Giddens, the lady hired by Michael Redgrave to act as governess to his young niece and nephew. We find ourselves in Victorian England, out on some country estate at Bly Mansion, where the children are angelic and enchanting in equal measure. Yet there’s an eeriness hanging over this place and it starts to seemingly play tricks on Miss Giddens' mind, she thinks she sees and hears things. It's only when she talks to housekeeper Mrs Grose (Megs Jenkins), that she starts to piece things together, but worryingly it's the children that appear to be at the root of the problems. Aren’t they?

 

Kerr is fabulous here, carrying an elegant gait around with her, she does a fine line in borderline hysteria caused by something unknown bubbling away under the surface. Filmed on location at Sheffield Park and Gardens, and the Bluebell Railway in East Sussex, this lovely Gothic chiller does justice to its literate source. Being co-scripted by Truman Capote, William Archibald and John Mortimer, that's really not much of a surprise in truth though is it?! Choosing to play on the viewers imagination more than pandering to shocks, director Jack Clayton superbly creates a sort of itchy like sense of dread. He’s fully aware that here in and around the Gothic abode, it’s more often than not what you don’t see – or think you see - that is more frightening.

 

Ace cinematographer Freddie Francis does a marvellous job with the photography, with deep focus and shadows the order of the day, and with Clayton sharp cutting and dallying with angles; and Georges Auric’s sinister music floating around the estate like some spectral peeping tom, the atmosphere created is akin to claustrophobic foreboding. In many ways it's actually an uncomfortable watch, but for all the right reasons, the themes that rumble away are grim in texture, the question of malevolent evil or otherwise is a constant, and fittingly the finale offers up a shocking denouement that is nigh on impossible to shake off. With great performances from the child actors (Pamela Franklin/Martin Stephens) sealing the deal, The Innocents is one of the smartest and most effective chillers to ever have come out of Britain. 9/10",2013-11-02T03:25:21.240Z,9.5,The Innocents,1961
16372,Wuchak,"_**Low-key Gothic horror with Deborah Kerr**_

A new governess (Deborah Kerr) takes over as nanny of two orphaned siblings at a remote English manor at the turn of the century, but there’s a secretive past to the situation and seemingly ghostly happenings. Pamela Franklin plays the girl.  

""The Innocents” (1961) is a cinematic version of Henry James 1898 novella “The Turn of the Screw,” shot in B&W. It’s technically well-made and has Gothic mood, but the story is intrinsically one-dimensional, resting on the shoulders of Kerr and essentially only involving three other actors. 

Like the original tale, there’s ambiguity: Is the governess hallucinating or is she really seeing what she claims? One thing that lends credence to the latter view is the fact that she is able to describe one of the persons she sees before even knowing he existed.

If you like this movie, check out the unofficial prequel with Marlon Brando and Stephanie Beacham, “The Nightcomers” (1971). While it lacks the ghostly elements, it imaginatively sets the stage for this movie (and James’ original story) in an edgy way à la ""Last Summer"" (1969) and ""The Sailor who Fell from Grace with the Sea"" (1976).

The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot at Sheffield Park Garden, Dane Mill, Uckfield, East Sussex, England, and Shepperton Studios southwest of London, plus points nearby.

This is a cracking tale of science fiction, horror and even romance as the monster ends up endowed with far more ""humanity"" than either scientist. Una O'Connor and Elsa Lanchester are both great too, though feature sparingly.

229,Wuchak,"**_Dr. Frankenstein and his former mentor try to create a mate for the monster_**

The monster (Karloff) survives the windmill burning of the previous film and wanders the countryside of Bavaria while Doctor Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) approaches Baron Frankenstein (Colin Clive) with the idea of collaborating to create a mate for the monster, which presumably will domesticate him. 

This Universal classic from 1935 was one of the first sequels to a mainstream film and arguably started the concept of a movie franchise or, at least, a cinematic trilogy: The 1931 movie, this sequel, and the follow-up “Son of Frankenstein” (1939) all feature Boris Karloff as the monster along with other overlapping actors and characters. It has a story arc and comes to a clear ending in the third flick. 

Valerie Hobson is a highlight on the female front as Elizabeth Frankenstein (replacing Mae Clarke from the first film). Meanwhile Elsa Lanchester plays the dual role of Mary Shelley and the titular character at the end.

The prologue presents a glaring issue since Mary conveys this sequel to Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley not long after the success of “Frankenstein,” which was published in 1818. Since the film obviously contains fashions & technology of the early 1930s mixed with elements of the 1800s (which the director described as an “alternate universe”), Mary would have to be predicting what it would be like in the distant future, at least 1899 (which is the tomb’s date on a recently deceased woman in the story).

This is one of those rare occasions where the sequel is better. It’s marked by increased camp (but not overkill), the monster’s memorable friendship with a blind man in the forest, and the fact that he learns to speak in a monosyllabic fashion (which Karloff objected to). It’s an iconic addition to the Frankenstein story, a Gothic horror tragedy highlighted by unforgettable renditions of the monster and his “bride.”

The B&W movie runs 1 hour, 15 minutes, and was shot entirely in the studio at Universal Studios in Greater Los Angeles.

Yes indeed, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell are back to shake some action with this remake of their own The Evil Dead (1981), only this time with more money and more overt humour. A quick prologue sets things up nicely, then BAM! Ash (Campbell) and his squeeze are in the cabin of doom and about to be part of a night of unholy demonic terror.

It's a nightmare of the black comedy kind, where Raimi and Campbell invite us to a party and then gleefully pummel us into submission - and we sado-masochistically enjoy it! Ash has grown a pair of cojones and decides to fight back against the demonic forces, cue mucho action with chainsaw and shotgun. There's a quip on the tongue for our hero as well, even as he is battered from pillar to post to make the action work.

Raimi isn't interested in extraneous scenes or exposition, he strips it bare as the pic hurtles along, all while he brings his technical skills with camera and sound design to the fore. The humour is often outrageous, dementedly so, while it's nice to find a group of film makers who don't feel the need to now throw blood and guts at the screen every other scene just to make a formulaic impact.

765,Wuchak,"RELEASED IN 1987 and written & directed by Sam Raimi, “The Evil Dead” chronicles events when two Michigan State students (Bruce Campbell & Denise Bixler) travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. The daughter of the archeologist who made the tape (Sarah Berry) also visits the cabin with her beau (Richard Domeier) and a couple of dubious locals (Dan Hicks & Kassie Wesley DePaiva).  

The first film was low-budget, cartoony and extreme, but it was serious horror. This sequel is also cartoony and extreme, but it’s decidedly comedy horror. It’s entertaining for what it is, but it’s hindered by a confusing opening “recap” that doesn’t match the previous film. Raimi stated that he didn’t have the rights to use material from the original movie so he did a 7-minute recap with only two people instead of five (with Denise Bixler taking over the role of Linda). But there are other inconsistencies: The Book of the Dead and audiotape is found in a room rather than the basement and Ash (Campbell) later “rediscovers” that the bridge is out, which he already knew via events in the first film. 

Once you get past the awkward and perplexing set-up, the movie settles into an entertaining over-the-top gory horror comedy, which is so creative it’s as if it was made by a lunatic. Bixler is a great replacement in the role of Linda, but her part is too brief and you only catch glimpses of her stunning beauty. It took me a while to warm up to Annie (Berry), but I eventually did and she’s a worthy secondary protagonist. There are several amusing and thrilling sequences, like the demonic hand scenes.

But what attracted me to this film was the charisma of the lead actor Ash, played by Bruce Campbell. He is not a great actor by any stretch, but he does have a rather boyish charm that moves the film along, even if the script is as creaky as the rocking chair in his cabin!

Definitely made on a shoestring budget, and the sfx (no cgi here!) are not all that great, but it doesn't matter because you're just there for the ride; and to be fair there are some very good fx splashed around throughout, and the first person camera-eye of the Evil Spirit in the Wood, is also well done.

The direction from Raimi is very present once again with fantastically creative shots and quick zooms that are such a staple of his. The story is way more fleshed out here, with interesting flash backs that give the original an entirely new perspective. The special effects are better than the original, and we get to see a lot more of what the evil entity is. But with all the positives this movie has, it is just missing something that I cannot put my finger on. The original felt so genuine, and I think the low budget helped increase the tension and horror of the possessions. Here the tone is a little campier and I just don't resonant with it as much as the original.

When watching this film, I got the serious impression that “Army of Darkness” ended up being a kind of sequel or spin-off to this work, considering the themes involved and the persistence of the main actor, Bruce Campbell. Both films have similarities, and it's hard not to think about it.

Sam Raimi is one of those directors who have made a name for himself in horror cinema, but I can't help but think that this is one of his poorest works. “Evil Dead” is dark, it's bizarre, it's full of gore and scenes that make you want to throw up your popcorn, but it's not the kind of film I would watch again. With a miserably low budget and a lot of creativity, the director manages to disgust us more than to scare us, and there is little in this film that can really instill fear or dramatic tension. In fact, there are scenes that dangerously border on comedy.

Bruce Campbell does what he can, and what he does is enough to guarantee protagonism due to the absolute lack of a capable and competent cast. The actor is not completely devoid of ability or talent, but he seems to have limited himself to this, and similar films. It goes without saying that the rest of the cast doesn't even deserve a mention in this review, as they are absolute amateurs or people who made mistakes in their profession. And of course the Necronomicon, a book created by the fantasy imagination of H. P. Lovecraft, has a relevant role in the plot and is absolutely fearsome. In the midst of this funny disaster, what saves this film a little is the way Raimi takes the opportunity to study cheap visual and special effects, and the results he can get from them.

948,Cat Ellington,"Once upon a time, during a long ago (but certainly not forgotten) era, a horror film's radio trailer would feature the chilling voice-over of a male commentator, whom, after presenting a teaser synopsis for the slasher film's plot (over intimations of both sound and speech from the movie of course), would conclude the radio spot with the following words: 'Coming soon to a theater near you.' And, 'Rated R. Under 17 not admitted without a parent.'

Those classic horror film radio trailers used to scare the weebie-jeebies out of me! But boy, did I love them wholeheartedly.

(Pondering ... in remembrance)

Where John Carpenter's independent cult opus ""Halloween"" is concerned, the radio trailer had been no less terrifying. In fact, it made my blood run ice cold. . .

Though Halloween, one of my most beloved horror films in cinematic history, debuted (theatrically) in 1978, it would not be until October of 1980 that my family and I would spend our ""Movie Date Night"" at what had been a gorgeous movie theater in Gurnee, IL., buying hot dogs, Raisinettes, popcorn, and drinks from its state-of-the-art concession areas, and bracing ourselves for the terror which we were about to watch on one of the theater's humongous screens. Even from that time, I had cover and poster love: Book covers, album covers, and yes, movie posters. It was the artwork. Cover and poster art has always fascinated me. And upon seeing the poster art for Halloween, I fell smitten. For it had been one of the most unique movie posters that I'd ever seen at that time ... And I never forgot it. The artwork, featuring a man's hand wrapped around the handle of a butcher's knife, its pointed tip shown to be in alignment with the face of a Jack O' Lantern, was some of the most creative - not to mention original - movie poster art that my eyes had ever beheld at that time. To this day, it STILL reverberates. I can remember my reaction to it so well, what just standing in that beautiful lobby and staring at the poster for Halloween as it hung in its frame on the movie house wall. Too good. Too good.

'The Night He Came Home!' ...

If there is one horror film antagonist who has left a permanent emboss of the word ""terror"" on my psyche, it's Michael Myers. From the moment Halloween opened on the screen, fear came along to take up its abode within my entire being. The score, titled ""Halloween Theme"", which is also the (Main Title), was so eerily distinctive that the entire theater audience fell into silence - every patron hanging on to every piercing chord of it ... Perhaps me, especially, considering my own gift of music. The incredible John Carpenter not only directed and co-wrote (with Debra Hill) the screenplay for Halloween, but he also composed the entire soundtrack. . .himself. Carp is a badass for sure!

Moving on. . .

Set in the fictive town of Haddonfield, IL., this legendary cult film opens to a crowd of children out trick-or-treating on Halloween night. And these candy revelers include a six-year-old boy named Michael, whose choice of costume is a clown suit with a mask. All is well; a seemingly fun-filled All Hollows' Eve night ... Until Michael returns home from his evening of candy collecting, walks, almost mechanically, into his family's kitchen, selects a butcher's knife from the cutlery set, waits until his older sister's boyfriend (who's just finished having sexual relations with her) leaves, then walks, mechanically, upstairs to that same sister's bedroom - catching her unawares. When she turns around (still naked after her sexual escapade) to address him as her younger brother, Michael begins to take his turn penetrating her. . .with the sharp point of the knife. And he doesn't stop his blade puncturing until his sister collapses. He then walks back downstairs and goes out in the front yard to wait. Their parents soon return home to find Michael just standing outside - his face still covered by his mask - with the bloodied knife in his young hand. One of his parents lifts the mask, and we get our first glimpse at the six-year-old face of Michael Myers. The year was 1963.

That was just the opening.

It would be fifteen years later (in 1978) before the now 21-year-old Michael, escaped from the Smith's Grove Sanitarium, could return to Haddonfield for the purpose of laying claim on his former childhood home: Sitting unsold since the time he murdered his sister, ended up at Smith's Grove as the result of it, and succumbed to the abandonment of his parents. When Michael Myers returned to Haddonfield, all Hell broke loose ... Literally.

A phenomenally directed cinematic ouvre, Halloween stars Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, the teenaged protagonist who becomes the hunted of Michael Myers; Donald Pleasence, who portrays Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis; Brian Andrews, who was cast to play Tommy Doyle; and Nancy Loomis as Annie Brackett, one of Laurie's two best friends, respectively.

Shot on a $325,000.00 budget, Halloween would go on to earn over $71 million worldwide ... For a reason.

A soulless killer, Michael Myers, escapes from the asylum and returns to the Illinois town where he murdered his sister 15 years earlier to wreak havoc on Halloween night. Donald Pleasence is on hand as Myers’ seriously concerned doctor.

John Carpenter’s “Halloween” (1978) is hailed as the progenitor and blueprint for the slasher craze of the 80s with staples like the unstoppable masked killer, fake scares, the final girl and the undead dead. Of course, “Halloween” was influenced by earlier slashers or quasi-slashers, like “Psycho” (1960), “Dementia 13” (1963), “A Bay of Blood” (1971) “Torso (1973), “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974) and “Black Christmas” (1974). “Friday the 13th” (1980) and its sequels took the “Halloween” template and added other elements, like the summer camp setting and a devolving supernatural killer.

Whilst I prefer the “Friday” films, “Halloween” has more class than many slashers that followed, like the unimaginatively blunt “The Slumber Party Massacre” (1982). It also keeps the proceedings deadly serious unlike ones that added humor and campiness, such as “Friday the 13th Part 3” (1982). The film establishes some quality atmosphere with the raining sanitarium escape and the Halloween night sequences. The creepy ambiance is helped by the moody score composed and performed by Carpenter.

Although the story takes place in a fictional Illinois town, the film was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena and Hollywood, etc.), which is okay since the neighborhood scenes could be Anytown, USA. What’s NOT okay is how the trees clearly reveal that it’s not late October.

Other problems include a tedious lack of drive and some weak dialogue, like the girls’ conversation walking home from school, which doesn’t ring true. Speaking of the girls, they’re decent, but not nearly as good as the “Friday” films. Nancy Kyes (Loomis) is arguably the best as Annie, followed by Jamie Lee Curtis as the main protagonist (whose mother, Janet, starred in “Psycho”). Flighty, but likable PJ Soles is also on hand. Another dubious part is the doctor hiding in the bushes by the abandoned Myers’ abode speaking portentously.

I appreciate “Halloween” because it’s classy, atmospheric and it’s a flick pick for the fall season; it also holds an eminent place in horror history. But, in light of the above flaws, it’s a tad overrated by gushing fans.

The pace and tension build really well - helped by some good use of sound and light (I didn't much care for the over-synthesised score), the supporting screams from PJ Soles and Nancy Kyes and the occasional intervention from Pleasence. The sequels never reached the heights of this, original psychological horror - there are precious few special effect to laugh at or even speak of, really - and if you get a chance to catch up with it as intended on 35mm then you should certainly give it a go.",2023-06-04T17:56:15.686Z,7.0,Halloween,1978
948,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A competent film, with a killer who doesn't seem that ferocious when we read what's in the daily newspapers.**

Well, before writing a review of this film I have to make a declaration of interest that I think is appropriate: I absolutely hate Halloween, it's one of the days of the year that I can't stand. It's not a festival that belongs to my culture, it's completely foreign to the Portuguese tradition, and a poor excuse for stray teenagers to go to strangers' houses, at inappropriate hours, to bother those who are calmly in their own business. I've already had to expel a group with some rudeness and I have no doubt that, one day, I'll still have problems because of this stupidity. Furthermore, for Catholics, the feast day is the following day, November 1st, when the Church celebrates All Saints.

In any case, it's a good time to watch horror films on TV, and yesterday I happened to watch the film that brings me here today. Directed by John Carpenter, a director who became an icon of classic horror cinema, the low-budget film became a success, raised a real fortune and, over time, became a slasher classic, a type of horror that I confess I don't particularly appreciate.

Carpenter directs with his renowned skill and does an excellent job of creating and shaping suspense and atmospheric tension. The director made judicious use of lighting and cinematography, and the visual and sound effects have a truly intelligent and pragmatic effect. The sets are convincing, as are the costumes, and the soundtrack is atmospheric and iconic. Even those who have never seen the film will easily recognize the soundtrack associated with it. Unfortunately, I don't think the film works that well in terms of pacing: the first half isn't strictly interesting, there are many scenes that don't seem to be of much interest to me and that only serve to stretch the overall length of the film.

Although Michael is the indestructible villain and the central character of the entire plot, it is not a challenging role that deserves an accredited actor. Hiding behind a mask, he is a villain who doesn't need good actors, he just needs to seem unbeatable. Jamie Lee Curtis thus ends up being the main actress in the cast, making young Laurie a minimally credible teenager who doesn't just scream and run away hysterically whenever she can, even though she does so often. Donald Pleasance was less lucky: the actor is competent, but the character is a hysterical doctor who seems to believe that his escaped patient is a kind of Antichrist. The histrionic reaction is not received seriously by the authorities, and rightly so, but the actor is good enough to make the character somewhat solid.

The big problem with this film is the script: Michael tried to kill his sister in a very cold way when he was six years old. He was unsuccessful, but he was still locked up in a mental institution for a decade, and the doctor began to consider him Evil incarnate? Let's face it, this doesn't convince anyone. Just a few days ago, we saw a man who killed eighteen people in Maine and committed suicide. If he were alive right now, wouldn't he be more fearsome than Michael Myers? The Vampire of Düsseldorf, Peter Kürten carried out sixty-eight crimes and raped, mutilated and killed more than a dozen teenage girls, with extreme cruelty. Wouldn’t it be much more credible as “Evil”? Honestly, the story of this film falls far short of what we see in the newspapers.",2023-11-01T17:21:01.443Z,5.0,Halloween,1978

It is one of the most important films during the last 20 years and one of the powerful movie that left an impact on American cinema. The film talks about a hysterical, insane, murderous character who herself is a character who realizes from within that she is a murderer and describes herself with important dialogue sentences that talk about the nature of the character in the voice of the hero himself.

Patrick Bateman was a thug who wanted to convey his suffering to others, and he did not see that no one had a future. He did not show any good feelings to anyone, because his suffering wanted to convey it to everyone around him, while he was without emotion and did not desire anything but hatred and hatred for everyone. It was these sentences at the beginning and end of the movie that were a complete description of the character.

The director wanted to show the viewers the nature of Wall Street work and who works inside it in the old periods of this time, and all their concern and only goal was appearances and pretending with suits, glasses and cards that they made for themselves.

A week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.

Directed by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean cliché where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.

But in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.

> ""Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.""

This is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.

In the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level.

There are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.

I have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme. Recommended!

396535,Kamurai,"Fantastic watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend for those looking for a new zombie movie to watch.

This one really had me yelling at the screen: I was heavily invested....until I was basically emotionally exhausted.  I don't think I reacted quite how the director wanted me to react during that last act.

This is a fascinating premise.  A zombie outbreak that leaks onto a train (with just one infected), and these are ""World War Z"" running, 15 seconds to turn (usually) zombies.  I'm staunchly against running zombies, but when you do something well, it is really hard to discredit you for it.

There is one aspect that is truly odd for zombies, but it would be quite the spoiler, it's basically the 3rd act (out of 4).  The writing structure feels very different, it doesn't seem to adhere to a 3 act staple: it really feels like 4 acts broken into chapters (or levels similar to a video game) and as whichever characters survive the transfer from chapter to chapter, the story progresses.  There is clearly though pre-infection establishing act, post infection establishing act, confrontation act, and resolution act.  Once you get past the first act, it's pretty much non-stop action, by the by.

The one frustrating part about this movie is that most of the characters seem to have a death wish: despite trying to stay alive, they all seem to want to die.  I understand that a story can't happen without flawed characters, but the things these people do are so remarkably stupid sometimes that the zombies become more believable at times.  It does allow for some of the more amazing scenes though, so it might be somewhat forgiveable.

This movie is honestly so good, I really feel like I'm reaching on any of the complaints.",2020-07-27T02:13:55.618Z,9.0,Train to Busan,2016

Zombie apocalypse is far from being a groundbreaking subgenre. The Walking Dead franchise is arguably the most popular show on Earth when it comes to portraying this supernatural future. World War Z and the Zombieland duology play that role in the movies' realm. However, all of these works fail to reach the always high expectations that come with a story set in a time like this. When people ask, ""what's the best zombie apocalypse film ever?"", one doesn't have a clear answer simply because there isn't an outstanding, mind-blowing, near-perfect flick. Well, at least not until 2016, the year of release of the best movie in the genre, Train to Busan.

I genuinely feel sorry for everyone who refuses to watch foreign films for whatever reason. A different language and/or the display of subtitles shouldn't be enough to convince viewers to ignore so many unique works from all around the world. If someone dares to call themselves a ""zombies fan"" and has not watched Train to Busan yet, then ""fan"" is far from being the right description. This is South Korean cinema at its best. Everyone is 200% committed to their role, whether that is a stunt man or one of the protagonists. Yeon Sang-ho delivers a powerfully suspenseful, intense, epic, and most of all, heartbreaking story with the help of a phenomenal screenplay written by Park Joo-suk.

When the only ""negative"" aspect that I can find is related to ""maybe not-that-logical"" specific actions performed by some characters, I know that I'm nitpicking a near-perfect movie. I struggle to find a single real issue with the entire film. In my opinion, the reason why the latter works so well is largely due to Park Joo-suk's script. Usually, people always think about the zombies first: how do they look? How do they act? Do they run wildly or stroll? Which new attributes or skills do these zombies have different from what we've seen until now? How did it all begin? Is there a cure? Granted, the zombies look cool, and Yeon Sang-ho is able to create impressive action sequences filled with maximum intensity and extreme tension. Entertainment-wise: top-notch.

However, the action only works as well as it does due to the emotional bond that the viewer shares with the (non-infected) human characters. These are beautifully treated and developed in such a remarkable manner. There are easily five to six characters that the viewer ends up caring deeply about. Typically, at least half of this group is expendable in this type of film because some characters show no signs of intelligence or are just douchebags. In Train to Busan, every single character possesses likable traits, besides being directly connected to each other (father-daughter, young couple pregnant). The action scenes are filmed in incredible fashion, but it's the encompassing emotional aura that ultimately elevates them.

It's really an emotionally devastating story. The viewer is placed in dozens of situations that require the hardest of choices from the main characters. The generic dilemma ""do I save the person I care about or everyone else?"" is taken to a whole other level with exceptional dialogues, filled with an excruciating amount of suspense, leaving me about to tear up on more than just a couple of times. Every character has a terrific, compelling arc. The main protagonist, Seok-woo (Gong Yoo), goes from being a despicable character, one that I wouldn't mind seeing killed in the first fifteen to twenty minutes, to a lovable father that only wants what's best for her daughter, protecting her at all costs during the apocalypse.

This movie is packed with clever social commentary, relatable to this day (and even more during the current global pandemic). Yon-suk (Kim Eui-sung) represents everything that's wrong with our society. A selfish man who thinks he's more important than everyone else due to his class and whose job is more significant than his own family or friends, let alone strangers on a train. He also works as a ""wake-up call"" to our protagonist, as a ""what if"" version of Seok-woo's future if he continues to only focus on his job. Another character of great relevance is Sang-hwa (Ma Dong-seok), a father-to-be who ends up protecting Seok-woo's daughter when her father can't. His bravery and selflessness make him an instant audience favorite.

Technically, it's genuinely a flawless film. From the outstanding zombie makeup to the mind-blowing stunt work, everything action-related serves as evidence to prove that South Korean cinema does action a thousand times better than conventional Hollywood. The level of intensity is ridiculous. Lee Hyung-deok's camera work is absolutely brilliant, moving through the train seamlessly, letting the viewer see and understand everything. Aided by excellent editing (Yang Jin-mo) and a phenomenal score (Jang Young-gyu), Yeon Sang-ho generates tension and suspense in a way that makes every single action sequence feel overwhelming, powerful, and even epic.

A runtime close to the two-hour mark that flies by. The first act perfectly sets up the apocalypse to come with a surprisingly subtle build-up of the exponentially growing chaos. Then, the outbreak in the train which occupies most of the movie's duration. During this period, everything happens. From the nail-biting action sequences to the emotionally powerful moments of character decisions that make this film so shocking. Finally, a third act that left me floored, completely drained of emotions, not knowing exactly how to feel after it all ended. Despite a couple of sequences that I believe were exclusively executed in the way they were to offer an emotionally climactic moment, everything else feels impressively realistic.

All in all, Train to Busan is arguably the best zombie apocalypse movie of all-time, at least, until the date of this review. The subgenre finds in Yeon Sang-ho's mind-blowing flick the masterpiece it deserves. From the exceptionally subtle build-up to the emotionally devastating final act, passing through the most vivid, suspenseful, tense depiction of a zombie outbreak ever put to screen, Park Joo-suk's screenplay is the reason why this film succeeds so well. A heartbreaking story featuring astonishingly well-developed characters, surrounded by a powerfully resonant social commentary, even more in the current days. Action-wise, it's South Korean cinema at its best: maximum intensity, phenomenal camera work, seamless editing, chill-inducing score, outstanding commitment from everyone involved, and a fantastic stunt team. Hollywood should learn from movies like this. I can't find a single flaw. It left me emotionally drained. If you're a fan of cinema, no matter the genre, this *must* be on your watchlist!

An eccentric scientist living in a warehouse laboratory in a big city in the Northeast (Jeff Goldblum) discovers how to teleport objects, which draws the attention of a journalist (Geena Davis). Everything is going fine until he foolishly uses his invention on himself and a pesky fly inadvertently teleports with him. John Getz is on hand as the woman’s editor while Joy Boushel has a notable small role as Tawny. 

""The Fly"" (1986) has a lot of devotees presumably because of director/writer David Cronenberg, but I found it less effective compared to the 1958 version with Vincent Price. Despite the gory state-of-the-art effects, it’s just not as compelling or horrifying (especially that final scene in the original). The one-dimensional locations are also a turn-off: Excluding the great bar scene the whole movie takes place in a grungy lab or a swank office building.

The cast trilogy is exceptionally tall. While Goldblum (6’4½”) is serviceable and gives it his all, he’s not leading man material, although he’s fine in secondary roles. And I was never big on Davis, but she’s a’right I guess. At least the two absolutely look & act like they were meant for each other.   

In its favor, the movie is a metaphor for how aging & disease slowly destroys the body. Despite the sickening visuals, it’s heartbreaking and tragic, which you might not expect in a sci-fi flick about a guy who morphs into a fly. It thankfully avoids the rut of camp and melodrama.

The film runs 1 hour, 36 minutes, and was shot in Toronto with studio work done in nearby Kleinburg.

I haven't seen Zombieland in quite a few years, but with its sequel being released this week, now it's the perfect moment to go back to the hilarious world of zombies. It still holds up incredibly well. In a time where zombie films and TV shows were starting to come up (The Walking Dead premiered one year later), this post-apocalyptic zombie comedy flick still remains as one of the best zombie movies of the century. Their use quickly became something cliche, and neither funny or scary. Nowadays, people are used to seeing the living dead on the screen all the time, so why does a 2009's film like this still work?

Well, first of all, the outstanding cast is halfway through success. In 2009, only Woody Harrelson was already a renowned adult actor. Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg didn't star in anything truly remarkable yet, so much that Abigail Breslin was more recognizable than them. Even with only 13-years-old, she already had an Oscar nomination in a supporting role (Little Miss Sunshine). However, everyone delivers fantastic performances, which carry the simplistic yet entertaining story to such a success that it became a zombie classic.

Harrelson portraying Tallahassee, the guy who's not scared of anything and likes to ""enjoy the little things"", is one of his career's coolest roles. Eisenberg is not exactly the type of actor I like since he can only do so much with his acting abilities. He always offers the same type of character: a quirky, twitch-full, idiosyncratic personality, which most of the times doesn't work. Contrary to this tendency, Columbus is a character that logically and hilariously fits this model, hence Eisenberg is the movie's primary source of comedy. From his list of rules to his weird behavior, everything feels natural since the character's background justifies his awkward self.

Stone and Breslin share great moments together, as well as Harrelson and Eisenberg, but the former duo has less exciting sequences. Nevertheless, even though the girls could have received more character development, their relationship gives them a compelling reason for us to care about. Wichita might just look like the cliche hot girl who falls for the good guy, but she would do anything to protect her sister, and her love for Little Rock does give her some gravitas. The cast's chemistry is undeniably astonishing. It's visually palpable that they had tons of fun doing this film, and that elevates every single conversation or action scene.

The short runtime allows for a fast-paced story, packed with fun moments, and a lot of bloody zombie killings. The production design is remarkable. Excellent use of practical effects and real sets, plus a perfect soundtrack. Ruben Fleischer knew precisely what he wanted the movie to be, and he never tried to make it something more. Yes, it still involves a romance of sorts, and some backstories might not be funny or joyful. However, it never feels forced or fabricated. It never overextends its stay because Zombieland is neither a romance or a drama. It's purposefully campy, plays with stereotypes creatively, and it's merely 88 minutes of good fun. We are in 2019, and studios forgot how to make films like this!

Every year, there are dozens of blockbusters that would be extremely entertaining if studios would just let them be what they are meant to, but no. They need to have some relevant story that carries a political tone or a social message. Zombieland has all the attributes of a pure blockbuster: a phenomenal cast, a straightforward narrative packed with thrilling sequences, a short runtime with fast pacing, compelling characters, and thousands of zombies. Put together a funny screenplay filled with chuckle-worthy jokes, and you have yourself one of the best zombie movies of the century. It's one of those films which don't exactly have what people address as ""flaws"". Zombieland has its cliches and lazy exposition, but it heavily compensates them with 80 minutes or so of spectacular entertainment. It's a zombie cult classic.

19908,The Movie Mob,"**Zombieland is a hilarious treat for comedy and zombie fans alike.**

Zombieland is a goofy spin on the hordes of zombie movies that came as a result of The Walking Dead’s popularity. It follows a zany cast of characters with big personalities thrust into a post-apocalyptic landscape. However, rather than living in constant fear and survival, it feels as if the characters consider it all another Tuesday. Their motivations are finding twinkies or love rather than escaping death. This tonal twist leads to a very entertaining, self-aware plot that takes funny jabs at traditional zombie tropes. The cast nails this tone as well, with Harrelson, Eisenberg, and Stone all delivering sarcastic yet genuine and caring performances.",2022-08-27T02:06:08.662Z,8.0,Zombieland,2009
19908,CinemaSerf,"Jesse Eisenberg does his best Charlton Heston impersonation as ostensibly the last man left on the planet amongst an army of pathologically fed up zombies. His initial narration gives us a little clue as to how he has survived, unbitten, for this long - and just how dangerous it is to use the toilet - before he encounters ""Tallahassee"" (Woody Harrelson) on what's left of the freeway. Convinced they are both still human, they join forces and go off in search of ""Twinkies"" (that's the food variety and not young gay guys!) They find a grocery store where they are quick to rescue ""Wichita"" (Emma Stone) and her twelve year old sister ""Little Rock"" (Abigail Breslin) only to quickly discover that it's now them that needs the rescuing. Some cat and mouse antics now ensue between what is now the last four remaining people, before things settle down for an an hour of comically inspired adventures that sees them seek safety - in the Beverly Hills mansion of Bill Murray for a while, before a denouement in funfair that sees a battle royal commence that's only really missing Ennio Morricone. The four characters here all gel well and with Harrelson on a form that reminded me of why he became famous in ""Cheers"" in the first place, Eisenberg and Stone developing their rapport and the young Breslin looking on with a degree of sagely amusement, this is a fun film. It's well written with plenty of pithy one-liners and plenty of homages to other films and actors who've tackled the zombie theme over the years too. It's nice and short so we've no extended and repetitive combat scenes to bore us, just some short and sweet slaughtering using just about every piece of kit you can imagine (even a food mixer!).",2024-10-05T06:53:05.809Z,7.0,Zombieland,2009
571,John Chard,"Birds of a different feather do indeed flock together.  

The Birds is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted to screenplay by Evan Hunter from the story of the same name written by Daphne du Maurier. It stars Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy, Veronica Cartwright and Ethel Griffies. Cinematography is by Robert Burks and editing by George Tomasini.

Mother's love? Better to be ditched or loved?

When animals attack! The only outright horror movie that Alfred Hitchcock ever directed, The Birds sees the great man get the utmost terror from something so amiable in our lives - Birds! Modern day critics can hark on about it being dated all they like, it still doesn't detract from what a frenzied experience ""The Birds"" can still be - let alone what it did for cinema goers in 1963! Admittedly upon small screen ventures too much is missed or under enhanced, which is a crying shame.

But it isn't dark Annie! It's a full moon.

Plotting is simple in trajectory terms. Hip socialite Melanie Daniels (Hedren) has a friendly vocal joust in a pet shop with handsome Mitch Brenner (Taylor), the result of which sees Melanie, on a mischievous whim, buy a couple of lovebirds and set off for Mitch's weekend retreat out in Bodega Bay to deliver them as a show of devilish womanhood. Upon arrival in Bodega Bay, though, Melanie seems to be the spark for the birds in the area to start attacking humans, and pretty soon the attacks escalate and intensify...

Hitchcock and Hunter offer up no reasons or answers for what occurs in Bodega Bay (to keep it murky we learn late on via radio that other towns become affected), and famously the ending is open ended as well, forcing the audience to unravel ideas themselves. There's no musical score in the film, thus Hitchcock gets the terror and tension out of editing, bird effects and unholy sounds. The pacing is also a key area, it's a good hour before things go decidedly nasty, the wait keeps the viewer on edge, we seriously get to know the principal characters (the actors worked well by Hitch) and then the terror is unleashed. Perfect.

Hitchcock's skill at staging a memorable scene is well evident here. The climbing frame that sees one crow arrive, cutaway as Melanie smokes on a bench, back to the frame and now it's four crows, cutaway, back, and five crows – eight – then a ""murder of crows"". The birds first attack at the birthday party, the telephone kiosk, gas station mayhem, the birds swooping into view above the school roof and the POV viewpoint as we join a bird hovering above a town under siege, all great scenes, as is the crowning glory that is the eerie silence that accompanies the edge of your seat finale.

Motifs are plentiful, from Mothers to sexuality, from broken crockery - to glass - to abandonment fears, Hitch has fun, especially with the human interactions, or lack of in certain scenes. It's a film that cries out for analysis, such is the director's want, in turn it's a riveting horror picture and a crafty enigma. It sounded daft as a basic idea for a film, and some must have thought Hitchcock had missed the boat of the creature feature boom of the 50s. Yet ""The Birds"" stands tall and proud as a damn fine piece of film from a true maestro of his craft, one of his last true classics and still today, over 50 years after its release, the film provokes theory discussion and visual terror in equal measure. 9/10",2018-12-09T13:59:24.972Z,8.0,The Birds,1963

63311,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**The film is good: it's tense, it's intense, it's shocking, it's dramatic, it's engaging... but it's also brutal and quite illogical if we think about the details.**

As far as I remember, this was the first Pedro Almodóvar film I saw, and it was up to my expectations. I heard that he was a very visual director, that he wasn't afraid to show ugly things as they are, with realism and authenticity, and that he sometimes brought us complicated, ambitious stories. This movie is all of those. Honestly, even though it's not a kind of cinema that I particularly like (and I don't think I'm the only one who sometimes feels uncomfortable when realism and rawness are taken to the limit), I liked what I saw. However, there are several flaws, mainly in the story told. I'll talk about that later.

To make this film, Almodóvar called a very competent cast of Spanish actors, and it is really necessary for us to recognize that Spanish cinema is going through a very good phase, with a lot of quality and very talented people. Although we are used to seeing him making American films, Antonio Banderas is Spanish, and it's great to see him here, speaking in his mother tongue. He knows how to give his character a darkly restrained, cold, calculating and slightly psychotic look. Elena Anaya also leaves us with a very satisfactory work, even considering that she doesn't have the material and time for more. Jan Cornet and Marisa Paredes, in a frankly secondary position, provide adequate support to their colleagues.

On a technical level, the film also has some interesting points. Filmed mostly in the Galician region, a short distance from Portugal, it is not a tourist postcard, we are barely able to recognize the locations (I didn't). But this is secondary! The locations are good and well used, the sets are very good (especially the operating room, with all the medical apparatus and a very modern look) and the cinematography is really remarkable. Cleverly edited, it's well paced and time passes without we're noticing.

The screenplay is inspired by written material, but has been so overhauled by the director that it doesn't have much connection with the original source. It's something new, even if we can understand or guess where the inspiration for some details came from. We follow the saga of a surgeon, specializing in plastic and reconstructive surgery, to create synthetic skin that he can apply to burned or injured people. Of course, this stems from trauma – he lost his wife in a burning car, and more recently lost a daughter, who committed suicide. What happens is that, at a certain point, he starts to make increasingly morally questionable experiments, going so far as to kidnap a person. I don't want to say too much, the film has many twists and turns that make the script more complicated than usual, but I won't be being honest if I don't say that there are many details and twists that have no logic at all. They simply do not make sense, starting with the creation of synthetic skin: the reconstruction of a burned face is a medical problem that is still far from being solved, but everyone knows that the skin is a human organ that regenerates itself, under the conditions and right time. It may never be the same as it was. And I can't see how all of this is connected with any hypothetical sex change (I won't say more, watch the film... but knowing that it's a very grotesque story, so get the kids and grandparents out of the room).",2023-05-27T06:53:45.150Z,6.0,The Skin I Live In,2011
63311,CinemaSerf,"After losing his wife in a fire, accomplished surgeon ""Ledgard"" (Antonio Banderas) has been working for many years on a type of skin that can resists burns! After about a dozen of them, he might be on the cusp of a breakthrough - but just how has he managed to develop this groundbreaking fabric? We, watching, are not the only people suspicious and as his fellow scientists become more openly sceptical, we begin to discover a little more of just what he's been doing for all of these years and that's the kind of plot twist that really does make you cross your legs! This is another of those stories from Almodóvar that is really quite disturbing - but not in any kind of hysterical fashion; it's an almost perfect paced and increasingly menacing story that is gradually back-filled to powerful effect by an on-form Banderas who juggles obsession and neurosis compellingly. There's not a great slew of dialogue, just enough to keep the thing enthralling and I really did enjoy the last fifteen minutes.

1933,Wuchak,"Spectral happenings on an estate in the Channel Islands after WWII (no spoilers)

RELEASED IN 2001 and written & directed by Alejandro Amenábar, ""The Others"" is a haunted house flick about a woman (Nicole Kidman) who lives in an old manor on one of the Channel Islands with her two photosensitive children immediately after WWII. After three people arrive seeking employment, they increasingly become convinced that the abode is haunted.

While this is a fantasy movie in that it depicts supernatural happenings, like doors mysteriously opening and closing, these types of unexplainable things have been known to happen. The movie is a serious exploration of what may really be occurring. The mansion seems sterile and there’s a one-dimensional pale ‘look’ to the bulk of the picture, which was intentional for obvious reasons. Speaking of which, the perpetually fog-laden grounds create a nice ghostly ambiance.

Everything hinges on whether the last act effectively reveals the truth and it does. The film provides intriguing food for thought.               

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Cantabria, Spain (exteriors of the mansion); Penshurst, Kent, England (The Lime Walk) and Madrid.

1933,CinemaSerf,"""Grace"" (Nicole Kidman) lives in her almost blacked-out stately pile on Jersey where her two children ""Nicholas"" (James Bentley) and ""Anne"" (Alakina Mann) are hyper-sensitive to light. When her staff mysteriously abscond, she has to employ a new housekeeper ""Mrs. Mills"" (Fionnula Flanagan), and together they must ensure that the children are always locked into a room with no access to any windows that are not shrouded by thick curtains. The suddenly she hears a noise. Maybe a voice, even? She searches in vain but these odd occurrences start to multiply. Their usually fastidious household routines start to unwind, doors are left unlocked and the children start telling their mother of people moving around the house - folks that she cannot see! Just what's going on? Are these happenings connected with ""Mills"" and the new staff? Great news when husband ""Charles"" (Christopher Eccleston) returns from the War - shellshocked and distant, or then again - does he actually return at all? ""Grace"" is becoming increasingly paranoid. She can't tell what's real and what's not - and her children are only fuelling her fears! Although way darker and more sinister, this actually reminded me a little of the ""Amazing Mr. Blunden""! A ghostly story that uses children as a conduit between what might have been, or is, or may yet to be. The young Bentley and Mann deliver effectively here as director Alejandro Amenábar uses the dark and creaky house, extensive and frequently misty grounds and a creative sound effects mixer to create a genuine sense of menace. It's very hard to be innovate with this genre, there's just so much we have all seen before, but Kidman paces herself well here delivering a story that's not so predictable as we might have expected.",2024-04-25T08:08:47.193Z,7.0,The Others,2001
246741,Reno,"> The video document of the life of the vampires.

A documentary style horror comedy based on the short film of the same name by the same directors. I would say it is an interview with the vampires in the Kiwi style. The film follows a group of vampires living in an old mansion and their everyday routine, including how they manage to get blood and confrontation with other mutants are documented.

Definitely a wonderful comedy, but feels like a mix of 'Dark Shadows' and 'Addams Family'. The title implies the nightlife of these creatures, especially adapting the modern way of lifestyle. So their exploration begins here for their video document. Being different is how much struggle is what the film focused. Threats from various quarters and getting over from every disastrous event is revealed.

Quite an interesting vampire film with the awesome characters and of course the entire film was shot in the dark time. It is not a cliché, but just a spoof of the typical vampire theme. Cleverly written screenplay and direction with the well supported performances. Looks like many people had loved it, I'm slightly on the different side that I enjoyed watching it but did not like much. Because I have seen better film in the similar concept. So I still recommend it because it is worth a watch.

The directorial style is very similar to the hit TV show 'The Office' as it is able to create humour in the realism and personal interviews and monologues. This method also allows it to be genuinely scary at times such as when we meet the housemate inspired by 'Nosferatu'. The extreme and realistic gore also comes across as very brutal and juxtaposes the silly gags.

31417,John Chard,"How odd I should have to comfort you. You still have some hope, at least.

Les yeux sans visage (AKA: Eyes Without a Face) is directed by Georges Franju and collectively written by Franju, Jean Redon, Pierre Boileau, Thomas Narcejac and Claude Sautet. It stars Pierre Brasseur, Edith Scob, Alida Valli, Juliette Mayniel and Francois Guerin. Music is by Maurice Jarre and cinematography by Eugen Schufftan.

Dr. Genessier (Brasseur) is wracked with guilt over the car accident he caused that saw his beloved daughter Christiane (Scob) suffer horrendous facial injuries. He has a notion to perform xenograft surgeries on female victims and transplant the face onto that of Christiane…

It sounds like a classic mad scientist movie, the sort where Peter Lorre stalks around the place with a devilish grin on his face, only the French version! Eyes Without a Face isn’t that sort of horror film, haunting? Yes, but there is no killing for joy or sadism here, it’s done for love, to assuage guilt whilst advancing science. Oh it’s still madness, but there’s a real sadness to Dr. Genessier’s actions, touchingly so, and with Franju a master of hauntingly lyrical splendour, it’s a film as beautiful as it is troubling.

Christiane is a living doll, a slow moving angel forced to wear a porcelain mask to hide her badly burned face. As she glides around the Gothic halls of the Genessier house – and the lower tier corridors of the hospital that’s annexed to the house -  Franju never wastes a chance to poeticise a scene, using slow and long takes in silence that imbue the story with a sense of the foreboding. Even when there is dialogue, it’s always in hushed tones unless it involves the police, who are naturally suspicious of the good doctor Genessier. 

A number of evocative scenes are truly arresting, gorgeous in construction and meaning, none more so than the very final scene that closes the pic down. But the most talked about scene is the one of horror, the surgery procedure that we actually see, a magnificent breath holding sequence, gruesome but once again, done in the name of love! The tragedy of which is palpable. From the opening of the film as Louise (Dr. Genessier’s assistant played by Valli) drags a dead body to a lake, to a moving sequence as Christiane visits the caged dogs that serve as guinea pigs for her father’s experiments, the blend of horror with fairytale like sadness is beautifully rendered.

Tech credits are very high. Schufftan’s photography is graceful and sombre, whilst Jarre’s musical score, particularly the macabre carnival tune he uses, is coming straight from the aural chambers of the surreal. Brasseur is terrific as Genessier, again playing a doctor (he was wonderful the year before in Head Against the Wall), Genessier is a tortured soul with ice cold blood running through his veins, and Brasseur nails it. The French Laird Cregar? Yes. That’s a justifiable compliment. In truth all performances are high in quality, with props to Scob who has to wear the immobile mask and act just with her sad puppy dog eyes.

As the doves fly, this is what it sounds like when dogs – and a porcelain angel – cry. Indeed. 9/10",2014-03-12T00:46:53.723Z,9.0,Eyes Without a Face,1960

He will stop at nothing - quite literally - and the coup de grâce is still something that makes me shudder, even now. Not for the squeamish, nor is it gratuitous.

There's a snow storm blowing ferociously, a man trundles towards a signpost that reads Iping. He enters a hostelry called The Lions Head, the patrons of the bar fall silent for the man is bound in bandages. He tells, not asks, the landlady; ""I want a room with a fire"". This man is Dr. Jack Griffin, soon to wreak havoc and be known as The Invisible Man.

One of the leading lights of the Universal Monster collection of films that terrified and enthralled audiences back in the day. Directed by genre master James Whale, The Invisible Man is a slick fusion of dark humour, berserker science and genuine evil. Quite a feat for a film released in 1933, even more so when one samples the effects used in the piece. Effects that are still today holding up so well they put to shame some of the toy like expensive tricks used by the modern wave of film makers. John P. Fulton take a bow sir.

After Boris Karloff had turned down the chance to play the good doctor gone crazy, on account of the role calling for voice work throughout the film only, except a snippet at the finale, so Whale turned to Claude Rains. Small in stature but silky in voice, Rains clearly sensed an opportunity to launch himself into Hollywood. It may well be, with Whale's expert guidance of course, that he owes his whole career to that 30 second appearance of his face at the end of the film? As was his want, Whale filled out the support cast with odd ball eccentrics that are acted adroitly by the British & Irish thespians. Una O'Connor, Forrester Harvey, Edward E. Clive and Henry Travers are memorable. While American Gloria Stuart as the power insane Griffin's love interest is radiant with what little she has to do. 

Based on the now famous story written by H.G. Wells, Whale and R. C. Sheriff's (writer) version remains the definitive Invisible Man adaptation. There's some changes such as the time it is set, and Griffin is not the lunatic he is in the film, which is something that Wells was not too pleased about in spite of liking the film as a whole, but it's still very tight to the source. Sequels, TV series and other modern day adaptations would follow it, but none are as shrewd or as chilling as Whale's daddy is. 9/10",2018-09-26T19:09:09.393Z,9.0,The Invisible Man,1933
10787,tmdb28039023,"We all know that necessity is the mother of invention, but there is another saying in Spanish that roughly translates to ‘sloth/laziness is the mother of all vices’ (the closest English equivalent I can think of is ‘idle hands are the devil’s playground’). I would say that the link between invention and laziness is largely computer-generated; that’s why a near-100 year-old movie such as The Invisible Man looks better than any modern CGI extravaganza, and it does so because it’s all there – even when it isn’t.

Jorge Luis Borges once wrote about all the trouble that H.G. Wells’s Invisible Man has to go to (wigs, dark glasses, fake noses and beards, etc.) so that people can’t see that they can’t see him. Director James Whale went to similar great lengths to make sure we can see that there is someone we can’t see, and the sheer mechanical ingenuity devoted to making the titular character a tangible physical presence reminds me of the biblical admonition that “ye shall know them by their fruits”; Dr. Jack Griffin (Claude Rains) certainly puts the phrase ‘conspicuous by his absence’ in an entirely different perspective.

The flawlessness of the whole enterprise is made even more impressive when we consider that it was achieved with wires that had to be kept out of the shot because the technology to digitally delete them obviously didn’t exist yet. Other optical effects, involving the Invisible Man himself as opposed to his interactions with other people and objects, are less convincing, and at the same time aren’t – that is to say, any less convincing than today’s green screens, motion capture, and other assorted VFX.

The other major factor that sells the film is Rains’s performance. He evidently can’t emote (we only see his face until the very last shot, and even then in the stillness of death), but he more than makes up for that, first with body language – a category wherein I feel compelled to include the sight of Griffin’s (as Borges might say) autonomous pants skipping down a country road –, and later with his disembodied voice, which he contorts to fully convey the extent of the character’s madness.",2022-08-28T02:36:39.790Z,6.0,The Invisible Man,1933

“The Invisible Man” (1933) was based HG Wells’ 1897 novel, just moving the events to the early 1930s. It surprisingly holds up for succinct cinematic entertainment. The first half is more interesting than the second, however, as the latter focuses on how the authorities can apprehend the unseen criminal.

Peeping Tom is directed by Michael Powell and written by Leo Marks. It stars Carl Boehm, Moira Shearer, Anna Massey, Maxine Audley and Brenda Bruce. Music is by Brian Easdale and cinematography by Otto Heller.

A famous (infamous) film for a number of reasons, not least that the fall out from its release effectively finished the career of the great Michael Powell. Interestingly now, still some 50 plus years later, there are still people discovering the film for the first time and not being sure what they have just watched; much like many critics back in 1960 as it happens! While horror seekers quite often come away disappointed that they haven’t seen a Jack the Ripper bloodshed movie. Apparently they see the words serial killer and expect gore and terror on tap.

As fans of the film will attest, Peeping Tom isn’t that sort of serial killer film, it’s a fascinating piece of work. A cunningly crafted observation of a darkened mind, of voyeurism, loneliness and child abuse. From the opening strains of Easdale’s skin itching piano the mood is set, then the brilliantly lurid colour scheme comes into play as troubled Mark Lewis (Boehm) hones in on a victim, a lady of the night about to be filmed in the throes of death. It’s the start of Powell and Marks’ ploy to make us complicit in Lewis’ actions, and then the makers challenge us to sympathise with him as his back story is revealed and also as he struggles with his affections for Helen Stephens (Massey) in the present day.

There is also a sly aside to the movie industry running through the picture, something which no doubt irked critics and film distributors back in 1960. There could maybe be an argument that the trauma and psychological thematics at work that underpin the plot are a little dated now? But what is still relevant is the film making – voyeurism angle as we today are constantly fed reality TV for entertainment purpose. The production is across the board grade “A”, the performances highly effective, with the unfairly maligned Boehm perfect as Lewis, the actor even providing shadings of Peter Lorre at times. Heller’s bold colour photography is disgustingly atmospheric, Easdale’s music a stalking menace and the sound department really come up trumps. Perfect.

Then of course there is Powell himself, deeply hurt by the savaging he received when Tom was released, it’s nice to note that before he passed away in 1990 he would see the film become a highly regarded piece of film making. It and he deserves praise, his direction is conceptually daring, his framing of Lewis methodical, and of course his camera is our eyes and ears, uncomfortably so.

There's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that ""haunt"" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.

Forget the ""based on a true story"" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means ""this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit"". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.

Story essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.

There is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.

The script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.

Met with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10

138843,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"The Conjuring is a fairly classical horror/haunted house/exorcism movie. That was pretty much what I was hoping for. Slow and creepy build up to a final outburst and confrontation with an evil entity. This is a good movie although it is not really something new in terms of story. It is fairly impossible not to think about, and make comparisons with, The Amityville Horror when seeing this movie. I do not think it really deserves the glowing 9 or 10 star ratings that I have seen but it certainly do not merit those 1 or 2 star ones either. What were these people expecting?

This is a solid effort of making a movie along the classical lines of supernatural possession. As I wrote, it is not really something new, but it is nice to see a new movie using this kind of story without just turning it into a CGI gore-feast. Sure, the movie also includes the traditional pitfalls that most horror movies apparently must have like people thinking it is a good idea to walk down into the dark and scary basement all alone in the middle of the night.

One thing that irked me with the movie though was the idea of phantoms and performing exorcism being presented as kind of normal and accepted things. Of the movie would have played itself out 70 or so years earlier maybe but in the 1970′s? It just felt somewhat surreal to see this “ghosthunter” make presentations and talk to people like supernatural entities and the practice of exorcism was just things that happened.

The we have the ending of course. Not that it was overly bad but christ, if you are going to do an exorcism then do it damn it. Do not stop the procedure and look lost every time something goes bump.

Anyway, I was not sure whether I was going to be disappointed or pleased when sitting down to watch this movie. On the whole I was pleased. It was a nice to watch a movie that was going back to the traditional values in horror movie making and it was as well implemented as one could expect.",2014-06-17T06:09:33.754Z,7.0,The Conjuring,2013

138843,CinemaSerf,"""Ed Warren"" (Patrick Wilson) and his wife ""Lorraine"" (Vera Farmiga) are renowned paranormal investigators drafted in by the at-their-wits-end ""Perron"" family to their remote Rhode Island farmhouse that they are convinced is possessed. It doesn't take them long to realise that this whole area has been the scene of Satanic worship since time immemorial, and those lingering spirits have got it in for the new occupants of the house - and their five increasingly hysterical daughters. James Wan really does develop this story with an effective degree of menace and Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor work well together as the parents scared out of their pants by the goings-on in their dream home that is turning into a nightmare that perhaps even an exorcism won't resolve. Joseph Bishara presents us with an eerily effective musical accompaniment to this story and the acrobatic and prosthetic visual effects all contribute effectively to create a real sense of malevolence that, unusually for many in this genre - it has a degree of plausibility too.

138843,r96sk,"<em>'The Conjuring'</em> is an extremely solid supernatural horror. I admit that I did find it less interesting as it went on, but even so I did comfortably enjoy seeing the progression of the story; I like that the plot doesn't majorly meander, each stage is clear.

It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares either, which is something I was expecting it to utilise. The supernatural elements here are very well done, we don't see terribly much of the demons, at least early on, so any appearances are effective. The stuff with the kids/mum is convincing too.

I was happy to see Vera Farmiga appear onscreen, I remember her fondly from 2011's <em>'Source Code'</em> and have wanted to see her in lead roles since - she's excellent in this. Patrick Wilson and Lili Taylor are also notable performers, while Joey King has one particularly great scene.

I'd class this as more creepy than scary, admittedly I seldom find movies scary (just the way my brain is wired with fiction). I can obviously still sense when something is unsettling though, anything with kids being possessed does the job in that regard.

How this franchise has ten features and I hadn't even seen one is a mystery to me. Better late than never, hopefully this strong first entry is a sign of things to come.",2025-01-26T01:12:16.547Z,8.0,The Conjuring,2013

So let’s First get this out of The way I’ve never been more frustrated, by people eating popcorn, fidgeting, & Coming in late. 

Anyways form the very start I had so many questions, how’d they get here? Where’d the Monster come from? Etc. And by the end I have no answers and even more questions. Are they gonna survive and kill all the Monsters? Is everyone else dead? Why’d they think to have a baby? But that doesn’t matter.

We’re just tossed into this situation with no explanation to almost anything. The only things we really know is of course making lond sounds means you’re likely gonna die. And High Pitch Sounds Hurts the Monster. 

Wish is a smart Choice and come to think of it is kinda obvious, maybe a little too obvious. Like how’d they never think about that? Either way. 

A quick note for surviving other then the soundproofing here and there. Why not have a sound bomb of sorts, you could just throw? That would have toldy saved the Dad from having to sacrifice him self. 

That isn’t to say they’re stupid they had many Smart decisions such a The sand paths, the box for the baby (wish was kinda sad), the little sound proof room, the Radio, and the fireworks. And that’s just the sound related stuff the Lights and Fires Where also Smart.

Otherwise the cast give us some incredible performances and lots of good chemistry. It probably helps that John and Emily are a real couple. Speaking of wich John Krasinski has Written and Directed a very clever and suspenseful horror film. I’ve never been more scared of corn in my life. Also had jumped at water. 

And the sound department specifically the Foley Artist have never shined greater in any film I have ever seen before. The sound is a way flipped from most horror films as it’s when the music drops and everything goes quiet that the Monster attacks. But not in this case everytime the Monster comes it’s a big moment.

Although I have nothing against a R rating. In fact I’m somethimes more likely to see a film because of a R rating, it shows they have gus and they are willing to take a risk. F*ck you MPAA!!! 

Anyways some times all kinds of unnecessary crap is put in a Film because they like oh yeah we’re rated R. Although that’s not always needed this Film proves a well done PG-13 can still be dark and brutal. Killing a Child with in the first 10ish minuets, is a little dark. Although come on that kid had it Coming as soon as he grab those batteries. there’s almost a bit of blood maybe the MPAA is pulling back on some things. Probably not those F*ck you MPAA!!!

Ok sorry my review is getting to become rated R. 😆

Also I wanted to note for whatever reason I enjoy films where I can count the entire cast.

Along side Get Out it seems people form comedy make better Horror film Directors then most Horror film Directors. It definitely makes sense though it’s all about that timing.


In Short It was a gripping film from start to finish. I’d highly recommend to all Horror and Thriller Fans. Although because of spoilers in this review you probably already saw it.

In a **dystopic future**, the humanity has been severely smitten by strange blind creatures that feast on living flesh, both human and animal. In spite of being blind, the creatures have a super hearing and can identify sounds from far away. The creatures are nearly indestructible and very effective killers, and once they hear you, you are most likely dead.

The movie follows a surviving family trying to keep alive in this harsh reality. The movie setup is incredibly well-built to transpire the precaution, the constant fear, and the direful consequences of an unthought action in this terrible future. **The sound effects are awesome**, and the director can successfully use the nearly-constant silence in contrast to the hassle of being followed by those creatures.

The **acting is solid** and helps to immerse the watcher in the well-built plot.

My only regret for this movie is that it ends during a climax, when we are not ready to stop watching it yet. **It could be 30 minutes longer** to explain some missing points and to show what happens after the ending.

Overall, **an awesome movie**, well-thought and beautifully produced in every aspect.",2018-05-09T03:08:58.988Z,8.0,A Quiet Place,2018

I do believe that maybe _A Quiet Place_ doesn't **quite** deserve the praise that it has received. Not that it isn't a good movie, just that said acclaims have been **so** high, to the point that I think maybe just the fact that it's original isn't enough to earn those laurels.

447332,LadyGreenEyes,"This is far and away one of the best movies I have ever watched, and I've watched a lot of movies!  The story is original, no  small feat these days, and the acting is just outstanding!  John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, along with the children, bring these characters to life, and make us really care, all without the benefit of well written dialogue.  That's not easy to do, but they do it.  Right from the start, you find yourself drawn into the lives of these people, and can feel the tension, the undercurrent of threat, that they live with every day.  Through all they face, we are also given a picture of a solid family, with a dad and mom doing everything possible to care for their children, the family praying together, holding onto faith even under the most difficult of circumstances, and that family dynamic really strengthens the entire story.  Who do you rely on when all is changed?  When everything goes wrong?  Family.  Along with the acting, the direction, sets, just everything, come together to deliver a truly scary movie, that doesn't rely on flash to terrify you.  Highly recommend this one.  We saw it in the theater, and bought it as soon as it hit the stores.  Top notch work.",2018-12-16T01:54:38.117Z,10.0,A Quiet Place,2018

447332,Wuchak,"_**Decent horror flick, but the family members make too many exasperating blunders**_

A family tries to survive on their farm in rural New York while blind indestructible creatures prowl the landscape. The creatures find prey based on sound so they have to be careful to be quiet at all times. Emily Blunt plays the pregnant mother and John Krasinski her husband (Krasinski also directs).  

“A Quiet Place” (2018) is a well-made horror flick that brings to mind “Signs” (2002) with ferocious creatures that mix the xenomorphs of “Alien/Aliens” with the extraterrestrials of “War of the Worlds” (2005). They’re basically a knock-off of the monster in “Cloverfield” (2008), albeit the smaller size of the creatures in those previous flicks.

While this movie gets a lot of praise in some circles, the constant mistakes of the family members gets frustrating and tiresome. I love the tone, however, as well as Emily Blunt and the sumptuous Hudson River-area locations.     

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in the state of New York, about 50-65 miles north of the Big Apple (Beacon, Pawling & New Paltz), except for Little Falls, which is another 110 miles northwest.

Ever since Jordan Peele shocked everyone with his feature directorial debut, Get Out, no one else questioned the potential that a well-known comedic actor could bring to the horror genre. Therefore, I vividly remember discovering that John Krasinski was directing, writing, and starring in a low-budget, original horror flick and feeling incredibly interested, to the point of considering it one of my most anticipated movies of the respective year. I absolutely adore the actor's memorable performance in The Office, but I never really saw anything worth noting from him after that show. Adding Emily Blunt (Sicario, Edge of Tomorrow) - her ""slightly more famous"" wife - was definitely an attention-grabbing move, especially when the young actors were still unknown at the time of release.

With the help of Bryan Woods and Scott Beck, Krasinski developed a screenplay based on a relatively simple yet highly impactful, imaginative premise. Creepy, scary monsters who hunt by sound isn't exactly a mind-blowing story aspect, but the extreme amount of tension and suspense transform a regular theater session into a nail-biting, nerve-wracking cinematic experience. Fortunately, the audience at my first screening was really invested in the film, which made for a truly unforgettable moment that I know some people didn't have due to disrespectful moviegoers. However, if there's one thing no one can take away from A Quiet Place is that it works just as well or better watching at home with the lights out in the silence of our own house.

Some viewers might look at this movie solely as an entertaining horror film with effective jumpscares, shock value, and cool monsters, which are all great attributes. However, the reason why everything works so well is indisputably due to the profoundly well-explored family. Thematically, parenthood and family love are subjects that Krasinski and his team of writers deeply expand upon, primarily through the father-daughter relationship. Being a parent is seen by many as a daunting task, filled with the inevitable fear of not being considered a good father or mother. Lee and Regan's (Millicent Simmonds) difficulties in understanding each other are not only remarkably relatable, but their bond also contributes to some of the most emotional scenes of the movie.

Lee and Evelyn only desire to keep their children safe, but when the world is packed with merciless creatures that kill if a pin drops, some details like having a deaf daughter certainly don't help their mission. They do, however, dial up the levels of tension and suspense to their maximum. Krasinski shows tremendous skill as the director by delivering excruciatingly suspenseful build-ups and exceptionally effective scares. His ability to drastically change the entire mood of a scene offers the viewers several genuinely captivating sequences. Horror-wise, there's plenty to enjoy. From creative atmospheric sequences to jaw-dropping, shocking plot points, A Quiet Place has something for everyone.

I've addressed Krasinski's work as both director and writer, but he also offers what I believe to be his career-best performance in a feature film. Both he and Emily Blunt perfectly capture the terrifying feeling of living in a post-apocalyptic environment. The protection of their children carries overwhelming despair of losing them to the visually distinct monsters, and both actors shine in their roles. However, my personal standout is Simmonds (Wonderstruck) and Noah Jupe (Honey Boy, Ford v Ferrari). Both were unknown young actors at the original release date, but they steal the spotlight from the big stars. Jupe proves that he has everything to become an Oscar-winner - the demand for him is exponentially rising - and Simmonds delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen from a real-life deaf actress, bringing a great deal of authenticity to her display.

All incorporate their characters seamlessly. The interactions between the adult and young actors feel as realistic and honest as possible, also due to the beautifully written screenplay. Technically, I must praise the phenomenal work done with such a low budget. All the way from the shooting location to the sound department, it truly feels like every single person had an essential role in the making of this movie. Not even the monsters are at fault, and there are a couple of close-ups that could have easily been awful, but the VFX artists really step up to the plate and deliver wonderfully horrific creatures. It's well-edited (Christopher Tellefsen), well-shot (Charlotte Bruus Christensen), and the score (Marco Beltrami) is employed just at the right moments.

I only have one major issue with the film. Story-wise, even though the audience is placed in a fictional world, it feels so real that it's hard to ignore a couple of logical questions regarding the fate of the rest of humanity. These nitpicks don't really bother me, but the ending of the movie still doesn't sit well with me after many viewings. Without spoiling it, of course, the very last shot feels like a cry to Hollywood to make a sequel, which I have to admit is somewhat disappointing. Finally, a film that doesn't belong to cinematic universes or titanic franchises focuses on telling an engaging story with characters worth investing our time on… all to end in a slightly out-of-character moment so more movies can be made?

A Quiet Place remains emotionally impactful, as well as incredibly suspenseful and tense, even after multiple viewings. Boasting a concept so unique yet so simple, John Krasinski and his fellow co-writers create a profoundly well-explored, character-driven horror story packed with relatable family issues and impressive performances across the board. Through justified shock value and surprisingly investing non-verbal dialogues, this film is one more piece of evidence that the best horror emerges from remarkable character building. The popular actor also proves to be a phenomenal director, generating extreme suspense quickly, drastically altering the entire atmosphere of a scene seamlessly. Technically, it genuinely feels like a low-budget flick where every single department has a noticeable impact on the final product, but the menacing, distinct-looking CGI monsters do steal the spotlight. Despite a few logical issues and an ending that feels more corporate than indie, my love for this movie continues intact. Hopefully, its sequel won't be a disappointment.

Almost an 8/10 on a different, shabbier, online movie database with almost 14 hundred reviews at the point of this review written. The hype is distorting the ratings of this movie, like the script is distorting the physical laws of sound. A creature film should not be hard to make, and the producers here had the budget, the special effects and the actors to do something interesting. Unfortunately suspending disbelief is impossible when nothing makes sense and so many questions are left unanswered. How can a pitiful monster like that overthrow mankind? Where is the power coming from? Not a single sound trap in the whole film? Did she turn off the faucet eventually? The creatures can come and go inside the shelter without breaking anything down (which you would hear)? But the humans did not prepare silent exits in their home? What even happened? And there is no story. The creatures come, humans make some sounds, they don't even fight, end of movie. It's like watching a boxing match with one guy weighing double the other, then last round the same guy weighs only half the other. How cheap and boring, I want to scream the screenwriter in his moronic ear. Disappointing and anti-climatic.

I will start with the positives that I have, as in fairness there are a number. The first, most obvious, being the sound design - excellent! Super effective. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski are very good, the pacing is on point (the 90mins fly by) and the monsters are well done.

However, I did find myself questioning a lot of it - and I'm not usually one to notice, or at least criticise, characters being stupid etc. Here, though, it's too obvious - I think the top notch sound, or the lack thereof, actually heightens the flaws, which is unfortunate. From the very start I was like ""Really?!"", as well as at a few other moments - e.g. the nail.

Firstly with the kid, like rule number one at primary school on field trips is adult at the front, then the kids and then another adult... who leaves the two most vulnerable people at the back in this situation, especially seconds after one of them has almost made a grave error - not even counting the fact that you just walk out the store and leave them alone after the event? Stuff like that, it's annoying that it took me out of it every now and then, I can't lie.

As noted though, it is still a fun watch and I'm certainly wanting to check out the sequel. I just don't think I've ever had a film that I enjoy but has such noticeable stupidness, the latter usually outweighs the former - or vice versa.

170,John Chard,"It started off as rioting. But right from the beginning you knew this was different...

28 Days Later is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland. It stars Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Megan Burns, Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Ecclestone. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.

When animal liberation activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Center, they come across a scientist who tells them that to release these chimps would be insane. They have been injected with a test serum known as ""Rage"", and it's highly contagious and spreads easily and quickly. Ignoring the warnings, one of the activists opens a cage and is attacked and bitten by a chimp and rage quickly spreads among the group...

28 days later... 

The amazing thing with Danny Boyles's 28 Days later is that although it owes a huge debt to the likes of George Romero's zombie films, and John Wyndham and Richard Matheson's writings, it still feels fresh and exciting. Film is quintessentially British, as evidenced by the rightly lauded use of a depopulated London for the starting point to the terror, yet there's an earthiness to our small band of survivors. These are flawed characters that are ill equipped to deal with the infected implosion, there's nothing remotely Hollywood about these people or the landscapes that frame them (CG is minimal, where hand-held digital cameras are the order of the day). 

There's a realistic feel factor that is rarely seen in other films of this ilk. Yep, sure there's implausibilities, but with the infected creatures running at a fair old clip, becoming scary creations in a stark stripped back land, there's too much fun being had - and nervous tension being burnt - to even begin to start nit-picking. Besides, the last quarter alone is a lesson in energy fuelled horror as the survivors, having seemingly found a safe house, find that monsters aren't merely confined to the infected human kind. It's a cracker-jack of a finale, bloody and bloody frantic, all backed by Murphy's simple but totally potent musical arrangements.

It's easy to see why America made it a monster hit at the box office, after just making a small profit in the UK, film went to America and made it big. Americans, you have to feel, enjoyed watching something raw in a sub-genre of horror that was at the time reliant on Romero rediscovering his mojo. Worldwide the film made over $70 million in profit, and those are the kinds of figures that speak volumes. The success ensured a sequel would follow, where Boyle and Garland bowed out of the main chairs and into producers roles for ""28 Weeks Later"". It's not as raw as ""Days"", but it's gorier and itself also a fine ""infected"" horror movie, and certainly a worthy follow up to what Boyle and Garland clinically created in 2002.

The film's opening sequence is one of the most iconic and powerful in horror movie history. Jim wakes up in a hospital room to find the world he knew has disappeared, and the eerily deserted streets of London make for an unsettling and ominous backdrop.

The film is expertly paced, with a gradual buildup of tension that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The infected humans are terrifying, fast-moving, and relentlessly violent, and the film's use of sound and lighting only heightens their impact.

One of the standout features of ""28 Days Later"" is the excellent acting by Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris. Murphy delivers a convincing performance as Jim, a man struggling to survive in a world gone mad, while Harris shines as Selena, a tough survivor who has learned to navigate the dangers of the new world.

The film's themes of survival, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit are powerful and thought-provoking. As Jim and Selena make their way through the deserted streets of London, they encounter a range of characters, each with their own story of survival and loss.

The film's cinematography and visual effects are also top-notch, with haunting and memorable shots of a deserted London and intense action sequences that will leave you breathless.

Overall, ""28 Days Later"" is a masterful horror movie that sets the bar high for the genre. The film's excellent acting, pacing, and visuals make for a truly unforgettable experience. I would rate ""28 Days Later"" a 8 out of 10.

170,CinemaSerf,"Despite being warned that a group of monkeys about to be released from a lab by some anti-vivisectionists are laced with disease, they let one of them out anyway and next thing it's a month later and ""Jim"" (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in hospital all by himself. There's not a soul to be seen, anywhere. He can't spend the entire film wandering about naked, so finds some scrubs and goes exploring - gradually gleaning information about the plague that led to the evacuation of the cities and to his current isolation. It's not as if he had anything to do with the release of this virus, but he now has to deal with it's consequences. Luckily he encounters ""Selena"" (Naomie Harris) and ""Mark"" (Noah Huntley) who save him from a marauding mob (think ""Omega Man"" from 1971) and their risky adventures begin trying to find what's left of humanity and hopefully safety. A wind-up radio broadcast gives them some hope, and off they travel with newfound friends ""Frank"" (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter ""Hannah"" (Megan Burns) in their black taxi (so of course, it takes a circuitous route) to Manchester. Their arrival visits tragedy on the small group but also introduces them to the last bastions of military security - under the command of ""Maj. West"" (Christopher Eccleston). Pretty swiftly they realise that very little of this new scenario is much safer for them and their thoughts turn to leaving...! This is quite an effective apocalyptic tale of corrupted science and morals and uses, for most of the first section of the film, dialogue sparingly allowing the eerie photography and soundtrack of a largely abandoned London to set the scene for us. Thereafter the writing isn't the best, but the benign sense of menace exuded by Eccleston and the confidence of both Harris and the young Burns work well at giving us an almost claustrophobic sense of peril, especially as we drift to a denouement that is cleverly constructed to make us think. It's bleak and threatening at times, not without the odd dark humour and in the end presents us with quite an intriguing look at humanity in many of it's less attractive, more visceral, guises. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland keep a few twists for the tale at the end, too, and Murphy holds it all together in an understatedly potent fashion.",2024-05-22T07:51:03.592Z,7.0,28 Days Later,2002

170,r96sk,"<em>'28 Days Later'</em> is ace! As someone who adores <em>'The Walking Dead'</em>, this was always going to be something to enjoy; it does play out like a TWD storyline, hitting every beat that you'd see in that show - only a good thing. How about that cast list, by the way?

Cillian Murphy. Naomie Harris. Brendan Gleeson. Christopher Eccleston. All of them play their part, obviously Murphy is the main man but Harris and Gleeson are very good in their respective roles. The direction of Eccleston's character is blatant, but nevertheless entertaining.

The visuals are the most impressive element away from those aforementioned, particularly the locational stuff across London; even more so when reading about how they did it behind the scenes.

628,CinemaSerf,"This is a much more sophisticated take on the vampire through-the-ages narrative; but it has certainly dated in the almost 30 tears since Neil Jordan put together a stellar, if not great, cast to regale us with the tale of ""Louis"" (Brad Pitt) & ""Lestat"" (Tom Cruise). Told in flashback to a very sceptical reporter ""Daniel"" (Christian Slater), Pitt tells of his near 200 year life that started with his meeting with Cruise and his conversion to his immortal existence based on blood. It's a hugely lavish affair, with loads of lust, trickery, duplicity and gore - tinged with genuine regret, loneliness and sadness - and, of course, loads of cruel violence. Whilst it does nod to the whole ""Hammer"" style of horror thrillers - there is plenty of ketchup - the writing and characterisations have much more depth to them. Neither of the principal characters are likeable, but you do build some sort of reverse empathy with - at least Pitt - as the film progresses. The attention to detail on the sets and costumes as we march through time never lessens and contributes magnificently to a stylish, sumptuous glamour-fest. Much as they were/are doubtless box-office A listers, however, Pitt was just too young looking to be convincing, Cruise just can't really act at the best of times, much less with extra dental props and Kirsten Dunst just annoyed me in the best traditions of Shirley Temple.

I hadn't seen it for about ten years and as the full moon came beaming through my apartment window late last night, it just felt right to indulge in some Proyas Gothic excellence. 

The question still taps away at all our doors, namely would the film be the cult classic it became without the Brandon Lee tragedy? That's a tricky one to answer because we all deep down have a morbid curiosity about us, especially with films and their stars. This is why I got a lot more from re-watching the movie after a very long period of time, namely that it may have drew many of us in years ago because of the tragedy and heart aching back story to writer James O'Barr's birthing of Eric Draven the character, but it can now enthral, thrill and shatter emotions of its own accord. 

The Gothic art design and the soundtrack are emo personified before such a label was invented, Lee is lithe and skilful and serving notice to what a talent we were robbed of that fateful day in March 1993. The villains are a roll call of go to guys for such roles, Kelly, Wincott, Todd, while Ernie Hudson fronts up as good cop personified. And finally Proyas, struggling with the budget even before Brandon's death, that he manages to create this world of perpetual bleakness, but still offer hope and beauty - the latter via tracking shots, pull aways and intricate frame shots of a tormented Draven, shows him to be a purveyor of considerable skills. 

All told, The Crow (1994) deserves to not be thought of as a cult classic, but just as a classic, period. 9.5/10 ",2015-02-04T18:45:37.561Z,9.5,The Crow,1994
9495,Gimly,"**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2011.**

In the vein of films like _The Punisher_ and _Mad Max_, _The Crow_ first hit my screen only four years ago, way back when my DVD collection consisted of only about 40 films, (now it is around 500). I had $10 to my name but I was intent on expanding the thing, a girl I'd met only that day, suggested I buy it from Sanity, when there used to be one in Civic. Since that day, when I was well and truly blown away by it, we've always intended to make our tradition of ""Crow and Coffee"" (wherein you watch _The Crow_ and drink several litres of Ice Coffee & Bailey's) a repeated thing.

I feel as if this one should have been known to me for far longer than it has. It's quite a point of shame in the Goth community to have none been raised on the shit. And I can tell why. The film blends some of the most incredible bands out (The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Violent Femmes, Pantera), is filled with great actors, it's based on one of the best comics I've ever had the good fortune of reading, and it's overshadowed by the death of the actor playing lead protagonist Eric Draven, Brandon Lee, son of martial arts master Bruce Lee.

_The Crow_ is filled with the dark and ominous. Towards the end, Draven fights using a martial arts move that was performed in honour of Brandon Lee's father, Bruce Lee, when he used an identical style in _Enter the Dragon_, the last film his father ever starred in, before his untimely death. In another scene, Draven can be seen filling a gun-barrel up with metal, and shooting them out into a pawn shop, Brandon Lee was killed on set during filming, when a metal casing became lodged in a gun that was then expelled by a blank, fatally wounding Lee in the torso. Behind the scenes, on the first day of shooting a carpenter suffered sever burns on set after his crane hit power lines. Later, a grip truck caught fire, an angry sculpting employee crashed his car through the set's plaster shop and another member of the crew accidentally impaled his own hand with a screwdriver. According to the biography of Bruce Lee, Brandon's death was predicted by his father after awakening from a coma, he foresaw Brandon's death long before he had even considered taking up acting, supposedly.

By no accounts is _The Crow_ unpredictable, it's rather the opposite, but it makes up for this in so many ways! It notches up some of the best quotes in film history, as well as being badass, and yet so utterly convincingly emotional. There is essentially no demographic I can think of that wouldn't enjoy (at least a little) this dark film's gothic atmosphere, gritty hopelessness, world-changing special effects, riveting action, and well-deserved cult status.

9495,CinemaSerf,"Well if you though it was wet on ""Blade Runner"" (1982) then welcome to a ruined city where the torrential rain never seems to stop. A series of flashbacks tells us that two graves hold the bodies of a young couple about to be married. That's before local kingpin ""Top Dollar"" (Michael Wincott), who had designs on their building, sent his henchmen to ""coax"" them out. A year after this tragedy a crow alights on the grave of ""Eric"" (Brandon Lee) and enlivens his corpse so that he may avenge the brutality visited on his fiancée and himself. What now ensues is a dark and menacing revenge thriller that, though fairly predictable, sees this former rock musician develop some astonishingly lethal ninja skills as he identifies and then rather entertainingly despatches a variety of drug dealing undesirables whilst retaining a sense of the decent by befriending local cop ""Albrecht"" (Ernie Hudson) and re-connecting with the young ""Sarah"" (Rochelle Davis) whose mother is another of the addicts in this dismal and hopeless city. It's the enigmatic ""Myca"" (Bai Ling) who spots the Achilles heel of our hero and so sets a scene with her menacing beau as ""Eric"" hones in on the final stage of a challenge that will hopefully allow him to return to his own grave in peace. Lee is really is in his element here and Alex Proyas and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski use the grim, sodden and ruined environment to depict as physical a corruption as the story does a societal one. What dialogue there is is largely left to an engaging contribution from Hudson, who has his own mini axe to grind with his police colleagues who saw him busted from detective for trying to investigate the activities of ""Dollar"" before. When you watch this film, you can't help but think on the number of other characterisations it has spawned, and it shows how revenge horror can work without resorting to endless special effects and jump-scenes.

46838,ireviewfilms,"A bit of a breath of fresh air is this in a low budget and yet well produced comedy horror that gives Død Snø and the likes a run for their money. Tucker & Dale Vs Evil follows two redneck hillbillies- Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) who head into the woods in the Appellation Mountains so that they can drink some beers, do some fishing and fix up a worn down cabin to turn it into the holiday home of their dreams.

At the same time a group of preppy college kids are on a camping trip into the same woods also to have a good time. After a couple of run ins with the hillbillies, they assume that they must be your stereotypical inbred manic chainsaw wielding killers right out of Deliverance or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. So when one of the kids Allison (Katrina Bowden) is rescued from drowning by the hillbillies, prejudice and paranoia reign supreme with the others mistaking it as her being hauled away in a kidnapping attempt. So they embark on a mission to rescue her from her saviours with hilarious consequences.

Despite the premise of the movie being based on one long running joke of a massive misunderstanding, the story remains fresh and the scenes extremely funny for the majority. I'm not aware of any other movie that has done this type of role reversal with hillbillies in this type of scenario and managed to blend in the right amount of comedy with horror and gore. In fact across all the genres, it is not often that you get to see the perspective of the 'bad guys' (far from it in this film).

The best moments come from the writing as we follow the bickering between Tucker and Dale as a bromance emerges on screen. Both Tudyk (aka Steve the Pirate from Dodgeball) and Labine impress making the characters extremely likeable and charming so that by the end you really do care what happens to them. Bowden plays her part solidly as well and definitely brings some eye candy to the film!

Most of these types of films tend to lose their drama element but this keeps the anticipation and as I said, you end up really caring about what is going to happen to the characters. However, the only major fault that I can pick out is that despite all this, it does begin to fade as a spectacle in the last 15 minutes as they focus a bit too much on the back story and tying up loose ends when what they were doing up to that point was more than enough in my books.

It's usually hard to combine the right amount of comedy and horror without creating a somewhat tacky result so credit must go to the new guy on the block- director and co-writer Eli Craig. If you are looking for a unique comedy horror that has a chance of hitting cult status/settling in nicely behind Shaun of the Dead then you need look no further than this.

Tucker & Dale vs Evil is directed by Eli Craig who also co-writes the screenplay with Morgan Jurgenson. It stars Alan Tudyk, Tyler Labine, Katrina Bowden and Jesse Moss. Music is by Michael Shields and Andrew Kaiser and cinematography by David Geddes. Plot has Tudyk and Labine as two harmless mountain/country men who head to their newly acquired vacation home in the woods to fix it up and get some R & R. But after a misunderstanding at a roadside store with some college kids, who think Tucker & Dale are hillbilly psychopaths, the wheels are set in motion for a bloody battle for survival, but who for?!

In 1996 Scream came slashing forward to inject witty life into a fading horror genre, with freshness and inventive splinters from the slasher formula, Wes Craven's movie rocked the horror faithful's world. Tucker & Dale vs Evil will not have the same impact, its limited release and low budget worth ensured it never had a chance of being a big thing, but still it's the freshest horror/comedy to have come out since Scream made its bloody bow at the box office.

It's such a simple idea at the core, you have to wonder why it wasn't thought of before? Craig and Jurgenson have flipped the age old Hillbilly Killers vs Preppy College Kids idea on its head, and in the process smothered it gleefully with dark humour, laugh out loud moments and inventive deaths. There's also some social comedy nestled nicely in the narrative, big points about first impressions and ideas of stereotypes, and hell yes! There's even an opposites attract arc - though that admittedly helps to bog the picture down as the central joke premise runs out of steam towards the end. In fact were it not for a relatively sloppy finale, this would surely be falling into sub-genre classic status. Thankfully all that comes before it is so full of vim and vigour, blood and bluff and fun and frolics, it's not hard to forgive the debut director his one misstep.

The neat trick is having the film unfold from the Hillbillies viewpoint, where the carnage that unspools gets increasingly difficult for them to explain, this in spite of their innocence. Each death is logical to the college kids who go on the attack when one of their number, they think, is kidnapped. And it's logical to us the audience as well, were it not for us being privy to these wonderfully funny sequence of events, we too would have them hung, drawn and quartered after a guilty verdict was reached in 10 seconds. This is the ultimate horror/comedy flip-flop movie. So many funny sequences light up the picture, with a chainsaw scene one of the finest moments to have ever graced a horror comedy movie, but the dialogue, too, is not found wanting in the fun and charming department. Cast are on top form, with Tudyk & Labine a most agreeable double act, where their comedy timing is impeccable, and Bowden & Moss are more than just pretty faces.

Craig (Sally Field's son) has started with a bang, if he can top this then he is a name to really get excited about. If he can't top it? Well he will at least always have one of the best horror comedy movies on his CV. Yes it's that good, fans of Scream, Severance, Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland should seek it out post haste. 8.5/10",2019-06-19T06:06:31.053Z,9.0,Tucker and Dale vs Evil,2010

Mainland Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) flies off to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a 12 year old girl. What he finds is a culture steeped in Paganism, presided over by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee). Meeting static and indifference wherever he goes - and being driven to anger by the assault on his Christian beliefs - Howie is very much a man alone and most likely in grave danger? 

Directed by Robin Hardy and adapted to screen by Anthony Shaffer from David Pinner's novel, Ritual, The Wicker Man is very much a cult masterpiece. The back stories to it could make a film all by itself, be it censor baiting, studio cuts, body doubles or just plain offending religious groups, it's a film that is well worth looking into via the top range home format releases.

From the moment Howie (a truly brilliant Woodward) lands at Summerisle everything seems off, there's a sinister atmosphere pervading the story. He is met by unnerving imagery wherever he goes, songs and rituals gnawing away at his senses, there's even eroticism deftly placed within the film's master plan. He doesn't know what's going on, and neither do we, this is a mystery right? There is after all a missing child to be found, right? But once Lord Summerisle (Lee also terrific) enters proceedings and ups his game, things unravel in edgy fashion, building up to the justifiably famous and harrowing finale.

Some modern horror fans may baulk at the lack of bloody carnage et al, but this is classic horror. A horror film bulging with intelligence and pulsing away with literate smarts. 9/10",2016-07-10T21:50:16.522Z,10.0,The Wicker Man,1973
16307,CinemaSerf,"Well the cinema was packed as we all sat though what seemed like an interminable preamble of interviews with those connected with the film - including Britt Ekland - before it all started. Was it worth it? Well, I didn't really think so. Policeman ""Howie"" (Edward Woodward) arrives on a remote Scottish island after reports that a girl has gone missing. He is perplexed by the seemingly indifferent attitude of the locals who claim that she never existed or her mother who claims that she is six feet under in the graveyard. He becomes even more bemused by the general attitude of the villagers - led by their laird ""Lord Summerisle"" (Christopher Lee) and taught by their not quite ""Jean Brodie"" schoolteacher ""Miss Rose"" (Diane Cilento) to life in cereal, and to his presence in particular. Soon, his investigation starts to lead him a merry dance as he begins to suspect something way more sinister is afoot - and boy, is he correct. Thing is, though, can he find and save the missing girl and get to the bottom of this mystery. To be fair, it does offer us a more sophisticated, almost mythological, approach to an horror movie loaded with mysticism and pagan ritual. Indeed, I don't know that it fits well into that genre at all - it's more of a psychological thriller populated by a decent cast of household names. The thing for me is the story. I just found it all a bit weak; it takes far, far too long to build up anything like an head of steam and is really rather over-scored with music that is left do too much of the heavy lifting when it comes to generating the sparing senses of peril this film elicits. Perhaps it isn't fair to look upon it critically forty years later, when so many of our sensitivities have been eroded away, but I really couldn't figure out quite what all the fuss was about. It's now a cult film - and maybe that says it all? Worth a watch, but a television leaves nothing missing, I'd say.",2023-07-23T08:36:47.047Z,6.0,The Wicker Man,1973
16307,OuroborosSurfer,"Here Edward Woodward stars as Sgt. Howie, a Christian Scottish policeman sent to the remote island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. 

The horror of the Wicker Man is not the obvious kind that hits you in the face with a hammer, but quietly creeps up on you. The way the pagan villagers act indifferently or defensively to the supposed disappearance or murder of a child is disturbing, especially as everyone seems to be hiding something, including the girl's classmates.

One criticism of the various heavily cut versions of the film is that not quite enough time is given to that subtle process of building up the suspense and atmosphere of the film. The Director's Cut, however, is a small masterpiece. The central idea of this closed-off pagan community, generally peaceful but indulging in the rare bit of ritual of human sacrifice, is delicious. 

Woodward as Howie is on top acting form, as is the legendary Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle. Economical storytelling ratchets up suspense and mystery. Additionally, the film boasts one of the best and most fitting soundtracks I've ever heard, comprised mostly of in world folk songs rather than generic ""spooky"" music.

The ending of The Wicker Man must go down as one of the most shocking in cinema history. Since the film plays it relatively cool until that point, the payoff is all the more harrowingly believable. 

I also enjoyed the idea that, in terms of what may lie beyond death from the point of view of the characters, both Howie and the islanders get some kind of ""reward"" from the final ritual. The islanders get the reassurance that their crops will thrive in the coming year, while Howie gets his martyr's death and the expectation of a special place in heaven. The film made me think a lot about belief systems; who is to say paganism is less valid than any other system of religion? All religions are sustained by faith and passion rather than reason or evidence.

Thought-provoking, strangely beautiful, and just plain creepy, the restored version of The Wicker Man deserves its cult status. Even if you're not usually a fan of horror, you're likely to take something away from this burnt offering.

David Thewlis is a good actor, but in bit parts he always seems to phone it in and David Warner was just the more believable photographer.

794,CinemaSerf,"OK, so at times this is a bit far-fetched, even for a horror movie, but I reckon it is still my favourite from the genre made in the 1970s. From a rather murky start in a Roman hospital, we see Gregory Peck and wife Lee Remmick head to London where he is to be US Ambassador - along with their new baby son ""Damien"" (cue the squeaking violins). Not long after their arrival, their nanny commits suicide - rather gruesomely, as it happens - facilitating the arrival of ""Mrs. Baylock"" (a rather menacing Billie Whitelaw). As the boy ages, and fuelled by some rather ghastly prophesies by Patrick Troughton's ""Father Brennan"", Peck slowly concludes that there is something a little dodgy about him. Thing is, can he thwart the evil contained within the youngster? Richard Donner does well to build and to sustain a sense of peril from pretty much the outset of this film - aided, ably, by a Jerry Goldsmith score that uses maniacal choral vocals and strings to keep you behind the sofa. Peck isn't at his best, and some of the scenes - especially in the graveyard with the Baskervillian hounds - do stretch the imagination, but for the most part it seizes your attention and keeps it.

285923,Wuchak,"***Zombies, dancing skanks, rednecks and killer stunt cars***

“Grindhouse” (2007) features two separate movies: “Planet Terror” by Robert Rodriguez and “Death Proof” by Quentin Tarantino. Together, they’re called “Grindhouse” because they’re a deliberate attempt to recreate the experience of a double feature at a B movie house in the mid/late 60s-70s with the prints intentionally marred by scratches and blemishes or, in one case, a whole reel supposedly missing. Trailers for fake movies, like “Machete,” are also part of the package.

“Planet Terror” involves a biochemical outbreak in central Texas that (big surprise) turns people into zombies and the ragtag group that teams-up to fight ’em, led by Freddy Rodríguez and Michael Biehn, the latter a sheriff. Hotties Rose McGowan and Marley Shelton are on hand, the former acquiring a machine gun implant in replace of her amputated leg. (How exactly she pulls the trigger to massacre zombies is anyone’s guess).

The movie comes across as a melding of “Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!” (1965), “Night of the Living Dead” (1968) and “Dawn of the Dead” (1978), but with the modern tone of “Slither” (2006) with its gross, deliberately offensive black humor. McGowan is a highlight throughout, especially her opening go-go sequence whereas Freddy Rodriguez is surprisingly formidable. Their romantic arc is kind of touching. Another point of interest is the quality cast, rounded out by the likes of Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Naveen Andrews and Fergie. 

At the end of the day, though, “Planet Terror” fails to rise above the low-budget sorta-genius of Syfy schlock like “Flu Bird Horror” (2008), “Wyvern” (2009) and “Sasquatch Mountain” (2006) even though it cost literally twelve times as much. GRADE: C

“Death Proof” involves an embittered stuntman (Kurt Russell) and his psycho obsession with murdering young women of dubious character with his death proof stunt car (but only the driver’s side). The first half is very good, hindered only by the inane chatter of the girls. This kind of dull drivel goes into overdrive in the second half, particularly involving  Zoe Bell, Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson, but is rewarded by a thrilling car chase in the country that’s supposedly Tennessee, but obviously Southern Cal.

Russell’s character is perversely charismatic and the movie perks up whenever he’s on screen. There are no less than eight female co-stars playing mostly classless types (but not all of them) and, depending on your tastes, four of them are quite alluring,: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rose McGowan, Vanessa Ferlito and Sydney Tamiia Poitier (yes, Sidney’s daughter). GRADE: C+/B-

The two movies and additional trailers run 3 hours, 11 minutes. Unless you have that kind of time to blow, I suggest watching the movies singularly.

285923,The Movie Diorama,"Grindhouse exploits its modern B-movie experience through a bloody expressionistic tribute. Two feature films. Four fictional trailers (five if you’re lucky...). And an authentic conceptual presentation of the 70s exploitation genre, missing reels and all. Rodriguez/Tarantino’s admiration for cinema in general is tangible. Both a credible experiment in genre resurrection and a fetish for babes, blood and bolted machine gun legs. It is, at its core, a retrospective piece of entertainment. But does the double feature presentation, trailers included, work as a solid film in itself? Yes. Just about.

Two of the four fictitious trailers worked. Wright’s ‘Don’t’ replicated the essence of Hammer Film Productions perfectly with a quintessential amount of British campiness to illustrate the ghoulish plot. Not to mention the laugh out loud vagueness of the title. Roth’s (yes, this is surprising...) was another hilarious trailer with ‘Thanksgiving’, a holiday-themed slasher. Imitating existing features, such as ‘Halloween’, to deliver a barrage of nudity and decapitations. Absurd, yet sadistically amusing. These two especially suited the overall aesthetic of Grindhouse, particularly with ‘Planet Terror’. Rodriguez’ ‘Machete’, which later became a feature film’, summoned the desolate heat of the Mexploitation sub-genre. It’s fine. Occasionally becomes lost in itself when Trejo is randomly throwing machetes everywhere. Zombie’s efforts in ‘Werewolf Women of the SS’ (I know...) didn’t work for me. The concept felt like he was trying way too hard in being over-the-top and radical by merging a bunch of sets together. Intentional or not, it juxtaposed the other trailers. Cage as Fu Manchu though, I want more! Although varying in quality, these trailers do provide impressive contributions to the overall presentation and are embedded intricately before each feature film.

Speaking of features, do both ‘Planet Terror’ and ‘Death Proof’ work as a project of duality? No. The former is an absurdist’s perspective of the zombie genre, whereas the latter just resembled an ordinary Tarantino flick without the excessive exploitation. The two, together, have different paces, styles and tones which exhume varying levels of contrast, diminishing the whole feature’s flow.

There’s plenty of passion and heart being injected into this project, ultimately resulting in an enjoyable cinematic experience. Yet a prevention exists that disallows me from fully connecting to the concept. A myriad of pastiches, with varying levels of quality, as opposed to an actual presentation. I’d watch it again just for ‘Death Proof’...",2020-01-16T13:30:19.987Z,6.0,Grindhouse,2007

763,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A disgusting movie. Not recommended after meals.**

What can I say after seeing this movie? Guess I shouldn't have seen this after dinner. The film is disgusting, perhaps one of the most disgusting I have ever seen. I say this for the worst reasons. It really is a film that makes you vomit due to the images and situations it presents to us. It doesn't scare us, it never scares us. And no, it never makes us laugh, so it's not a comedy. It's a piece of cheese, but full of mold.

The film relies heavily on special effects and makeup to work, so we can't expect great performances from the cast or a solid script. The story is banal, and centers on an elderly woman who turns into a flesh-and-blood-devouring zombie, and her difficult relationship with her son. I don't feel, therefore, encouraged to talk about the cast or any of the actors, as each of them is amateur and unhappy in the work they do.

For all this, I have doubts that the film has been seen in many cinemas outside English-speaking countries. I believe that fans of gore-laden horror will have some good reasons to like this movie. It also seems safe to me to say that certain audiences will appreciate the attempts at black humor that are rehearsed.

1678,John Chard,"The big political atomic lizard is cheesed off!

After H bomb testing in the pacific, ships start to go missing and a remote island is apparently under attack from a prehistoric monster. Japanese scientists hasten to find out just what is going on, what they find is Gojira, and he is mightily hell bent on destruction...next stop Tokyo.

Gojira is such an influential film, it has spawned many sequels, remakes, copyists, and numerous homages, and of course there is two versions of this film for the viewer to choose from. The American version is a decent enough watch, it has integrated Raymond Burr into this original versions plot, and although it's unintentionally funny at times, it holds up pretty well as a no brainer piece of fluff. But it fails to compare to this original Ishirô Honda classic because this has a wonderful ambiance of fear at its heart, coming some 10 years after the Hiroshima bomb, the Japanese audiences of the time would surely have noted the heavy aura of destruction seaming through the picture. 

Watching it today, now that it's restored in all its original glory, is still a memorable and exhilarating experience, the build up is perfect, we are practically on the edge of our seats waiting to glimpse the giant atomic creature, and when he/it/she shows up for the first time, it gives us a truly memorable classic piece of cinema. Sadly the film is hampered a touch by a meandering romantic sub-plot, but the performances (notably Takeshi Shimura) are very engaging, while Akira Ifkube's score is poignantly perfect.

As man in a rubber suit movies go, Gojira has no peers, it's smart, fun, and above all else, memorable. 8/10",2015-11-29T19:30:55.056Z,8.0,Godzilla,1954

When a psychic is murdered after picking up the thoughts of a psychotic killer, Marcus Day is the only witness to the crime and sets about trying to figure out who is responsible. But he then finds that the killer is shadowing him and targeting anyone who files in to help his investigation.

Dario Argento’s Deep Red (AKA: Profundo Rosso/The Hatchet Murders) is rightly regarded as one of the leading lights of Giallo. Argento pitches Marcus Day (David Hemmings working from a splinter of Blow Up) into a rousing and visceral world of murder and mystery – and takes the viewers along as well! It doesn’t matter what time of day or night it is, Argento always has a sinister edge pulsing through his movie. The mystery element is also strong, including for first time viewers a cheeky opportunity to solve it very early on.

Painting it all in vivid coloured strokes, Argento unleashes a myriad of stylish sequences, adding in children’s toys and mannequins to further up the creep factor. Musically not all of it works, but the running children’s thematic motif works strikingly well. Negatively the dubbing is often iffy at best and some of the now infamous murder sequences veer close to comedy because the director allows them to be protracted.

764,Wuchak,"RELEASED IN 1981 (but not until April, 1983, in the USA) and written & directed by Sam Raimi, “The Evil Dead” chronicles events when five Michigan State students travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. Havoc ensues.  

This is a cult classic movie and the famous director’s first full-length feature. It only cost $350,000 to make and was shot in 1979, as well as the first weeks of 1980. Bruce Campbell makes for a quality protagonist and there’s a good trio of girl-next-door types (Ellen Sandweiss, Theresa Tilly and Betsy Baker), but Raimi only really takes advantage of these feminine resources with Sandweiss as Cheryl. 

The first half of the movie is great, which involves the five students’ arrival to the cabin and the initial possession/attack sequences. It’s atmospheric, well executed and compelling. The second half, however, is redundant. While each new attack ups the ante it’s basically more of the same in the same setting (the cabin). Don’t get me wrong, the second half is effective chaotic & chilling horror with loads of cartoony gore, but it’s too one-dimensional with no meaty subtext to chew on. It’s just people being attacked by hideous creatures, one after the other. 

This simplistic approach CAN work, as witnessed by 1972's ""Gargoyles,"" but in that movie the initial gargoyle attacks led to a captivating confrontation in their hellish cave complex in the last act. The latter half of ""The Evil Dead,"" by contrast, is just one attack after another in the same general setting. But the latter half of “The Evil Dead” is just one attack after another in the same general setting. This might work for 11-14 year-olds who are wowed by cartoonish gore and constant diabolic thrills, but it doesn’t work for more mature people who require some element of mindfood or, at least, variation to keep interested. Another negative is the final gory sequence which is decidedly low-budget and cartoony, albeit creatively and expertly done on a film student level.

I'm honestly confused why this was such a bit hit at the time.  Maybe it was just part of the trends, maybe the 1980s was just when people wanted to see horrific gore, and there was a lack of options.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's bad.  I don't feel like we get a proper explanation of what the hell is happening, so no expectations is really built to be subverted, but I certainly wouldn't want this movie to explain anymore than it did.

I'm honestly not sure exactly what to say about it: it's a ""don't mess with dark forces you can't possibly understand"" trope with a bunch of blood, gore, and weirdly designed possession.

Part of what I enjoy about (even paranormal) survival situations like this is the idea that their is / was a way out of it, if the characters can figure it out.  This is more of just someone blew up a dam, and now we're going to die from a flood.

But, once that action is established, it does not let up, with the next hour filled with nonstop thrills, leaving very little room to breathe. It was exhilarating with some fantastic tension, camera work, and special effects that had the hairs on the back of my neck standing straight up.

764,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A case study on makeup and pre-CGI effects.**

I saw this film recently, and I wasn't particularly pleased. I recognize Sam Raimi's talent and his special aptitude for horror films, but the films he made in the 80s, in my opinion, have aged poorly and today seem extremely dated. And that defines this film quite well. Even so, the film was important at the time, a huge box office success that made the fortunes of several of those involved and still has its loyal legion of fans, who will forgive me for not liking it very much, I'm sure.

The film takes place in a cabin in the forest, with a group of friends, and the undead who appear to carry out the usual massacre. There are a lot of points of contact between this film and other living dead films with a similar script, it seems that they all drew from the same primordial source. Furthermore, the film's script was clearly not the most important issue in the conception of the overall work. The story is flawed and it is the most violent scenes that save the film from being worse than it is. The ending is particularly bloody and unsuitable for sensitive people or those with more irritable stomachs.

I've seen other works by Bruce Campbell, and the truth is that this actor has never been able to convince me of his talent. He's a decent actor, but he's not a nationally or internationally talented actor. In this film, he simply does what a hero destined to survive would predictably do, under the same conditions, and jumps from cliché to cliché until the final outcome. The rest of the cast is so immeasurably weak that I won't waste time analyzing it. Suffice to say, they are there to die.

Where this film truly excels is in the use of special effects to visually accentuate the various fight scenes between young people and the undead. From the blood, to the bizarrely colored goo, and several convincing makeup effects, this film is a case study in pre-CGI makeup and visual effects, done in very cheap but surprisingly convincing and pragmatic ways. It lacked the necessary budget for more competent work, and a better cast and story.",2024-06-02T01:36:57.785Z,3.0,The Evil Dead,1981

Scream is a love ballad to horror movie fans that intimately knows and zealously honors the legacy of terror-filled films that came before while creating something new, innovative, bold, and surprising. Scream’s dark humor and admiration of overused horror plot points resulted in one of the first meta films in history. Characters know they are living a real-life horror film and yet make dumb and predictable horror movie decisions tricking the viewers into a sort of safety before breaking all the rules and surprising with unexpected twists and turns.

4232,Nathan,"**_Scream delivered a breath of fresh air into the slasher franchise and holds up rather well nearly 30 years later._**

The plot of this film follows a cookie-cutter structure that models nearly all of the great slasher franchises of the late 1970s and early 1980s, but that is entirely the point. Scream is completely aware of the tropes of horror movies and utilizes them in a creative way by adding commentary and subtle comedy delivered by the characters throughout the film. It is not a full-fledged comedy by any means; there is no forced humor or jokes, but it is more of a dark comedy that pokes fun at itself in the background.

The performances from our main cast were great. Neve Campbell delivers an excellent badass performance and is the perfect lead for the franchise. She is capable of fighting back in a brutal way and rivals Laurie Stroud from Halloween as my favorite final girl of all time. Courtney Cox was quite good as well; she had limited screen time but was able to really make the most of it. David Arquette was okay; he did not blow me away by any means, and he is quite replaceable in my opinion. Matthew Lillard was my favorite of the film; his performance was over the top and quite mentally deranged, which worked really well. Skeet Ulrich was also quite good, but took a backseat to Lillard in my opinion.

The direction of this film was great. Wes Craven did an excellent job delivering unique shots and utilizing the camera angle and height quite well. I do think this movie needs a little more gore and violence for it being a slasher film. There was really only one kill that was quite memorable to me. For it being a homage and critique of the slasher genre, it was lacking quite a bit in the slash department. In addition, the runtime felt a bit bloated, and I think if this was cut down to maybe ten minutes, the viewing experience would have been better.

Overall, I do think this movie is slightly overrated, but it is still a great film and worthy of its praise (for the most part).

6114,John Chard,"Gets worse on repeat viewings. 

Francis Ford Coppola's take on the Dracula legend sees Gary Oldman as the Count, who as a warrior prince returns from battle to find his true love, who after believing him to have been killed, has committed suicide. Renouncing his Christianity he pledges to return from the death to enact revenge on humanity. Century's later he is back to keep his word but becomes infatuated with Mina (Winona Ryder) who bears a resemblance to his long dead true love.

Forget the Bram Stoker bit, this is liberty taken wholesale, and forget any notion of this being a scary Dracula movie, for this is Gothic romance opulence. There is no doubting that as a production design goes, it's top dollar, costumes, photography, score, sets and puppetry etc, all the money is up there on the screen to please the eyes and the ears. But the narrative shift to make Dracula a tragic longing figure is a mistake, as is several casting decisions and performances. It's actually easier to say who comes out of it with credit, so step up Tom Waits as Renfield and Richard E. Grant as Dr. John Seward. Oldman is committed to the lead role, and has tortured soul down pat, but someone thought it was a good idea to make him an old ponce and stick a set of buttocks on his head! You just can't take the character seriously from the moment he appears on screen.

There's some vampire erotica as Coppola caters for the horny horror faithful, though these scenes play out like an after midnight MTV video, so not really very sexy at all. While there's a lot of fun to be had, yes you read right, with a number of scenes inserted within the dull narrative: did the great Anthony Hopkins just sniff the cheese and Keanu Reeves attempt a posh British accent? Aaargh! It should have been a Gothic classic, but clearly Coppola was out of his depth tackling such a genre. After giving myself over ten years between returning to watch the film again, I can say with confidence that it's a film that gets worse on repeat viewings.

6114,CinemaSerf,"Gary Oldman is super in this hammy reimagining of the tale of the legendary Count Dracula. Having lured his lawyer - the unsuspecting, and frankly rather insipid, ""Harker"" (Keanu Reeves) to his Transylvanian Castle he employs cunning and guile to use him to acquire ""Carfax Abbey"" in England. He also has designs on the young man's glamorous fiancée ""Mina"" (Winona Ryder) and is soon set to acquire much more than just the eerie stately pile. Luckily, ""Prof. Van Helsing"" (Anthony Hopkins) is on hand to help our rather hapless hero and perhaps they can thwart the evil intentions of their vampiric visitor? Francis Ford Coppola presents us here with a highly stylised interpretation of the legend. At times it does border on the Hammer style of production with the gore and peril really unconvincing for most of the film. The heavily made up Reeves is easy enough on the eye, but his accent is tougher on the ears and his performance is more about box office than generating any sense of menace as his red-clothed nemesis marauds around in a wig Marie Antoinette would have found fitting. It does send itself up, and that works - there is plenty that is theatrical about it, and that is what helps make this iteration distinctive. Oldman looks even inch the megalomaniac as he effortlessly glides, purrs and munches his way from Romania to Victorian England. Ryder delivers well - her part has very little substance to it, yet she does rise above the all too obvious damsel in distress persona. There are also valuable supporting efforts from Richard E. Grant and the eagle eyed might spot sword and sandals veteran Jay Robinson as ""Hawkins"". Wojciech Kilar's score helps create quite an atmosphere too, especially as we enter the last half hour of against the clock drama. I didn't much care for the way the ending is portrayed but after two hours of quickly paced and colourful entertainment, that maybe didn't matter so much. This really does need big screen visuals to have any real impact, and if you can find a cinema screening then this is very much at the better end of the Dracula genre of output - even if it does play rather fast and loose with the book!",2022-10-20T15:52:01.843Z,7.0,Bram Stoker's Dracula,1992

Army of Darkness is directed by Sam Raimi and Raimi co-writes the screenplay with his brother Ivan. It stars Bruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz, Marcus Gilbert, Ian Abercrombie, Richard Grove and Timothy Patrick Quill. Music is by Joseph LoDuca and cinematography by Bill Pope. 

Ash (Campbell) is transported to 1300 A.D., where he must battle an army of the dead and retrieve the Necronomicon so he can return home. 

Unofficially it's Evil Dead III, but as the fans will atest, this is a very different animal to the two films that preceeded it. Blending high energy jinks in medieval times with comedy horror staples, it's a riotous idea that mostly works. Of course one has to accept it on its riotous terms, this for sure isn't a pic for the highbrow crowd. Though it should at least be given the chance to brighten a dark day.

Campell as Ash is put through the mangler once again, with some nifty physical comedy nestling nicely with that of Ash's anachronistic verbalities. It's all breakneck stuff that's performed with a wonderfully self mocking attitude that's easy to warm to. It's a comic book brought to life and it never sags, but some of the cartoon sequence beasties sadly do look a little flat.

Great fun if prepared for what type of pic it is, it's not hard to see why it is so beloved in Evil Dead fan circles. 7/10

""Lord Arthur"" (Marcus Gilbert) is his new master and together with his fellow prisoner ""Duke Henry the Red"" (Richard Grove) is soon facing doom at the bottom of a deadly pit! Luckily, he has a few useful things in the boot of his car, and the timely use of a chainsaw helps him escape and become the designated saviour who will retrieve the ""Necronomicon"". His quest will involve a treacherous journey through the land of the ""Deadites"" in search of a sacred book. Only the immortal words of Michael Rennie himself: ""Klaatu Barada Nikto"" can save the day... Well, needless to say, none of this grand plan actually works. He forgets half of his magic phrase and only succeeds in resurrecting a somewhat narked army of dead folks who are determined to lay siege to their castle and retrieve the book for themselves. Enemies soon become friends, arrows become strapped to dynamite, trebuchets start lobbing high explosives and all are now hoping to defeat, well, the already dead! This actually benefits hugely from not having a star. The whole ensemble cast join in to create a quickly paced, ""Camelot"" style action adventure that borrows heavily from twentieth century references (I'm sure the script has a bit of Jack Hawkins from ""Ben Hur"" here too) and Ian Abercrombie does a fine job as the wiseman. There's plenty of pyrotechnics and swordplay, a generous amount of rather daft humour and, for my money, is one of Sam Raimi's better, more entertaining features. Derivative?

766,Nathan,"Army of Darkness is such a mix bag for me, on one hand it is a very fun and whimsical fantasy adventure but on the other it is such a step away from the franchise that it feels out of place. It is marketed as a horror film, but there is absolutely zero tension or spooks to be had in its entire runtime, luckily the movie was actually quite funny. Raimi tried to do a bit too much in the special effects department, leaving many of the effects feel cheap and out of place. The green screen technology especially just was not there for the time. Raimi's direction was very relevant, and his signature touch on the film really helped. The performances and writing absolutely save the film. Bruce Campbell is the best he's ever been, with incredible line delivery that had be legitimately laughing out loud. The quick witty dialogue between characters was hilarious. Overall, Army of Darkness is by no means a bad movie, but it does take a step a little too far from the source material, which just didn't resonate with me as much.

766,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A perfect ""trash"" movie.**

When I saw this movie a few hours ago, I didn't know it was a sequel to “Evil Dead”, a movie I haven't seen yet. I generally like to start the franchises in the right order. However, and as far as I was reading, this film is the one that most differs from the antecedents, not least because the action takes place in the medieval period, and revolves around the possession of a book, the legendary Necronomicon.

Contrary to what one might think, the Necronomicon was not an invention of Sam Raimi, or any of the elements in the film. The book was created by the writer H. P. Lovecraft, and the idea came to be used for the film. Raimi is a creative and original director, and it's not surprising that such a bizarre film came out of his head. Basically, what we have here is a simple warehouse employee who, after handling the book, is teleported to the year 1300. And of course, to return to our time, he will have to find the book there, and overcome dangers of various order, starting with the medieval nobles themselves, at war with each other.

Bruce Campbell is the only actor who deserves mention in this cast of vast names in which there is no one who stands out positively. The cast is really one of the weaknesses and uninteresting of the film! And even Campbell is so irritating and arrogant that I didn't sympathize with his character at all, even though I know he's the hero and will somehow end up saving the day.

The film is corny, it's quite cheap (we only need to look at the poor quality of the stop-motion animations and visual or special effects to see that) and it's so absurd that it's hilarious. There are scenes that seem to be taken from a satire, or a school play. It is impossible not to laugh at such a film, a perfect “trash” film.",2023-06-01T07:17:12.240Z,3.0,Army of Darkness,1992

36685,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**As a film, it could be better, but it's funny and bizarre enough for us to see it at least once in our lives.**

This is one of those films that everyone should see at least once in their life. It's a pretty good comedy musical where satire meets nonsense intensely, in a film adaptation of an English play that had been successful at the time. I don't know much about the stage version, I don't even know if there are any concrete differences, but I can say that the film gives us exactly what it promises.

The story told is probably the film's biggest weakness: anyone who likes logic and a story with some consistent structure will be disappointed with this purposefully disjointed, sloppy and surrealistic script, where an innocent and foolish engaged couple ends up lost in a storm and ends up in a gothic mansion. There lives the bizarre Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a kind of mad scientist who is proudly gay, transvestite and from “Transsexual Transylvania”, presumably another planet or dimension. He has just created a man for his sexual pleasure and is celebrating this effusively with other strange characters, such as his enslaved servants.

From the moment the couple enters the mansion and meets its owner and his guests, the film stops and starts to hiccup a lot: the director had no good ideas to present from then on and limited himself to recreating the play in a cinematic environment. Obviously, the film has an intense sexual energy that challenges us to awaken our sexuality, to explore our bodies, pleasure and sexual identity. Sexual maturity, sexual identity and homosexuality are strong themes that underlie the script and fit well into the era in which the film appeared (remember, the Sexual Revolution was still leaving its marks at this time). Furthermore, the Counterculture was experiencing an intense moment at the time and made its aesthetic and visual contribution, which was very noticeable in the sets and costumes.

The film has some anthology-worthy scenes, such as Frank-N-Furter's personal introduction at the beginning of the film, and a very strong cast dominated by actors with unquestionable talent. Tim Curry, in his film debut, is gigantic in the lead role and absolutely dominates every scene. He's sexy, he's provocative, he's malevolent, intense and sometimes cruel. The actor gives himself completely to his work, without fear, and offers us work of absolute value. Susan Sarandon, still exuding youth, is perfect as a modest, sexually repressed and docile young woman, and Barry Bostwick seems an excellent choice for her romantic partner. Richard O’Brien and Charles Gray also do a good job, while Patricia Quinn and Nell Campbell work very well on the songs, but have little to add when the music stops. On the negative side... Jonathan Addams added very little to the film, Meat Loaf makes only one unnecessary appearance and Peter Hinwood, whose character could have been more central, is quickly discarded.

On a technical level, the film has several quality aspects that deserve our analysis and a positive comment, starting with the colorful, clear and impactful cinematography, and the elaborate and bizarre sets. The makeup and costumes are impressive, with a strong “punk” inspiration, but they look cheap. The castle where much of the film was made is beautiful and fits well into the story. Being a musical, the soundtrack is crucial and works very well. Even the less interesting songs work well from a narrative point of view, moving the film forward, with sung dialogue and the action advancing to the rhythm of the music. The opening credits song is iconic, as is “Sweet Trasvestite” which introduces us to the main character, but I confess that I especially liked “There’s a Light”. It's a very beautiful song and full of hope.",2024-03-05T04:53:05.281Z,7.0,The Rocky Horror Picture Show,1975

When the dream becomes a reality for one of the kids, and the worst happens, Nancy Thompson risks all to bring the bogeyman into the open.

Stupendous horror movie, one that not even the ream of sequels, spin- offs and cartoons could ever diminish. Wes Craven creates a film of utter terror, unleashing one of the genres most famous monsters on the unsuspecting film loving public, with Robert Englund as the hideous Fred Krueger having the time of his life slashing away and delivering oral venom.

The youthful cast are sensibly written (Craven's screenplay that took inspiration from a true story he read about Cambodian refugees literally dying of nightmares!), they are not dumb these kids, just vulnerable, but led by Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) there may be hope of some survivors?

It doesn't hang about - Wes Craven keeps the pace almost frantic, and there is plenty of humour to keep it's tongue in it's cheek.

30497,Wuchak,"***Disturbing iconic slasher about a demented family in rural Texas***

After a van of young people picks up a psycho hitchhiker in east Texas they stumble upon a farm house of crazies, including a burly mute man with a mask made of human-skin.   

Tobe Hooper’s ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) is a seminal, iconic slasher that’s genuinely disturbing and horrific because it plays out in a gritty, realistic manner. While some viewers might find a couple of scenes amusing, like Franklin in his wheelchair accidently rolling down the hill and, later, having a hammy fit in the dilapidated building, it doesn’t change the fact that this is a serious, unsettling horror flick. 

By contrast, Rob Zombie’s homage (or rip-off), “House of 1000 Corpses” (2003), wasn’t disturbing or horrific at all because he opted for an over-the-top, cartoony approach. It was colorful and amusing, yes, but not unsettling or horrifying.

Other positives include the rural locations, cool nighttime sequences, e.g. the thorn bush, and the effectively photographed women with no raunch: Teri McMinn (Pam) and Marilyn Burns (Sally). They’re girl-next-door types, but alluring enough.

So this is a standout film as far as serious slasher horror goes and I can understand those who give it a high rating, but horror movies are about more than just scaring & troubling the viewer. For me, the last act is overly one-dimensional, focusing too much on the eye-rolling demonic dirtbag family and a girl fleeing & screaming. It’s thoroughly manic, indeed, but also vacuous and uninspiring.       

The film runs 1 hour, 23 minutes; there’s also an 88 minute unrated version. It was shot in east Texas as follows: Round Rock (house), Bastrop (gas station/BBQ shack), Leander (cemetery) and Watterson (slaughterhouse). The house has since been moved to Kingsland and refurbished as a restaurant.

Except, it doesn't quite pan out quite how we might anticipate - else how we could we ever have known about this story? It's all about the last twenty minutes and even then I found it all rather flat and noisy. Way too much of the sense of peril here comes from endless screaming, running about in the bushes in the dark and the behaviour of visitors who just haven't a clue about basic self-preservation. Who would set off into unknown terrain in pitch dark pushing a bloke in a wheelchair after three of their friends had gone missing? Once we meet the perpetrators, again it all just comes across as something that wouldn't look out of place in a Carry On film made in the Hammer House of Horrors - there isn't an hint of menace at any point amongst the faux gore and crescendo hysterics. It's clearly been made on a tiny budget and the production standards reflect that - the continuity is a bit of a joke with wounds that are there then not or windows that self-repair...

7340,RalphRahal,"Brian De Palma's Carrie (1976) remains an iconic adaptation of Stephen King's novel, blending psychological horror with deeply human themes of alienation and vengeance. The film’s portrayal of high school life, social cruelty, and supernatural terror is deeply affecting, resonating with audiences even decades later.

From its infamous opening locker room scene to the chaotic prom climax, De Palma's direction demonstrates a masterful control of mood and pacing. The visual style, characterized by long takes, slow motion, and the daring use of split-screen during the prom sequence, creates a cinematic experience that is both intimate and expansive. These techniques pull viewers into Carrie’s inner world while amplifying the horror of her ultimate revenge.

The production itself is a marvel for its time, achieving a balance between the surreal and the real. The careful choreography of the prom scene, where chaos is unleashed in a ballet of destruction, reflects De Palma’s meticulous eye for detail and his ability to innovate under pressure. It’s worth noting that some of the film's most memorable sequences, like the split-screen prom massacre, arose out of budgetary constraints—proving De Palma's ability to turn limitations into creative triumphs.

The performances elevate the material further, with Sissy Spacek's portrayal of Carrie standing out as both vulnerable and haunting. The supporting cast effectively embodies the oppressive social dynamics of high school, creating a believable and suffocating environment for the protagonist.

Understanding De Palma’s personal history adds another layer to the film’s intensity. His exposure to the visceral realities of his father’s work as a surgeon shaped his comfort with the graphic and the grotesque, evident in the film’s bloody moments. Additionally, De Palma's own experience trailing his father to uncover an affair—an event he later described as formative—infuses his work with themes of voyeurism, psychological tension, and human frailty. These personal elements lend Carrie a raw authenticity that transcends its horror genre trappings.

Despite the controversy surrounding its explicit content, Carrie avoids gratuity in favor of storytelling. De Palma’s bold choices underscore the film’s central themes rather than overshadow them, making it as much a character study as a tale of terror. The film's success helped cement his reputation as a provocative yet deeply skilled filmmaker, unafraid to explore the darker corners of human experience.

Revisiting Carrie highlights why it remains a classic. Its blend of compelling performances, innovative cinematography, and psychological depth sets it apart not only from other adaptations of King’s novel but also from modern horror films attempting similar themes. De Palma’s ability to channel his personal experiences into his art gives Carrie an emotional resonance and cinematic flair that continues to captivate audiences.",2024-12-14T16:55:31.532Z,8.0,Carrie,1976

293670,Reno,"**A father's struggle to see his daughter to get well.**

A new film from the writer, director of 'The Chaser' and 'The Yellow Sea'. This time its a horror-thriller that focused on a rural police officer who witnesses a series of strange events escalating fears among its people. The original title was 'Goksung', which means the name of the village where this story takes place. This film is specially for those who like Korean films. But I'm sure that everyone would enjoy it equally. Very typical Korean film yet an engaging theme and thrilling, particularly towards the final quarter.

The opening, and almost the first act were like a black comedy. That does remain same after sometime. Because they wanted to give an impression what kind of person is this story's lead man. He's a cop, but feared of supernatural stuffs. So one day, he gets an early morning call to head where a family was slaughtered by one of its members. In his small village, with a small population, events like this are very rare, but when another similar incident was reported, ruled out what it was considered, but something else beyond humans.

After the strange dreams, he comes to know his family too got affected by it, particularly his young daughter. Followed by when it gets serious issue, the family decides to bring in a shaman and so the ceremony begins to free her from whatever possessed. This is where the film turns more aggressive in revealing following event with twists and turns. The rest of the film should be watched to know how it all ends.

The first thing was the film length. It was too long, nearly 150 minutes, but the screenplay filled with many enthralling scenes and dialogues. So I don't think sitting for that long would be an issue for most of the people. Surely you will be on your seat edge most of the time on your watch. Good story, but very confusing. I mean not puzzling way, but the events and its characters, especially the conclusion which is not exactly a perfect one with proper detail. So you might look for some clarifications after watching the film.

> ""If you go fishing, do you know what you'll catch? He's just fishing. Not even he knows what he'll catch.""

The concept was a little confusing like what kind of horror is this. At one stage there comes a zombie, but it follows right after an exorcism on a girl possessed by a ghost. The writer used the time as long as he wants to develop them. So the narration was slow, but very steady on its direction going deep. If you are good at Korean films, the style they make, you might predict some of the scenes correctly. Like I said the final few minutes might confuse you, but really well done part if you understand that clearly.

The film characters wise, I liked how it all connected at the end. But as a story, the solution did not seem right. I think not the fitting one or more convincing. I know who would you root, I mean most of you back what character, so from that perspective, feels it compromised a bit after put up a stern fight with what they had believed. I liked how culturally this story was narrated. I mean as its set in a small village, the ceremonies to fight the evil spirit was conducted traditional way, not the western style, except it opened with a quote from the bible.

The actors were perfect, particularly I liked where it was shot. A fine location to mix horror and cop themes. The suspense keeps the film alive, but you won't always looking at that, because the theme expands quite bigger than you expect. There are some unexpected turns, you might find yourself scratching your head for how deep it could go.

Don't worry, in the end, it all comes together, or maybe watching it twice could help you with that. As I said the runtime might not favour you for the second viewing. Besides, pay a good attention while watching it for the first time, then you will get everything. Particularly if you are an animal lover, that's a biggest clue you could get in this film.

I think it will be one of the best horror you would find around the world this year. It might get remade elsewhere, but the chances are less and it could remain as one of the Korean classics in the line of many others like 'Memories of Murder'. You don't have to be a Korean film fan or this director's, but if you do, surely you will have an advantage in understanding it clearly and like it more than the others. Definitely it is one of the best Korean films, but I don't think so a must see, not according to me. Though I won't conclude my review without recommending it to you. So I say watch it.

293670,Key-Si,"Watching ""The Wailing"" is quite an undertaking. With a runtime of almost 3 hours this Korean Horror-Triller is a shear beast. Unfortunately I feel like pretty much more than half the runtime should have been cut. ""The Wailing"" circles around in a seemingly endless ""who done it"" or, to be more precise, ""who is it"" and even though the acting of our lead Do-won Kwak was not too bad, the dialogues bothered me constantly. I find myself repeating this for about every Asian movie and I assume it must be a cultural thing. I mostly find the talk so generic and pointless, that you could reduce some movies to 5-10 important lines and let them be quiet for the entire rest of the runtime. And this movie is no different. The best acting performance was delivered by Jun Kunimura, who not only presented a great play with mimic, but also refused to talk much (I bet he knew I would appreciate that). The cinematography was pretty good and I liked the realistic appearing gore effects. Not so much on the ""possessed zombies"" but therefore on the crime scenes and such. With that many pro's and con's ""The Wailing"" ends up somewhere in the middle and can therefore be labeled average.",2018-06-18T03:32:44.371Z,5.0,The Wailing,2016
293670,Kai,"I don't often use the word masterpiece. I've seen 1,040 films in my life, totalling 1,549 hours of filmography. There's maybe 7 I would label a masterpiece with full usage and definition of the word.

The Wailing is the eighth film of one thousand and forty films I very willingly, gladly and without hesitation give the title of Masterpiece to.

I'm not too big of a fan of Asian supernatural horror. Whilst I very much enjoy it and give most films a pretty decent average rating, I find a lot of them bleed into one another with similar plots and a very safe view on the supernatural. In Japan it tends to be curses that have people die in mysterious ways, South Korea, a cursed object that has people murder each other are the most common ones I come across.

When I clicked The Wailing was supernatural, I prepared myself for a 6 or maybe 7 out of 10 movie that was good but wouldn't hold its own too well in the vast expanse of horror.

The Wailing gave me some stunning frames. The cinematography in this is beautiful. The gore frames are gruesome, unadulterated and unapologetic. The ritualism and belief of South Korea are shown in their full glory without fear. Na Hong Jin doesn't shy away from racial tension between the Japanese and South Koreans with a slightly historical take with a beautiful twisting story that left me with my mouth gaping open but still feeling just slightly uncomfortable - something I believe Hong Jin did on purpose. I was shown acting that was so well done, no matter what I watch these actors in from now on, I will always know them from The Wailing. The varying supernatural aspects were unique, something that stunned me, unafraid to step out of genre restrictions and lead the way with something new. With a story line that is intriguing, stunning and just raw, this two and a half hour journey was worth watching.

This is a film deserving of the hype that numerous other Asian horrors got but turned out to be predictable messed. THIS is the Korean horror of 2016, the one that should have lead the forefront of South Korean, or even Asian, horror into 2017. This is a film that shows prowess, promise and skill. Hong Jin treats us to such wonderful skills from not just himself but his script writer, his cast, his editing team, his make up team, etc, everyone involved. You can feel the passion and love and pure dedication that went into this movie.

A full 10/10 is just not enough for this film.

It starts slow paced and almost doesn't give you enough information to work out exactly whats going on leaving it up to your paranoia and imagination to fill the void, this begins to change the movie into more of a horror with a scifi plot.

11850,Wuchak,"When San Francisco is invaded by pod-people  

RELEASED IN 1978 and directed by Philip Kaufman, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" stars Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams as friends, Matthew and Elizabeth, who work at the Health Department in San Francisco. They increasingly suspect that people are somehow being duplicated and trace the problem to alien plant pods. Leonard Nimoy plays Matthew’s pop psychologist friend while Jeff Goldblum & Veronica Cartwright are on hand as a couple who run a mudbath parlour.

This could be viewed as a sequel rather than a remake. The entries in the series are as follows: ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956); ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1978); ""Body Snatchers"" (1993); and ""The Invasion"" (2007).

The first one is in Black & White and is probably too dated and tame for most modern viewers, but it's still worthwhile; it takes place in small town, California. This 1978 sequel switches the setting to the big city. The 1993 movie shifts to an army base in the deep south while the 2007 version switches back to the big city of Washington DC.

This rendition has a peculiar tone with a lot of the events taking place at night. There’s a subdued eerie and dreary air with paranoia morphing into conspiratorial and then ghastly reality. The 70’s atmosphere and cast are highlights, as is the score with its unnerving pieces. Brooke Adam’s has exquisitely sculptured facial features (eyes, nose, lips, teeth, chin, cheeks and forehead). The creepy pod-birthing sequence in the garden is cogently done.

Well that's because he has fallen in love with a photograph of his beautiful wife ""Lucy"" (Isabelle Adjani) and has determined to make her his immortal bride. ""Harker"" had been warned by the locals of the dangers of visiting the ""Count"" but he pressed on regardless, so ought not to have been surprised when his host absconds from his castle on a schooner laden with coffins, soil and a deadly plague of rats so he can ensnare his innocent young wife. Can he race back home in time to thwart this evil? There's nothing especially new about the chronology of the story here, it's the characterisation of the vampire that helps this stand out. It's obvious from the start that ""Dracula"" is not of human kind. Contrasting with most interpretations of the title role, Kinski and Warner Herzog attempt to imbue ""Dracula"" with a degree of humanity. He doles out his lusts left, right and centre upon the innocent, spreading plague and disaster wherever he goes, but he too is cursed. By his own immortality, by his search for some kind of fulfilment or contentedness. This isn't a depiction riddled with sharp teeth and ketchup, it's much more subtle, refined even, telling of a character that it's almost impossible not to feel sorry for. The production itself has dated rather badly, and at times it did remind me of one of these ""Sherlock Holmes"" remakes, but the thrust of the story is still interestingly different to the normal depiction of this epitome of evil and worth sticking with.",2024-04-29T08:41:45.623Z,7.0,Nosferatu the Vampyre,1979

“Dracula” (1931) was based on the play rather than the novel, but the basic Bram Stoker tale is there with alterations. In its time, this was great. Talkies had only been around for a handful of years. Don’t expect the nudity, violence or gore of Coppola’s “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992). If you want a modern take on the tale, I suggest that one (which adds a well-done love story).  

The focus here is on the handsome & intimidating Count’s calm charisma and hypnotic powers within a Victorian milieu and cobwebbed, crumbling Gothic architecture. It’s somehow relaxing despite the horror trappings. You have to accept this going in to appreciate it.

There’s a Spanish-speaking version with a different actor in the eponymous role shot simultaneously, which many say is superior. Also, a score was added by Philip Glass in 1999. There’s also a colorized version. I viewed the original B&W film with Bela Lugosi. His iconic take on the king of vampires is worth the price of admission. The climax is weak though.

The movie runs 1 hour, 15 minutes, and was shot at Universal Studios and Agua Dulce, which is in the desert high country north of there.

He is just an innocent estate agent who arrives at Castle Dracula only to find himself quickly enthralled to his new boss who is determined to come to ""Carfax Abbey"" in England with his trio of wives, and to wreak some good, old-fashioned, havoc! It's poor ""Mina"" (Helen Chandler) who is soon on his radar and it falls to her paramour ""Harker"" (David Manners) and accomplished vampire-hunter ""Van Helsing"" (Edward Van Sloan) to try and save the day before they are all transformed into blood-suckers. Lugosi is a wooden as a washboard in this film, but the constant shining of the light onto his eyes does manage to convey quite a potent sense of menace as his meticulously dressed count munches his way through the wee small hours. The flying bat on a string is not as daft as you might expect, indeed the whole visual impact of this film - though certainly basic - proves quite effective when the score does most of the heavy lifting.

11772,John Chard,"And whatever walked there, walked alone.

The Haunting is directed by Robert Wise and adapted to screenplay by Nelson Gidding from the Shirley Jackson novel The Haunting of Hill House. It stars Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson, Russ Tamblyn and Lois Maxwell. Music is by Humphrey Searle and cinematography by David Boulton.

Hill House has a troubled history, death, either by accident or by suicide, has occurred there over the years. Today, Dr. Markway, an anthropologist and investigator of paranormal activity, leads a team of four for a stay at Hill House, where they will stay for a period of time in the hope that Markway can prove something paranormal resides there

The haunted house premise has been a staple for horror film makers since forever. To place the viewer in a murky house, alongside some character unfortunates, and then scare the tar out of them has always been the aim. It hasn't often worked to great effect, in fact the number of genuine scary haunted house movies barely trouble the fingers of both hands. How strange, then, that the best of the bunch chose a simple formula that has never been replicated since with the same great effect.

The Haunting thrives not on what it throws at you by way of jumps and peek-a-boo visceral shocks, it deals firmly in the realm of what you can't see scares you the most. Where we have to use our own fretful imaginations to fill in the blanks for us, which is never a good thing in psychological horror parlance. Robert Wise, a most gifted and versatile director, uses oblique camera angles, thundering sound effects and angled close ups of his actors to get the maximum amount of atmosphere from the premise.

Distortion is very much a key component here. We are told the history of the house and some of its structural quirks, the camera angles heighten this for ethereal impact whilst simultaneously marrying up to the distortion of a key character's mental health. The story in essence sounds simple, yet there is much bubbling away in Hill House, both on the page and up there on the screen. This is not simply a case of a group of people being haunted by a spectre or otherwise, the mind is a key player here, very much so.

Along the way are some truly breath holding scenes; a bending door, pounding in the corridor, a face on the wall (the lighting here genius), Nell's hand holding incident, a rickety spiral staircase that we fear from the off, and the ghostly finale as Hill House reveals its hand and what we thought was a simple and true narrative is actually more clever, more chilling than we first imagined. Suggestion is a very big thing in The Haunting, it's what drives it to greatness, but it also has scenes that really bring the gooseflesh jumping up on your arms.

The acting is mostly great, with Tamblyn and Johnson correctly underplaying their roles to let the two girls take centre stage. Both Harris and Bloom are excellent. As Nell, Harris is nervous, introverted and caught up in the atmosphere of the house, it's the pivotal role and Harris instills a heart aching fragility into the character. Bloom as Theodora has mystical qualities, a sexiness and a devilishly playful disposition, things that play off of Harris' egg shell walking quite brilliantly. While the house itself (exterior is Ettington Park Hotel in Stratford-Upon-Avon) is an ominous character all of its own. As Nell first spies the monolithic frontage she muses that it's a monster waiting to swallow her, a small creature, whole; we know exactly how she feels.

Still the template haunted house movie, accept no substitutes and ignore stupid claims of homophobia, this is intelligent, scary and crafted with great skill. 10/10",2020-10-04T23:10:18.359Z,10.0,The Haunting,1963
11772,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A simple film with a basic script, but which scares us in such a way that it still has an influence on horror productions today.**

Movies about haunted houses? Whoever saw one of them, saw them all… right? I like to think not. And this film is probably the grandfather of a good number of them! Currently forgotten due to the passage of time, the film had a much weaker remake in 1999, and I believe that it is itself a rewrite of “House on Haunted Hill”, released three years earlier, in 1959, and which also has already deserved a new production in recent years. The impact of this film on the industry and horror genre was notable and continues to have some echoes.

The story begins by introducing us to Hill House, a fateful mansion shrouded in a cloak of mystery and a past of death. Unlike the modern remake, this film never explores the origins of that evil, it simply accepts it and places the characters inside the house, under the pretext of a paranormal investigation clumsily led by a parapsychologist obsessed with proving the veracity of haunting phenomena and the afterlife.

As a story told, the film is frankly poor and leaves us with more questions than answers. We are presented with a psychological experiment conducted without criteria and which, if it had been true, would have shocked the scientific community and led to a variety of legal consequences. Do I need to say that the study would have to stop at the first sign of danger to the mental health of one of the participants? Issues that seem logical, such as the fact that the subjects volunteer in writing, after fully knowing what will be done and the risks, are put aside, as are the hostile attitudes of the caretakers, who are not satisfied with the additional work, or the passivity of Eleanor's family, which only appears to show how uprooted the character would feel.

The cast is not very well known but makes a commendable effort. Lois Maxwell is perhaps the most easily known name, but she appears for a very short time and doesn't add much with her participation. She gives life, moreover, to the most apparently sane person in the midst of that madness. And I'm not saying that I don't believe in the supernatural: in fact I do, but I'm more afraid of the living than the dead and I don't accept any nonsense. It's Julie Harris who dominates the screen with an inspired and crazy interpretation of someone living on the brink of a mental breakdown. She is friendly, and we agonize with her scares and fear. Claire Bloom also does an interesting, more restrained and sarcastic job.

If the audience is expecting fluttering sheets or skeletons animated by nylon strings, it's best to forget: the film does not use carnival tricks, preferring to intelligently use sound, image, shadows and camera angles to create an atmosphere of tension and threat. The result is frankly positive: when we don't see what scares us, we don't know what to expect, and that intimidates us. Knocks on wood, heavy footsteps, punches against doors, muffled laughter, the range of sound effects is rich and was used in a creative and very credible way. The filming location, a huge English neo-Gothic mansion, is wonderful and was put to great use. All interior settings are exquisitely crafted and look authentic. The house itself is a dense, rich and mysterious character, a villain worthy of an anthology.",2023-09-12T11:49:37.076Z,9.0,The Haunting,1963
11772,CinemaSerf,"The wealthy ""Crain"" builds a gothic mansion in a remote part of New England where he plans to house his new wife and daughter. Mysteriously, she doesn't survive long enough to ever move in and as we skip forward almost a century, we find the house bleak and run-down and now inherited by a distant relative of the daughter. It's this house that ""Dr. Markway"" (Richard Johnson) is determined to investigate. He has convinced the new owner ""Mrs Sannerson"" (Fay Compton) to allow him and his team to try to prove or disprove for once and for all whether there are such things as ghosts! This house will be the ideal venue for his work and assisted by her rather feckless nephew ""Luke"" (Russ Tamblyn) as well as the spiritual medium ""Theodora"" (Clare Bloom) and the young ""Nell"" (Julie Harris) who seems nervously plugged-in to the house and it's secrets. As night falls, and for the next few days we discover that there are indeed some horrific tales surrounding this edifice involving abuse both physical and psychological amongst it's occupants. Needless to say, these shenanigans profoundly affect the young ""Nell"" and as she struggles, those fears seem to become contagious as pretty soon everyone is equally spooked by numerous terrifyingly inexplicable activities going on in this house. The question is, though, is this really activity from another dimension or might cold and calculating minds be trying a bit of manipulation. This is a genuinely quite scary adaptation of the book that uses some dimly lit and rather brutal photography, a fair degree of skilfully produced audio and two strong performances from Bloom and Harris to help create an escalating sense of the menacing as panic sets in and rational thinking jumps out of the window. This isn't an horror film that relies on ketchup and jellied eyes, it's a good deal more sophisticated and unlike many of it's contemporaries, it really does cultivate a sense of jeopardy until very near a conclusion that I certainly didn't really anticipate until pretty near the end.

What would we do if, while preparing our doctoral or master's thesis, accidentally came across evidence of a murder? I bet with most people, the obvious thing would be to go straight to the police and hand the matter over to the professionals, right? This is not what Angela decides to do when, while preparing her thesis on violence in cinema, she comes across a “snuff” video, showing a student from her college being savagely murdered and chopped into pieces. A video that caused her thesis advisor's sudden death when he saw it.

Despite the very low budget, the film is really very well-made, and a clear sign of the great capacity, talent and creativity of its director, Alejandro Amenábar, one of the best and most regular Spanish directors (regular in the quality of his work, because he is one of those who only make a movie occasionally). I don't know, but while watching the film, I got the feeling that the director drew inspiration from his own academic experience, especially when he studied at the Complutense University in Madrid.

We don't have, in this film, easily recognizable actors, but it wasn't difficult for me, who saw most of the director's work, to recognize Eduardo Noriega's face, and to appreciate the actor's well-done job, in the role of a magnetic, charming and elusive student, who may very well be the great villain (or not, watch the movie). Ana Torrent also did a job well done, although not much was required of her. Fele Martínez was also pleasant, giving the character a welcome irreverence and a somewhat unpredictable way of acting. Xabier Elorriaga looks a lot like some idiot college professor, so I also think he did well in the role he was given.

Being a low-cost film, with few resources, we don't have anything visually ostentatious here, nor great effects. The film was planned to be simple, and the production clearly worked with what they had at hand: the sets and costumes are quite uncharacteristic, but they are within what we expect to see, since filming was almost always done on location. I really have doubts if there was a place that we can call a “studio” in this production.

What we have here is a case of style over substance.  There is really nothing to ""hang your hat on"" with regards to what is happening to the family featured.  When the reveals start coming they are either obvious or trite.  The ending is complete crap, especially after the two hour journey to get to it.

The scariest scene happens early on and is not in any way supernatural.  After, we just go on and on and round and round and can only assume the mother is mentally ill.  That she is imagining everything that is ""odd"" or causing it herself.

This isn't an average Halloween, popcorn-at-the-theatre moviegoing experience.

Toni Collette plays Annie Graham, mother of two children - eldest son in high school, the youngest a girl possibly at the tail-end of middle school. With the recent death of her mother, Annie attempts again and again to reconcile with the misfortunes - to put it lightly - that befalls her family. Annie's psychological state dances between the forefront of the film, while the backdrop of lingering family turmoil boils to the top.

This is an unrelenting experiment in acceptance, both placed on the key figures in the film, as well as those watching. When watching, keep in mind the word ""control"" and discern whether Annie had any at all. This isn't a movie for anybody - I'd go far as to say that this movie isn't for the average moviegoer.

With two children, 16-year-old Peter (Alex Wolff) and 13-year-old Charlie (Milly Shapiro), and a loving husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), Annie is determined to do a better job of raising a family than she felt her mother did. However, when she suffers another, far more devastating loss, Annie's mental state becomes increasingly precarious, as a series of terrifying revelations about her ancestry are slowly revealed.

Hereditary is writer/director Ari Aster's debut feature. However, what's worth noting is that the film is produced by Lars Knudsen, who also produced _The VVitch: A New England Folktale_ (2015). This is significant insofar as _Hereditary_ bears more than a passing resemblance to Robert Eggers's film. Mood, tone, theme, pacing, narrative structure, shot composition; all recall _The VVitch_ at times. Even the plot shares some important beats, most evident in the last shot, which is both narratively and compositionally identical to the shot in _The VVitch_ when Black Phillip speaks for the first time - a BCU on a possessed character as a disciple speaks off camera. And like _The VVitch_, you either go with the plot and let it burrow under your skin, or you remain detached and most likely find the whole enterprise unintentionally hilarious.

In a more generalised sense, there is quite a bit to praise here. For a start, to say the film is a horror is to basically give away the last 20 minutes, as up until that point it's a superbly realised semi-realist study of the crippling psychological disintegration that can accompany bereavement. Speaking of giving things away, very unusually for a Hollywood film, _Hereditary_'s trailer brilliantly misdirects the audience, making it seem as if the film revolves around the death of Annie's mother, when in actual fact, this plot strand is abandoned at the end of the first act, after which the death of Charlie becomes the central focus.

One thing the film does especially well is reward viewers who are paying attention. There are multiple hints and signs throughout of what is going to happen in the last act, and one especially well structured reward involves by far the creepiest moment in the film; the blond man standing in the shadows of the doorway, barely visible, smiling manically at Peter. This is actually the second time we see the character; he is also at the wake early in the movie, watching Charlie approaching the coffin, and, again, smiling unnaturally. This can be easily missed if you're not paying attention, and it's an extremely well realised pseudo-Easter egg. Also worthy of praise is Toni Collette, who gives a superb performance that partly recalls Shelley Duvall's hysterics in Stanley Kubrick's _The Shining_ (1980). Collette's ability to communicate everything in her psyche by simply changing her facial expression is outstanding, and somewhat reminiscent of that extraordinary piece of wordless acting by Halle Berry in the last scene of Marc Foster's _Monster's Ball_ (2001). This is especially noticeably towards the end of the film, when Annie is alternating between being herself and being controlled by Paimon; Collette's mastery of her own facial expression tells the audience everything it needs to know about what is happening.

Joshua Rothkopf, in his review of the film for _Time Out_ calls it ""_a new generation's_ Exorcist."" That's a bit over the top; it won't have half the same kind of societal impact as William Friedkin's film did, and it's nowhere near as good as the best horror film of the last few decades, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez's _The Blair Witch Project_ (1999). However, it's very well made, is creepy as hell, dares to put real grief on screen, and features excellent performances (and, thankfully, only a couple of jump scares). Well worth seeing.",2019-04-25T06:13:45.966Z,7.0,Hereditary,2018
493922,Rando,"I've been meaning to watch this movie for a while now and made the mistake of watching this 12 at night while I was alone (Don't do that!) Usually horror movies don't effect me and if they do its usually while the movie is playing. But this movie has stayed with me for days now. I can't get it out of my head. This is not a movie for someone who wants jump scares, slasher death/screams or a movie that plays in the background. You have to actually pay attention or you will be completely confused at the end. There are subtle hints throughout the movie to show you where the movie is headed but there are still surprises throughout. 

The acting is very good. I have to say though I love Toni Collette and that was one of the main reasons I watched it. ***Spoilers Start*** Toni Collette and Alex Wolff do an amazing job carrying this movie. After Charlie's death, the look on Alex's face conveys so much that words are not necessary to understand that shock he is under. There is no overacting or crying or screaming just shock and utter disbelief.***Spoilers End*** Everyone in the family does an amazing job in their roles. Charlie is just so creepy throughout the movie. You empathize with all of them and understand their frustrations even while knowing some of their decisions are just plain wrong.

Though there are no conventional jump scares the atmosphere of the movie has you on edge the whole time. There is a building of tension between the family from all things unsaid about their past/current trauma and the grief that they are currently going through that comes to a head. Watching this family completely come undone is emotionally heavy but also  has terrifying consequences. 

Definitely a must watch if you like horror. But not for people who want to be scared in the moment with killings and jump scares.",2021-03-22T18:58:43.670Z,10.0,Hereditary,2018

I did find the opening half of the film the strongest, in the second half I lost interest ever so slightly and the ending underwhelms a tiny bit. It does, however, do impressive work in creating an unsettling environment to tell its story - there are one or two moments that did surprise me, a lot.

Toni Collette gives a brilliant performance, one that I couldn't possible pick any holes in - top stuff! Gabriel Byrne, Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro are worthy of praise as well.

493922,CinemaSerf,"Toni Collette is great in this family drama with quite a few gruesome twists! She is ""Annie"" who is mourning the recent death of her over-bearing mother. Except, as we discover when she goes to one of those bereavement groups, we discover that they were estranged and hadn't spoken for ages. Shortly after the funeral, husband ""Steve"" (Gabriel Byrne) is made aware of some unsavoury developments and then an even greater tragedy ensues that brings to an end years of bubbling resentment between her and teenage son ""Peter"" (Alex Wolff). Still struggling to comes to terms with things and with her family teetering on the bring of collapse, she is approached by ""Joan"" (Ann Dowd) who has recently suffered a tragedy of her own and who offers a means to communicate with the other world. Of course, ""Annie"" is disdainful of this proposal but glasses move, candles blow out and soon she is trying to convince her own sceptical family that they can all chat to the dead! There's the odd bit of ceiling-crawling and a few visual effects to make us jump a little, but for the most part this is a compelling two-hander between Collette and an equally on-form Wolff and both convey well the accumulating fears faced by both as they try to come to terms with a scenario that is being fuelled by something no longer of this world - and one that poor old ""Steve"" is more and more at a loss to know how to cope with. The last fifteen minutes brings in a few hitherto unrevealed threads but rather than frustrate, they prove to be quite clever at knitting the story together.

The kids are all great, Skarsgård makes for a good Pennywise, Pennywise improves as the piece moves forward, and the town is completely believable as ""Derry"" in the '80s. It may not be all it's purported to be, but is a very impressive film on its own merits.

346364,Frank Ochieng,"Something certainly rings true in the horror thriller **It** that capitalizes on that common known fear that clowns are creepy annoyances to those that have an intense phobia towards them. In the case of **It’s** dastardly powder-faced joyboy or shall we say corrosive killjoy Pennywise the Dancing Clown, he definitely takes the cake in terms of his treacherous tendencies to quiet the unsuspecting kiddies in devious fashion. Here is a tip, parents, do not invite the poisonous Pennywise to your kids’ birthday party any time soon to blow up balloons and sing songs. This is just a friendly little warning. There is more to elaborate on regarding the sicko circus funnypants freak later.

Director Andy Muschietti (‘Mama’) delves into this surprisingly delicious twisted and terrorizing tale of a killer clown that gets his jollies off snuffing the lives out of rural-based youngsters in this calculating frightfest that pushes all the right buttons of panic and perversion. Skilfully edgy and traumatically tasty, **It** is a refreshing throwback to old-fashioned gory-minded gems where the boundaries of old-fashioned scare tactics were designed not only by the actual act of homicidal happenings but the mere suggestive nature of the heinous hedonism taking place. Polished and gripping in its shadowy and shifty overtones, **It** is convincingly probing as an absorbing psychological character study with an off-kilter sense of defiance in its naughty commentary on youthful innocence being compromised.

Based on the novel from famed hair-raising author Stephen King, **It** delivers the solid, sordid goods of a wild and wicked imagination following the acidic exploits of a menacing clown in the aforementioned Pennywise (played with penetrating  and devilish aplomb by Bill Skarsgard from ‘Atomic Blonde’) whose murderous methods of slaughtering the young has been a staple signature in his madness for centuries now. The surviving tykes in the quaint town of Derry, Maine must now safeguard themselves from the makeup-wearing whackjob and figure out a way to terminate the baggy-panted beast before he continues to strike again and victimize another doomed child.

The backstory behind Pennywise’s existence is that he is some shape-shifting demon that emerges from the sewers only to target the unlucky rugrat in his immediate path while conniving, and conducting his blood-thirsty ways. However, there are a group of children that refuse to play dead for the demented clown and the quest to create an ill-advised showdown with the deplorable Pennywise would prove to be a very violent and mentally scarring experience in the process.

The story centres around young Bill (Jaeden Lieberher, ‘Allegiant’) and his early encounter with the sadness of unknowingly witnessing Pennywise’s wrath as it was inferred that the clown had to do with the demise of his precious little brother, George (Jackson Robert Scott), who never returned after enthusiastically wanting to work on a fun project in the basement. This haunting revelation sticks with poor Bill until this very day.

Nowadays, Bill must cope with the typical obstacles at school avoiding bullies and dealing with the pitfalls of peer pressure and needing to belong to a group of trusty associates. Thus, Bill is able to cement close relationships with the town’s other free-spirited youngsters. Still, there is that hovering myth about the mysterious sewers and, yes, the evil-minded Pennywise is at the forefront of fearful concern for Bill and the bunch. In fact, the gang will succumb to their collection of fears, paranoia and hesitation as the suburban legend of the creep-seeking clown clouds each of the kids’ tainted psyches.

The ensemble of young actors in **It**  all register accordingly with their characters’ childhood shock in trying to overcome the overwhelming and petrifying mindset that has invaded their sensibilities. Lieberher has an authentic raw turn as the lead lad invested in the bizarre boundaries of matching wits with the demonic chalk-skinned trickster and his committed craziness. The other supporting cast of exposed kiddies on this adventurous train wreck of terror includes Sophia Lillis (’37’), Finn Wolfhard (from television’s ‘Stranger Things’), Jeremy Ray Taylor (‘Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Road Chip’), Wyatt Oleff (‘Guardians Of The Galaxy”), Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer (‘Tales Of Halloween’) and Nicholas Hamilton (‘Captain Fantastic’).

There is no doubt that Skarsgard’s clown of corrosion in Pennywise steals the show with his nefarious nature blistering shamelessly in seedy-minded elation. Clearly, Skarsgard chews the tarnished scenery with his abominable costumed cretin tip toeing on the unassuming sidelines while striking gory goosebump moments for his pubescent prey on screen and the twitchy audience off screen.

Sure, **It** suffers from the conventional trappings of cheesy false alarm jolts and the obligatory lurking in the dark sequences are arbitrarily tossed in as an aftermath for the legitimate lunacy of our star-making crazed and corruptible clown to perform his showboating insanity. Besides, what horror showcase has not welcomed the invitation of the overused and abused jump-scare techniques highlighted by a jittery soundtrack? Still, Muschietti and screenwriters Chase Palmer, Cary Joji Funkunga and Gary Dauberman manage to supply the infectious and insidious **It** with well-executed scary shenanigans, well-paced anxiety, wavering vulnerability and decent acting on behalf of the performers that aptly brought to life the eerie visions and vitality of King’s complex, creative mind.

Truly **It** is one of the best harrowing and in-depth horror/psychological thrillers to emerge in 2017. Also this titillating tale of cautionary kiddie chaos may be one of King’s formidable movie adaptions since the effective tension-filled, off-the-wall brilliance of 1990’s _Misery_.

346364,accioconnor,"It is a movie that looked interesting, but I wasn't necessarily anticipating, because it had the potential to be awful. After seeing it, I can say that while it is good, I don't think it's nearly as good as other people are saying it is, and it had the potential to be. Starting off with the good, the film has some fantastic performances from the kids. I think the best performances in the film are from Andy Skaarsgard (or however you spell it) for Pennywise, and the kid who had asthma. I don't know his name, and I haven't seen him in anything before, but he stole the show. The movie also has some pretty scary moments. The scene inside of the house is one of the scariest scenes of the year, and there are lost of images that were genuinely disturbing. While the films was full of cheesy dialogue, the conversations between the kids are extremely entertaining and captivating. When it came to characters, MOST of the characters are well done and fleshed out. And that leads me to one of the 4 things that keep this film from being great in my eyes. Some characters, such as the bullies and Stan, and bland and have no back story. Therefore, whenever they are put in danger, it isn't nearly as scary as with other characters. Another reason I didn't love this film is the rock fight scene. Basically, the Losers Club stumbles upon the bullies and they throw rocks at each other. The rocks seemingly bounce off of their head without any problems like a trampoline. No one gets killed, or even knocked out. Overall, it was a very bad scene. For the most part the special effects were pretty good. However, the leper outside of the creepy house was awful. The costume would be great if it were for a haunted house or prank, but not for a big budgeted horror movie. When it came on screen I literally thought it was a bully playing tricks on him. And the last problem I have with the film is that the police are seemingly nowhere, along with parents. *Mild spoilers* One of the bullies murders his dad, a police officer, and then around a few scenes later, the son dies too. The bullies like to go around thereatening kids with knives and carving H's into their bellies. I think we would see at least one police officer investegating something in the film, and if not, I think my parents would notice if one day I came home and there was a gigantic blood pool on my shirt. Overall, It is a very fun movie. There are certainly better movies out there, but with this, I have an urge to go watch it again in theaters. It is a perfectly fun popcorn flick.

346364,CinemaSerf,"Every 27 years, the town of Derry experiences sudden, violent and inexplicable mayhem. In 1989, a group of school children rather unkindly called ""The Losers Club"" decide it is for them to investigate just what has happened. Led by ""Bill"" (Jaeden Martell) whose younger brother was a victim, these brave kids are soon on the trail of the shapeshifting ""Pennywise"" - a being from another dimension who frequently takes the shape of a clown. Question is - are these youngsters any match for this lethal and despicable foe? Andy Muschietti has done well here with this film. He manages to combine the more traditional spookiness of the old dark house, with a group of likeable characters who demonstrate the benefits of trust and teamwork as they take on this evil. As with most good horror films, the seemingly invincible must have a weakness, otherwise the plot becomes unsustainable - and this one allows the youngsters to define and exploit this whilst still maintaining enough shock moments and sense of menace to keep the thing interesting. The dialogue isn't the best, but that is not so important here - it's still a really well paced and genuinely scary story that engenders fear from something so outwardly benign as a clown - normally the symbol of joy and happiness.

501170,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

There's this misconceived idea that ""scary movies"" are the ones with demons, monsters, or ghosts literally showing up in jump scare sequences, one after another, accompanied by an extremely loud sound. Granted, we're scared of what we're scared of. No debate here. However, one common complaint about this type of horror films is that they aren't ""scary enough"". I couldn't disagree more. These movies are the ones that truly get to us and stay with us for a while. If we watch a film with cyclical jump scares, we're going to forget about it as soon as we leave the theater. Movies with a horrific story, based on relatable themes, those are the ones that leave us uncomfortable and disturbed. I'm just writing this ""prologue"" to say that you shouldn't go in expecting a ""scary"" film. At least, not in a mainstream way. Moving on...

As you probably know by now (if you don't, check out my The Shining's review), I'm a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name. It's a cult classic horror movie, one that influenced generations to come, especially regarding filmmaking techniques and equipment. With that said, Mike Flanagan had one of the toughest jobs of 2019. Not only did he need to deliver a sequel worthy of being associated with a beloved classic, but he had to deal with all the differences between the source material and Kubrick's changes. I'm going to leave a SPOILER WARNING for The Shining since the film came out 40 years ago, and I already wrote a review about it. Still, SPOILER-FREE for Doctor Sleep, don't worry.

In case you don't know, the major difference between King's book and Kubrick's cinematic adaptation is the ending. In the book, Jack Torrance forgets to relieve the hotel boiler's pressure, and it explodes, destroying the hotel and killing Jack in the process. In Kubrick's movie, Jack freezes to death in the maze outside the hotel while chasing his son, while the hotel stands tall. Flanagan is able to do the impossible: he perfectly continues the story left by Kubrick while respecting King's ""demands"". Just don't go with a ""purist"" mentality, thinking that Flanagan doesn't have the right to explore and expand ""the shining"". It's a sequel, so expect things to be added to the story (nothing is removed or retconned, so relax). As long as it makes sense, be always open to new ideas.

As the director, Flanagan proves once again he's a pretty talented guy by seamlessly recreating some of The Shining's most iconic scenes, but also by delivering some tricks of his own. With the help of his amazing cinematographer, Michael Fimognari, they are able to generate incredible levels of tension, characteristic of the original film. As the editor, he puts together everything remarkably well. The sequences inside someone's mind are wonderfully handled and provide some of the best moments of the entire movie. However, there's a massive difference when it comes to how the runtime flows in each film.

Both cross the 140-minute mark, and both purposefully employ slow pacing. Nevertheless, The Shining feels like it goes by way faster than Doctor Sleep (and mathematically it does have less 5-10 minutes, but that's not the point). Why? Due to Kubrick's movie constantly having long takes and extense dialogues, while Flanagan's installment has a modern approach with regular cuts plus much more action. Audiences presumably won't think of this (it's not like the ""average Joe"" notices or even cares if a scene has been going for 5 minutes straight or pieced together with 50 cuts), and just assume that the latter is more boring than the first without really understanding why.

People will probably blindly blame the story, but Doctor Sleep has a lot more ""blockbuster entertainment"" than The Shining. The latter is pretty much two hours spent inside a hotel where dialogue is the primary source of entertainment (things only go crazy in the last 15-20 minutes), and we all know that the general public usually doesn't fall for that. The sequel has a lot more action, subplots, and characters, so the runtime should go by faster than the original, right? No. This film is the number one proof that I'm going to use from now on to defend that uncut dialogue sequences and overall long takes are the best way of managing an extended runtime without it feeling too ""heavy"", especially in a psychological horror flick.

I wrote all these last paragraphs not to complain about the movie's being too slow, too long, or too dull. I'm just trying to help everyone understand why the film might feel slower and (much) longer, while protecting its story because the screenplay is indeed extremely well-written. Like in the original, exposition is handled beautifully with scarce lazy displays, but it's the characters of Ewan McGregor and the debutant Kyliegh Curran that carry the narrative effortlessly. McGregor is the perfect casting as Danny Torrance, and he does a great job of embodying Dan's personality. However, it's Danny's journey through his young and adult years that impresses me.

Exceptional character development! Danny's life after the events at the Overlook Hotel is as realistic and logical as it could be. Flanagan does a phenomenal job in handling this character and throwing just the right obstacles in his path. The way he deals with the aftermath of The Shining, how he grows up as a man, and even what he ends up doing for a living, everything is absolutely perfect. Furthermore, he's not alone. Abra is a badass young girl who wants to use her ""shine"" to protect others, but this time it's the actress that steals the spotlight from the character. Kyliegh Curran delivers one of the best young acting debuts I've ever witnessed. She's wonderful as Abra, and her range of emotions is already surprisingly vast.

She has some of the best scenes of the movie, especially when she's ""fighting"" Rose the Hat, but here is where we get to my major issue with the film. Rebecca Ferguson gives an outstanding performance, no doubt about it. She elevates infinite sequences, giving 200% to her role. However, her character and The True Knot group are the only significant flaw of this sequel. When writing a villain, there are basically two paths for success: either make the ""bad guy"" a compelling character with whom the audience can create some sort of empathy with and understand where he/she comes from, or turn him/her into a menacing, powerful, scary force that makes us fear for our heroes.

Flanagan apparently chooses the latter route, and unfortunately, it's his only misstep. I don't know if King didn't allow for changes to Rose or The True Knot cult, but they don't quite work when adapting to the big screen. Not only their history is never truly explored, but their motivations are too shallow, so I didn't care for a single character from the group, not even Rose. If she was the ""menacing, powerful, scary force"" that I wrote above, this wouldn't be so important, but the truth is she isn't. As the narrative progresses, there's a constant reminder that our heroes are in danger and that Rose is astonishingly strong, but the interactions between her and Abra prove the contrary. So, I never really felt frightened or overwhelmed by her.

A decent portion of runtime is handed to Rose's group, but its development didn't work for me at all. They're not bad villains, and they're still more fleshed out that a lot of characters in horror movies. I just think something's missing. Nevertheless, that's the only major problem I have with the movie. For true fans of The Shining, the countless references and Easter Eggs are such a delight (there's good and bad fan-service, the one present in this sequel only appears after we are already invested in the story and its characters, demonstrating once more Flanagan's talent). From the haunting and addictive score that The Newton Brothers are able to seamlessly adapt to the sequel to the influential Kubrick's framing, Flanagan and his team produce something pretty extraordinary having in mind this is a sequel to one of the most beloved horror films of all-time.

In the end, Doctor Sleep might be the first sequel/remake/reboot/whatever to a cult classic movie that doesn't diminish the original, disgracefully copies it or takes something away from it, while actually being an individually great film with a captivating narrative and compelling leads, plus the right amount of homages to the classic. Mike Flanagan took the impossible task of balancing both Stephen King's The Shining and Stanley Kubrick's cinematic adaptation, and successfully nailed pretty much everything regarding the connection between the main stories. In addition to the slow pacing not working as well as in the original, The True Knot group is the big stumble in an otherwise pretty consistent screenplay. However, the phenomenal cast (with a terrific debut performance from Kyliegh Curran) elevate every scene, ultimately driving the sequel to a nostalgia-full ending that will turn out to be divisive among fans. I stand on the good side. Therefore, I genuinely appreciate this movie. If you're a fan of the original, you can't miss this one!

It’s a fun supernatural horror film aided by fantastic performances by Ferguson and Curran.

501170,The Movie Diorama,"Doctor Sleep may not diagnose you to the land of nod, but tediously drains your shining spirit. Director Mike Flanagan had an unfathomable task. To both adapt a Stephen King novel, which is no easy achievement considering his uniquely descriptive writing style, and provide a sequel to what many describe as “the greatest horror film of all-time”. Quenching the thirst of King’s avid readers and cinephiles alike. So even without divulging my own opinion on Doctor Sleep, applause must be given for just producing this feature. That, unfortunately for Flanagan, doesn’t result in myself excusing specific inexcusable filmmaking tendencies that taint, not just Doctor Sleep, but various decaying intellectual properties that have been unnecessarily drudged up again.

An alcoholic scarred Dan Torrance, having endured the irrevocable dangers of the Overlook Hotel (‘The Shining’), has his peace shattered when he encounters a young extrasensory girl whom is being hunted down by shine-draining monsters.

First and foremost, I have not read the novel, although this should not come as a surprise. I have however, watched ‘The Shining’ multiple times. Now, what promotes the aforementioned horror as the best of its kind, is legendary Stanley Kubrick using the essence of King’s novel and essentially making his own iteration of it. One that the renowned supernatural writer still, to this day, has mixed emotions for. So for Flanagan to introduce some faithful interpretations of Doctor Sleep, whilst maintaining the cinematic endeavour that Kubrick meticulously crafted, is as I said, unfathomable. And there’s a perfectly valid reason for that. The overtly supernatural strands of the novels do not complement the genesis of terror from Kubrick’s film. Which is why, with great regret, I have to report that Doctor Sleep does not work. It doesn’t.

A beastly behemoth that, whilst does stand on its own two legs, relies on heavy-handed storytelling techniques and nostalgia to tackle both mediums that inspired it. In tonality, they are irrefutably different from each other. But before the disappointing third act is tackled, let’s address some positives first.

Doctor Sleep is a shining example of depicting childhood trauma and how fragmented coping mechanisms are embedded throughout adulthood. Young Danny imaginatively designs mental traps so that he can hold the starving ghosts from the Overlook in captivity. Yet that wilful mentality does not prevent him from suffering with alcoholism, substance abuse and an insalubrious lifestyle that masquerades the trauma instead of curing it. Thematically, this is powerful, and grants the narrative a solid cohesion throughout. For the first two hours, you subconsciously warm to Danny due to the tormenting fears he has established throughout the two films. He’s a pillar of “the shining”. McGregor consistently captivated by depicting a fragile mentality through a physically demanding performance, maintaining the entranced demeanour of his younger character.

The first hour, that heavily explained “the shining” and the intentions of the merciless antagonists The True Knot, experienced inconsistent tones due to the mass sprawl of locational change. One minute we’re in a sleepy town, the next a woodland area, and then all of a sudden eight years have been and gone. The zippy nature of the editing and bloated exposition resulted in atmospheric terror being abolished. The tension was non-existent, and the imitation of Kubrick’s directing style paled in comparison.

Then, the second hour commenced, which is by far one of the strongest acts the year has yet to offer. Flanagan retained a surprisingly dark tone that, was so shocking, forced audience members to leave the auditorium. The mind-space of Abra, a precocious teenager who has “shine”, produced a transcendental imaginative battle against Rose the Hat, leader of The True Knot. Ferguson, who portrayed the primary antagonist, was sensational. Equalling the likes of Pennywise as one of the most enthralling King villains ever depicted. Sinister, unrelenting and bordering on near-lunacy. Controlling every scene from just her eyes alone, she enhanced the palpable tension. She made the second act. In fact, she made the film. The interjecting gore and darkness throughout the middling act abruptly astonished me, and settled for a direction that I thought would control the underwhelming first act.

The third act then arrives, and the entire story crumbles much like the Overlook itself. Plagued by an overshadowing sickness that ‘The Shining’ had produced. Nostalgia. Remember that time where Jack viciously chopped the bedroom door down with an axe? Or that moment where blood came hurtling through the hallways in slow motion? What about Room 237? The introductory swooping camera movement that Kubrick embraced whilst the Torrance’s drove to the hotel? The typewriter? Slowly walking up the stairs in a confrontational manner? The snow-covered hedge maze? The twins? No? You don’t remember? Flanagan has got you covered. Nostalgia is a powerful tool, yet it must be handled with delicacy. The difference between imitating and homaging is very fine, and unfortunately Flanagan settled for the former.

So much of ‘The Shining’ is replicated in the third act, scene for scene, that it was a near-identical copy without the textual substance that accompanied them originally. The re-casting of the original actors, despite Essoe bettering Duvall’s performance (although not difficult), felt unnecessary. Almost tarnishing ‘The Shining’ in itself. Danny walking through the dilapidated hallways for ten minutes whilst Flanagan incorporates identical sequences, had no purpose other than to forcefully remind you that this is the sequel. Literarily, it never progresses Danny’s character or the plot. Rose the Hat staring at the blood-spewing elevators? Pointless. Danny staring at an axe encased in glass? A suitable nod to its predecessor. Do you see the difference? Between imitation and homage? The third act was littered with falsified copies, preying on the nostalgia of fans. It’s uninspired. It’s mundane. And it made me a dull boy.

Creatively, Doctor Sleep managed to infuse the very best of its adapted novel and preceding feature, but embellished the very worst techniques when conveying the plot. Psychologically stimulating without installing dread. Extrasensory without testing the senses. Dimly shining amongst King’s supernatural adaptations.",2020-01-16T14:24:26.760Z,6.0,Doctor Sleep,2019
501170,Matthew Brady,"“Hi there”

Hello there...

Mike Flanagan has some of the biggest balls in the horror industry. I mean just look at his filmography so far.

He took one of the worst horror movies in recent memory ‘Ouija’ and said: “yeah, I wanna make a sequel to that”, with ‘Ouija: Origin of Evil’ and somehow made it less terrible. How about ‘Haunting of Hill House’ where he’s going to direct every episode of a television series that has to weave two narratives together at once over ten episodes...and again he somehow made it work. And now this guy is gonna make a sequel to one of the most revered horror movies of all time with ‘Doctor Sleep’...the son of b**ch did it again!

I think Flanagan deserves more credit as a director rather than people bitching that his movies “ain't scary enough an-” blah blah blah shut the hell up.

‘Doctor Sleep’ was a complete surprise for all the right reasons. At first I wasn’t sure if the movie would hook me, because it takes awhile for it to get going, but slowly I got invested in the story and the characters. There have been four Stephen King movie adaptions this year: ‘Pet Sematary’, ‘IT Chapter Two’, ‘In The Tall Grass’, and now this movie. This is by far the best out of them all.

The runtime is 152 minutes long and I can safely say that the movie is 85% it’s own thing, because it doesn't just rely on nostalgia to tell their story and it’s only the last act where things start to play on nostalgia when the characters return to the Overlook Hotel. The nostalgia being the 80’s horror classic of course. It’s either that or 97 TV mini-series. Who’s got fond memories for that piece of sh*t? So with this being both a sequel to Kubrick's movie and King’s original novel; a clash of visions coming together with Flanagan trying to put this together, while also applying his own vision into the mix.

Now that’s hard.

The part that got me invested in the story was the scene between Danny and a elderly patient who’s on their death bed. Danny comforts them as their peacefully past away, without dying alone. It’s a beautiful and heartfelt scene that you would never expect to see in a supernatural horror movie.

Ewan Mcgregor was fantastic as an alcoholic grown-up Danny Torrance. Nicholson's presence was felt through out the movie as adult Danny fears he might follow in his fathers footsteps. There’s a scene where Danny gives a talk at a rehab group and as doing so he reflects deeply on everything that happened to him in the past, while the camera is locked on Ewan’s face. Not only from his childhood, but everything afterwards and drowning out the trauma through drinking - something that us as the audience don’t see. I thought he was excellent. He absolutely “shines” as the character...and am not sorry for that pun.

I loved how fleshed out the villains were, which surprised me the most about the movie. They are like vampires, but instead of feasting on blood, it’s “the shining” they crave for a expanded life. Casual and charming, and yet wickedly evil. There’s a particularly scene that was so difficult to watch and really got under my skin. However you do get to see them interreacting with each other in normal conversations as they casually go on with the day and work as a group. Rose the Hat sticks out from the rest as a sinister and endearing villian played marvelously by Rebecca Ferguson.

Mike Flanagan dose a great job on balancing both Kubrick’s and King’s version respectfully, but also manages to put his visual spin in. The one thing that hasn’t been mention yet is how great he is with child actors as he always gets the best performance out of them, especially Jacob Tremblay and Kyliegh Curran who was so convincing in the roles it was scary.

The movie looks stunning with the use of colors adding to the overall tone and helps creates the horror atmosphere. Same thing with the score that while it takes samples from Kubrick’s movie, but not to say it doesn’t have it’s own.

For issues:

There was a couple of callbacks that was a little on the noise, usually through references. As I said early the movie takes a while to find it’s footing and you couldn’t help but draw comparisons. There were a few questionable and almost silly lines that King himself would inject into his work for humor, but here, with tone in mind, just took the fear out of it.

However, the movie is far too long with probably 15-20 minutes that could've gotten the axe (so to speak), and the plot was The Shining meets X-Men with some Monsters Inc thrown in for good measure.

Didn't hate it at all, but not sure I have much desire to revisit, though I have to wonder what else they threw in there with the 3-hour long Director's Cut. **3.0/5**",2020-02-18T22:54:12.821Z,6.0,Doctor Sleep,2019
501170,Kamurai,"Fantastic watch, will watch again, and do recommend.

I honestly wasn't excited about this one, so my expectations were low.  I didn't realize it was Stephen King, let alone a sequel to ""The Shining"" until I watched it.  I'm also not a big fan of ""The Shining"", but I haven't watched it since I learned to watch a movie critically.

After hearing about ""shining"" from everyone, I immediately got excited when I realize that was what this movie was all about.  I've been waiting for this movie since ""Push"".  This movie is honestly what ""Star Wars: Episode I"" should have been.  This is how you give an explanation of how super powers work on a large scale: you tell a story that examples it, ""do not say"", it is how movies are supposed to work.

This was wonderfully casted: Ewan McGregor, Kyliegh Curran, and Rebecca Ferguson are amazing.  There deliveries have weight to them, and it really makes the movie.

The production value is fantastic, they definitely didn't spare a cent to make this look as good or nostalgic as it needed to be.

There are aspects of the story I think we could have done without, mostly just for time purposes, and there are portions of the story that are just gratuitously graphic, and some of those two things overlap, but I'm not going to say that any of the movie would actually be better for it.  The story, whether it be the movie or from the book, is exceedingly well paced, and powerful, every step of the way.

It has this wonderful theme of predators and prey, basically ""There's always a bigger fish"", but in a twisted, looping way.

501170,GenerationofSwine,"The problem here is that they made a sequel to the 1980 movie... and not a sequel to King's book.

And, let's be honest, as good as Stanley's film was, it really had little to do with Kings novel. Almost The Shining in name only. So many changes were made, right down to the theme, that it barely resembled the book.

So, when they made the sequel to the movie, and not the novel, a lot of the elements that made the Doctor Sleep compelling, a lot of the plot points, and a lot of the twists and turns that made the novel worth reading had to be changed in order to keep continuity with Kubrick's changes.

The result is really kind of a mess. So much of what Doctor Sleep was referenced back to The Shining, the novel, that trying to adapt the script to the Kubrick film was, honestly, a mistake.

In the end, it grasps at straws and never finds a footing, making Doctor Sleep even further removed from the story it was based on than Kubrick's film was... with far less talent directing it.",2023-01-11T01:00:11.882Z,1.0,Doctor Sleep,2019
924,John Chard,"Come on, man. You must've heard the priest say something about life and death.

George Romero fans feared the worst, another one of his sacred original zombie trilogy films was being remade, this even though the remake of Night of the Living Dead didn't disgrace itself. As it happened, the fears were unfounded, for Zack Snyder and his team crafted one of the best horror remakes going.

The premise follows Romero's wonderful version, a mysterious epidemic is causing the populace to turn into undead zombies, the bite of which transfers the illness to another. A small group of survivors make it to the Crossroads Mall and hole up there whilst trying to keep at bay the zombie hordes, but inner fighting threatens the group whilst they know they can't stay there for ever.

Right from the off the film grabs you around the throat, it's a blistering and terrifying opening which brings heartbreak and terror in equal measure. It also announces to us that these zombies are different to Romero's, these suckers can run, and run fast. After some chaos and blood, the introductions to our survivors is set up and the pic settles into a superb group dynamic situation, where machismo and brains meet dumb and dumber, all while little devilish moments trickle away in the background.

It's the focus on the survivors that really lifts it to greater heights, how they variously react to their plight, there's good thought gone into the screenplay (James Gunn). The natural progression of this type of film calls for horror moments, and Snyder deftly slots them in when the pic needs them, which again brings about scenes of terror and genuine heartbreaking moments. Some neat cameos will be cheered by fans of Romero's work, while the cast are superb here, with Sarah Polley the standout fulfilling the believable promise of the character as written.

A remake that is its own beast yet still pays homage to what inspired it, and good at both! Now that's a rare thing in horror! 8/10",2015-10-21T20:30:14.678Z,8.0,Dawn of the Dead,2004
924,Kamurai,"Great watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend.

Granted, if you're not a zombie fan, you're probably not even considering this one.  Then you have the great argument about infection vectors (this is pretty classic, bite infection transfer), and slow vs fast (this movie is fast) zombies.  I'm basically just pointing out why we can't have nice things, people argue about it.

This has a great cast: Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley and Jake Weber in particular.  The production value was definitely present, and not just in renting a mall to trash, or even just the zombie practical effects.

The large scale scenes look amazing, and the details on the various infections are fascinating to watch.  And sure, there is lots of quality gunfire (foley is good) and shooting zombies for people you are just in it for the action.  While it's actually got some good (if dark at times) humor to it, it's not ""Warm Bodies"".

Of course the presence of zombies / apocalyptic situation / lack of central authority gives us great philosophical opportunity to discuss what life means and see how people behave, but this leans more towards survival strategy aspects.

If anything, I think that is where the ""flaw"" is in this movie: (most of) the characters are relatively competent so it detours some from typical movie formula relying on the characters to make mistakes to progress the story, but more of there is just a hopeless unending storm of bad things happening to them, it's honestly a little refreshing.

924,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A low-budget film, but where everyone tries to do the best they can.**

Generally, I don't like films with the living dead, although I've seen several in recent times. This was one of them. Out of nowhere, the characters are thrown into a total apocalypse where people become zombies that they don't know how to kill. The protagonist is a young nurse, who immediately loses her entire family in the first moment. That makes us instantly like her. From then on, we hope that she will save herself and find other survivors to form an alliance with, which inevitably happens when she finds a shopping mall.

Zack Snyder directs this film and delivers a very competent and well-made story, which manages to captivate the audience with a convincing and structured story. The film is, moreover, a remake of an original by George A. Romero, but it is really worth seeing this film for what it is, without comparisons. Technically, the film was well edited and has good sets, costumes and makeup, and a pleasantly stable pace that doesn't leave us thinking about things too much. Of course, there are obvious clichés and logical flaws in all of this, such as the fact that some things never stop working (running water, electricity, etc.), but I forgave these problems.

The cast doesn't have any particularly big names, perhaps it was a conscious and deliberate decision to make this film with lesser-known actors, with whom everyone could identify more easily. Sarah Polley is the protagonist and does a very decent job, as do Ving Rhames and Michael Kelly. It is noted, however, that the entire film was made with very low budgets and that there is some amateurism and improvisation in the work of the cast and technical team. Still, weighing things up, it's not a bad film and everyone did the best they could do.",2024-06-02T06:12:31.417Z,4.0,Dawn of the Dead,2004
609,Ted Fraraccio,"One of the biggest moments of my childhood was seeing _Poltergeist_ for the first time at 7 years old. I saw it on a 4:3 set on a very old DVD in my parents' bedroom, after my mom had recently come home from the hospital after surgery. One night, my dad came home from the library with some DVDs, and one of them was _Poltergeist_.
I popped it into the DVD player without hesitation as I'd wanted to see it since I was 5. I knew from the moment it started, _Poltergeist_ was going to be a great movie, but little did I know it would become my favorite movie of all time, and I'd want to experience it again and again.
Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams star in this classic as Steve and Diane Freeling, who live with their three children, 16-year-old Dana (Dominique Dunne), 8-year-old Robbie (Oliver Robins), and 5-year-old Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) in Cuesta Verde, CA, soon learn that their home is haunted, and that the spirits talk to Carol Anne through their television. Everything seem normal at first. Dana gives construction workers the finger and talks on the phone later than she's supposed to, Robbie is a huge Star Wars fan, and Carol Anne feeds her goldfish an entire tube of food. One night, a tree tries to eat Robbie, but they quickly save him. When the ghosts kidnap Carol Anne through the closet, they are forced to fight the evil spirit that holds their daughter if they ever want to see her again.
Well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, with great special effects, _Poltergeist_ is, in my opinion, the greatest ghost story of all time. Let's start with the acting. The way lines are said, the facial expressions, body language, everything about the characters feels real. Craig T. Nelson's performance as Steve is the most real dad in a movie I've ever seen. JoBeth Williams' performance as Diane is the most real mom in a movie I've ever seen. Heather O'Rourke gives the best performance by a 5-year-old I've ever seen. Zelda Rubinstein is also great. It doesn't even seem like they're acting. The performances are top-notch.
The special effects still hold up, because they still look real.
The plot is still _very_ original, because it's set in modern suburban America, and it's about a normal family that loves each other, rather than an abusive husband and father.
_Poltergeist_ is so well-written that nobody has to die, nor does it have to be gory to keep us on the edge of our seats.
Hooper and Spielberg keep it subtle by hardly showing the ghosts.
_Poltergeist_ features a great plot, great acting, great directing, and great writing. I can't recommend _Poltergeist_ enough. _Poltergeist_ **is** a kid's movie, so it's not all that scary, though there are scenes that may scare you or creep you out, but you won't be scarred for life. In the end it really is a fun thrill ride. It's a movie every kid must see by the time they're 8 years old. For some reason, I find myself trying, sometimes unsuccessfully, to hold back tears every time I see it.
_Poltergeist_ is my favorite movie of all time, it truly is a great classic, and it still holds up after over 30 years as its message is still relevant today. _Poltergeist_ tells the story of a family nothing can tear apart. It's a classic good versus evil story, a story of perseverance in spite of your worst fears coming to light, and holding it together in spite of everything seeming to fall apart. It's about never giving up hope. When I watched Craig T. Nelson, I saw my dad on that screen, and I see him on that screen even more now. When I watched JoBeth Williams, I saw my mom on that screen, and I see her on that screen even more now. Your experience might not be exactly like this, but there's no denying that this movie is awesome. I know you're probably worried because of things you've read online about it being scary, gory, or boring, but don't be. The violence is never gory. The occasional cursing never gets too bad. Despite everything that happens, there's a sense of hope that stays the entire movie. Let your kids see it. They'll thank you.",2014-03-27T21:21:06.781Z,10.0,Poltergeist,1982
609,John Chard,"We know it as the beast.

The Freeling family are happy and functioning perfectly well until one night their youngest daughter announces that thru the TV, the supernatural are here!

Poltergeist divides the horror crowd big time, the gore fans are simply not impressed by the events in the film, while ghostly supernatural fans such as myself see it as a wasted opportunity. But strip away the flashy production and you start to see the core joke of kids infatuation with the goggle box, so yes, the film could easily be titled under the banner of being a Black Comedy. But be that as it may, and lets not be under any illusions here that, Poltergeist is not a knowing wink wink horror film of substance, the film really could have been a truly terrifying piece of work to cater for all tastes, and I firmly believe that that was the main intention of the makers from the off.

Thus lies the chief problems with Poltergeist, it tries so hard to cover all bases it gets that confused to the point it veers from tedium to shock and back again before you have time to digest, and it kills what should have been a genre masterpiece. There are moments in the film that chill the blood, the sense of creeping menace hangs heavy during a storm, a toy clown becomes evil personified just by being lit in the stormy light, and then? Well it violently switches to something involving a tree that wouldn't be fit for Creepshow 27! On the film goes, suspense with chairs and pieces of meat, and then BAM...monster time! It just doesn't work, it's a collage of genre splicing that both director Tobe Hooper & producer Steven Spielberg are firmly to be held responsible for, because it's obvious that both their signature's clash to create an uneasy bedfellow.

Yet as uneven as it is, and as blatantly plagiarised as it is of Twilight Zone episode Little Girl Lost, I still find myself enjoying watching Poltergeist, with its slick production and some memorable moments; the clown, poor darling Heather O'Rourke saying ""they're here"", the first chair sequence, and the always creepy Mrs. Tuthill, all things that help to make it a frustratingly enjoyable nights viewing. 6/10

Unlike some of my contemporaries, I'm very split on this film. As a fan of the genre, horror always intrigues me, even when it's done poorly/reuses the tired tropes. When rewatching _Poltergeist_ for what seems to be the twentieth time - now in my early twenties - the movie seems dated, to the point where what made it bone-chilling in the first place, seems calm and a little ridiculous. Perhaps I'm desensitized to this type of movie. Perhaps I'll appreciate it more when I do have a family, when I _am_ Craig T. Nelson. But currently, the film struggles against its pacing, unconvincing effects (see scene in the children's room where the closet tries to vacuum them up, and the ""face"" scene - you'll know), and the nature of it attempting to be both family friendly and a horror movie. Sustained over the years since its release, however, are the performances by the cast, specifically the parents.

Jamie Campbell Bower also delivers well amongst a supporting cast of solid British stage talent - a rather menacing Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall amongst them. It is dark and gritty, and stays fairly faithful to the theatrical performance that impresses not just with it's solid performances (perhaps not so much with Johnny Depp who comes across as eerily uncomfortable) but with the super costume and make-up effects, the lighting and, of course, a score that marries cleverly the threatening with the frequent (very black) humour.

Admittedly, the film isn't particularly scary as it seeks to poke fun at more serious alien critter movies of the time. Still, its creepy atmosphere and twisted little monsters, mixed with the holiday cheer and quaintness of the quiet small town of Kingston Falls, set it apart from other 80s creature features. For many, sitting around the Christmas tree, sipping hot chocolate, and watching Gremlins is a yearly tradition. It might be a little dated, but Gremlins is a fun, adventurous film unlike any other Christmas movie.",2022-09-16T16:02:17.024Z,8.0,Gremlins,1984

It's quite good fun this, at the start, but as it progresses the joke wears a bit thin and the mayhem just a little too slapstick for me.

259693,Reno,"**This time a London family struggle in their haunted house.**

First of all, I am not a big fan of the first film, but I liked that. Now this sequel was not bad either. This time it takes us to the London. But the film reminded me the 80s film 'Poltergeist', particularly the second part. So don't assume it is exactly the same, only the scenes involving house seems similar, but the story was different. It is another true story based film, that's what they said in the opening statement. You're not forced to believe that, if you're here for an entertainment, you will get that if you put your logics away for the two hours.

A family of four young children and their mother living in a house in the London witness some serious paranormal activities lately. Particularly the eleven year old girl affected the most with the spirit the house possessed. So the American couple from the first film are brought in to do their best to help the family. When they try to contact the spirit, they won't get what they were looking for. Instead, an unexpected blame goes for the girl and soon the family loses confidence in them. The overcoming those misunderstanding, particularly realising the truth brings a twist before concluding the tale.

The one twenty minute never looked too long. Because there's always something keeps happening, so the audience to keep engaged with. Probably this is won't be your best horror film of the years, but being a horror themed film, it had good form of those contents. Not too scary, at a time those clichés were used in a good way to bring freshness in the scenes. I will credit the writers for that. Besides, the actors were undoubtedly good, including those little ones. For me this is a better horror film and I definitely look for another sequel. I hope this one would stand up to your expectations.

259693,Sheldon Nylander,"I'm giving this half a star more than I gave the first movie. As a horror film in its own rite, it's competently made, although somewhat predictable as it follows most of the traditional haunted house film tropes. But it is better than the first one in that it's a more cohesive film, with such corrections as how the background ""monster"" actually does play a part in the story, whereas in the first film Annabelle was shoehorned in but had nothing to do with the main story and served only as a distraction.

Ultimately, the reason I can't rate this film higher is because it's about the Warrens, who were a couple of charlatans that took advantage of vulnerable and desperate people. While this is touched on briefly, it's done more in the context of people who don't believe them are all mean and unsympathetic.

259693,r96sk,"<em>'The Conjuring 2'</em>, oof. What a chore to sit through. The only redeeming quality I have for this film is Madison Wolfe's performance as Janet, which is fairly impressive for a youngster. That aside, I have nothing that I can praise or even mark as better than mid, sadly.

The 2hr+ run time obviously doesn't help, but that actually isn't even a major negative for this movie. The plot, which feels like a rehash of the 2013 original in most (if not all) areas, is just so bloated and boring, I initially thought the English-ify of the story would bring freshness but, aside from the amusingly bad cockney accents, it's barely noticeable when in yet another dingy house.

<b>[bit of a spoiler on the way]</b>

The demons felt like a drop-off from the first flick, I admit the Bill character turned out to be a tiny bit more interesting than I thought it was going to be early on. Even then, I wanted a little bit of resolution with Bill once 'the end' happens (with Anita too). Unless it happened and I was already mentally zoned out by then, possible I guess?

I think another thing that affects my enjoyment is the lack of jeopardy for the human characters, once is fine but back-to-back? Like they put all the pieces in place to kill one of them off and then just bottle it right at the last minute; this one here, for example, would've been very meaningful too. That dog in the original must feel extremely hard done by, ought to sue thy agent. I suppose it needs to cling to the ""true event"" (lol).

259693,CinemaSerf,"This second cinema outing for the ghost-busting Warren’s takes them to London’s northern district of Enfield where the Hodgson family are having a fairly torrid time. Younger daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe) and her elder sister Margaret (Lauren Esposito) have been pining for their absent father and so rather optimistically consult a home-made ouija board to find out if he is ever going to return home again! Their mum Peggy (Frances O’Connor) and the audience know that he’s shacked up with a woman round the corner with their new set of twins. Anyway, Janet goes to sleep and that’s the beginning of their nightmare as an old gent (Bill) who reputedly died in an armchair in the house decides to revisit the family, rearrange the furniture, change the television channels and generally cause mayhem for this cash-strapped family. Meantime, Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) has been painting a fetching portrait of a nun (think the art-loving Sister Wendy Beckett from the mid-1990s) who seems to be the source of some discomfort for wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga). Might these two mysteries be connected? Well the church asks the pair to do some surreptitious investigations in the UK and so off they go. Of course they are sceptical, but when a bit of levitation creeps in, the doors start to slam of their own accord and the water supply seems intent on building them an indoor swimming pool in the basement, they begin to wonder if Janet et al are really hoaxers, or might there actually be something altogether more malevolent at work here. According to local sources here, the Warren’s spent hardly any time at all at the house and so much of the substance to this story is unsubstantiated conjecture, but James Wan still manages to create something plausibly scary as these children and their mother - at her wits end - try to deal with this unwelcome phenomena. It’s end-to-end stuff with the girls also delivering spookily (and shriekingly) as the shadows come alive with well-mixed audio effects and some false teeth with a mind of their own. Wilson and Farmiga over-egg their earnestness a bit at times, but as the “McMillan and Wife” of the occult, they do well enough to send the odd tingle up and down your spine.

2668,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"et us get this over with right away. I do not think Johnny Depp was the right person for playing Ichabod Crane. Maybe I am too influenced by seeing him in Pirates of The Caribbean but I just do not think he was the right person for this role. He really did not work for me. He is to whimsical and gesticulating to be taken seriously as a scientifically inclined crime investigator as far as I am concerned.

Too bad since the story itself and the movie was quite promising. As is often the case with Tim Burton’s work the movie has quite dark tone which I quite like. The various scruffy and suspicious characters that Ichabod meets right away as he enters the village inn fits right into the eerie atmosphere.

Unfortunately Ichabod’s inclination for science clashes with the rest of the story which is undoubtedly supernatural. It makes the movie not really have a distinct direction but instead waddle with one foot in each camp. I would have preferred if the movie either had gone all science and in the end Ichabod had exposed an evil but perfectly human adversary by scientific means or if it had gone all supernatural and Ichabod was an adept at exposing (exorcising) supernatural beings rather than a scientist.

Having said that, the movie was still a decent enough evening flick and fairly enjoyable. The footage and scenery are well done as one would expect from Tim Burton. It is not exactly a special effects loaded movie but what is there is fairly okay, at least for a movie from 1999.",2014-05-27T08:31:49.159Z,6.0,Sleepy Hollow,1999
2668,John Chard,"It is you, Ichabod Crane, who is now put to the test.

Sleepy Hollow is directed by Tim Burton and co-adapted to screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and Kevin Yagher from the The Legend of Sleepy Hollow written by Washington Irving. It stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Marc Pickering, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones and Casper Van Dien. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki.

1799 New York, and Ichabod Crane, a timid but forward thinking detective, is sent to the way out village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a number of decapitations.

A perfect match of director and actor to the source material, Sleepy Hollow unfolds as a fun filled creeper of such visual and aural pleasures, it's a wonder nobody thought to put the combination together earlier than 1999. Story is familiar, though with a few changes, and although some of the comedy ends up a bit sillier than is tonally appropriate (really, Ichabod, stop pushing the effeminate angle to breaking point), film runs along at a fair old clip and never wants for period devilment. It's never really scary when Walken's headless horseman isn't part of the scene, but it's very unlikely that Burton or Depp were aiming to soil underwear anyway. More a case of charming you whilst caressing the tingler on your spine. A case of style of substance? Yes, to a degree, but the source story still comes through the lavish eye candy painting to reveal itself proudly.

Burton had created a world of Gothic mysticism, a blend of Hammer horror values and Brothers Grimm bad dreams, a land of swirling mists and tall shadows, where black, red and purple are essential colours. From the quaint duck pond in the centre of the village, to a creaky old windmill, there are visual treats galore here - which are enhanced magnificently by Elfman's foreboding rumbles. Costuming is first rate (Colleen Atwood), as is Lubezki's colour lensing and Rick Heinrich's production design. The cast are led superbly by Depp and appear to be pitching performances at just the right tone, such is the director's want. Although Ricci is sadly underused in a key role, and we could have done with more Richardson since she is wonderfully catty and yummy in equal measure. But with bona fide thespian quality in the support ranks (joining Gambon and Jones are Michael Gough, Ian McDiarmid and Richard Griffiths), picture never falls short of scene enhancers.

Period peril with a glint in its eye, Sleepy Hollow is a delightful nights entertainment by the fire. 8/10",2019-05-07T07:19:21.302Z,8.0,Sleepy Hollow,1999
2668,Kamurai,"Decent watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

While Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci do carry quite a bit of the movie, there is quite a lot else going on here.  The horseman does tend to dominate much of this story as the original does.

I don't feel there was much to the original fable of the Headless Horseman so pretty much any take you do on it seems fine: though maybe an Easter Bunny version would push some boundaries.

This is about as weird, but more because it has to create a weird atmosphere, then add Depp doing weirder stuff than the weird people can handle, despite believing in ghosts which he all but fights with them about.  Ichabod Crane being a smart, if cowardly, constable is interesting as he literally has the ""hero"" role painted on him.

This is surprisingly more of a mystery than any other type of movie.  The action is usually intense and brief when it happens, and much of the movie is spent looking for rational explanations until ocom's razor wins out.

This is a good movie and a decent mystery, but I do feel it's just awkward in too many cases for most people to be on board.

I expect Headless Horsemen and mystery fans to enjoy this though.",2020-08-02T05:42:48.503Z,6.0,Sleepy Hollow,1999
2668,Wuchak,"_**Great Spooky Flick for the Fall Season!**_

""Sleepy Hollow"" is Tim Burton's stylish 1999 take on Washington Irving's classic tale about Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman starring Johnny Depp as Crane and Christopher Walken as the Hessian horseman. The story is set in 1799 and involves Crane, a constable from New York City, going to the Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of gruesome murders where the victims are decapitated.

Whether you like Burton's films or not, who can deny his talent for visuals and overall production? This guy knows how to make a film LOOK good, that's for sure. As for Depp, he portrays sleuth Ichabod in a very human manner, e.g. he's afraid of spiders and amusingly passes out on occasion.

There are four things that really impress me about this picture besides Depp: (1) I love the spooky Fall atmosphere; it obviously takes place sometime in gloomy November. (2) I always thought the concept of the headless horseman was insipid, but ""Sleepy Hollow"" depicts him (it) in such a horrific/supernatural fashion that he's actually scary, not to mention skilled with weaponry and virtually unstoppable. I wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley, or anywhere else for that matter! (3) Miranda Richardson was almost 41 at the time of filming, but -- man -- is she gorgeous! Nuff said. Christina Ricci also looks great and so does Claire Skinner in a small role. (4) ""Sleepy Hollow"" lacks the goofy vibe that some of Burton's films possess; the material is presented in a respectable, generally serious manner, albeit not as ultra-serious as, say, Hammer horror.

Speaking of which, ""Sleepy Hollow"" strikes me as a modern Hammer film more than anything else. Perhaps that's why Burton gave Christopher Lee a cameo. Needless to say, if you love Hammer (and who doesn't?) you'll appreciate ""Sleepy Hollow.""

The last half hour or so is packed with action so if your attention starts wandering, don't worry, it picks up big time. The plot's a whodunit and it gets kinda convoluted so you'll need to pay attention (or rewatch it). Not that you HAVE to because ""Sleepy Hollow"" is such a cinematic feast you can enjoy it even if the complications of the plot lose you.

There's nothing else to say except to re-emphasize that ""Sleepy Hollow"" is definitely the ideal spooky flick for the autumn, or any time really.

The film runs 105 minutes and was shot entirely in England with studio stuff done in Yonkers, New York.

These foretell of the mother of all storms sweeping all before it before something ever more ghastly occurs. As these dreams intensify, he begins to struggle determining what is real and what isn’t. Are these hallucinations or is he perhaps seeing an unwelcome future? Initially, both he and “Samantha” think this could be stress-related and so he seeks medical advice that merely results in him becoming medicated. When that doesn’t help and when he starts to take elaborate precautions to protect his family from this impending disaster, we too start to struggle to establish what is going on in his conflicted and frustrated mind. Shannon is on good form here offering an evocative portrayal of a man suffering from mental illness. His erratic behaviour stuns his family and his neighbours, and the reaction from their tightly-knit Christian community is one more of sympathetic self-preservation than anything more useful as the family begin to buckle. Chastain also delivers strongly here as her character has great difficulty is adapting to the irrationalities of her husband’s behaviour whilst dealing with the challenges brought by their equally bemused child. It’s quite a salutary lesson in the toxiticy of anxiety and it’s effects on not just the person who is sick, but on those intimates who must deal with the behavioural inconsistencies emanating from one they love who cannot control their actions. There is also a palpable sense of desperation on display here, and that’s at times really quite intense whilst all the time we are never quite sure just what might be happening with those storm clouds overhead. That ambiguity also works quite well presenting us with a thoughtful and provocative drama that’s a tough watch at times, but worth it.",2025-06-13T09:45:01.853Z,7.0,Take Shelter,2011

985,Sigeki Ogino,"We believe that films should ""make people happy"" (euphoria). No, we believe it should. Of course, there were thorny issues in getting there.
I used to say that ""movies are the art version of pornography"" if there was even a hint of sexuality, and in middle and high school I mainly watched ""erotic"" movies (""A Clockwork Orange"" being the first of these).
Looking back, I was a ""foolish spectator."" One day, however, a change came to me. I believe that an encounter with a movie can change your life, and the movie I encountered was ""Mulholland Drive,"" which turned my view of movies upside down, saying, ""I have never seen a movie like this.
Until then, to my surprise, I had never even heard of David Lynch (I'm embarrassed to say ‼︎).
From memory, between the ages of 12 and 13, I saw this surreal, showbiz-crazed entertainment at least a dozen times and was not only never bored, but drawn in. Isn't that amazing?
I mean, ""It was a 'monumental' movie in my life"" (my strongest experience in a movie theater was when I saw ""The Return of the King""). ......
So I had to see this film by a great filmmaker. In comparison, ""Lost Highway"" was an insignificant film.
Honestly, I don't know, but it seemed to be well received by the public. However, this is a common phenomenon.
A friend says, ""This movie is interesting,"" so I take his opinion and watch it, only to find that it is actually not that interesting.
Now it has become my ""rule"" and ""motto"" to ""choose my own movies.""
Even 'Blue Velvet,' which is considered Lynch's best film, was really bad."" What is so interesting about David Lynch?"" I am often asked. It is difficult to answer this question.
In fact, even if he had retired from the film industry after one film, ""Mulholland Drive,"" David Lynch would still be revered as the king of surrealist cinema, but my ""Lynch experience"" ends there. However, it was ""Eraserhead"" that started my ""Lynch experience"" back to the classics, and that is where it should have ended.
This creepy, nightmarish film, which even psychotic patients can't hold (and if Lynch portrays psychosis, he certainly sucks at it), was released in 1978 and although it didn't gain immediate popularity, it did gain a cult following by being shown in drive-in theaters and elsewhere.
""What is this creepy movie?""
I was astonished to learn that this movie was made in 1977. There were few ups and downs in the story and no visual beauty.
It was just a dusty, sandy factory area. An alien obsessed with the ""peculiar hairstyle"" of the main character, played by Jack Nance, gives birth to a deformed child and is sexually abused by his stepmother.
It is the story of Mary, the ""crazy fiancée"" who gave birth to the deformed baby and abandoned him, her sexual neighbors, and the puppies who suck chubby titties from the female dog. The chicken at the table runs like clockwork.
The ""deformed"" baby cries and we dissect it. The ""vomit"" comes down our throats, and it's painful to watch. Frankly, it made me sick. Was it my fault or the movie? Was it Jack Nance's fault?
By the way, please don't assume that ""Eraserhead"" is super difficult to understand. To me, Christopher Nolan's films are esoteric, but David Lynch's films are not so esoteric if you are in a position to ""watch"" them. The images may be boring because they embody a world that could happen to anyone (e.g., insanity or psychosis), but Lynch would not want to make it ""esoteric.""
Eraserhead is, in short, experimental science fiction (not breathtaking ""entertainment"") only in the guise of ""surrealism.""
It begins with two shots of ""Henry"" and a ""deformed child"" drifting through ""outer space,"" and eventually a creepy woman appears in ""high places"" and ""deep waters.""
The ""factory zone"" and ""outer space"" are connected until the creepy woman sings ""In Heaven."" The ""Alien Child"" is in ""intergalactic union"" with the man from ""The Distant Star"" and Henry Spencer.",2022-10-02T15:06:16.556Z,,Eraserhead,1977

11906,tmdb17996075,"There seems to be a never-ending feud between many horror fans regarding 'Suspiria', due to the fact that this film is considered Dario Argento's outstanding masterpiece. Personally, I'm completely against the idea of praising something that you don't actually like, so I respect anyone who thinks that this movie is overrated or even plain awful. My summary is only an opinion, but by no means I intend to make people change their mind or disapprove their concept of this film.

'Suspiria' is one of the many Italian horror films that came out during the late 70s and early 80s, that is extremely criticized for having a supposedly questionable plot and denouement. If we compare this movie to some of the other popular films directed by Dario Argento, we're probably going to think that 'Suspiria', is perhaps not as intriguing or well developed, when it comes to the story. To give a few examples of some of the Argento films that are widely considered the actual masterpieces because they offer an intriguing plot, good imagery and well done endings, I would probably name 'The Bird with the Crystal Plumage', 'Deep Red' and 'The Cat o' Nine Tails'. So what is it that we should believe? Nothing! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and even though I agree with those who claim that 'Suspiria' is Argento's real masterpiece, I would never waste my time trying to convince people that this is true. As a matter of fact, I'll be honest and say that I also believe that 'Suspiria' has a somehow underdeveloped story, but I still regard it as one of the best horror movies in history. The reason is simple: in my opinion, you can make something wonderful, without a wonderful plot. This is perhaps one of the most visually enchanting horror movies I have seen so far and I honestly doubt I will ever find another film that can enchant me as much as this one. Everything about 'Suspiria' is beautiful, even the violent deaths. I know this may sound sick and disgusting, but I believe Mr. Argento has the special gift to make beautiful images out of gruesome situations, like murder, for example. From the beginning until the end, this film takes us to a dark dreamland with beautiful contrasting colors, eerie locations and a recurrent unsettling music. The locations are perfect. The ballet school in which the story takes place, seems to be a nonexistent place taken from someone's dream. Indeed, it was revealed once that 'Suspiria' was partly inspired by a dream that Daria Nicolodi once had (Mrs. Nicolodi was the co-writer and Argento's girlfriend at the time). So if the idea was to create a dream-like movie, I would say they did a perfect job. Everything about 'Suspiria' looks surreal and charming. It's a dark fairy tale, in which the characters behave in a childish way, like playing along with the scenario. It is also said that the actresses were initially supposed to be little girls, but fearing that the film could be banned, Argento had to choose older actresses, but he didn't really change much of the dialogs, which I think is genius. Strangely, the characters don't come off as moronic or anything, they simply are strange and childish, but in a good way. The subject of sex, for example, is barely even mentioned, which is something that doesn't happen too often in horror movies with twenty-something year old characters. But regarding the actors who played these characters, I would mostly compliment the work of the late actresses Joan Bennett and Alida Valli. The young cast was simply fine, but no one did a remarkable job. Not even Jessica Harper, who was a bad choice for the lead character, in my opinion. This is probably the only little detail I would criticize about this film. Mrs. Harper pretty much has the same facial expression and tone of voice throughout the entire film, which is not good. On the other hand, like I said before, Mrs. Valli and Mrs. Bennett were flawless as the two bitter old women who run the school with their awful temper and their little psychological tortures against those who stand in their ways.

So concluding: 'Suspiria' is one of those films that you either love or hate. Both feelings are equally respectable and I can understand why some people don't really appreciate it. But if I have to recommend or 'sell' this movie to someone, I would definitely highlight the dream-like imagery and the creepy music composed by The Goblins, that go perfectly well with what is seen on the screen. Enjoy this dark fairy tale about witches and childish girls.",2017-02-14T00:31:24.154Z,10.0,Suspiria,1977

This is a masterpiece. Nothing will ever come close to this movie’s cinematography and soundtrack. Many people comment on the ‘style over substance’ aspect of Suspiria (and some of Argento’s other films), but I don’t see it as a flaw. It’s an experience. I don’t care if everything makes 100% perfect sense, when I put Suspiria on I feel transported to another world and that’s the best kind of movie. One that can just take you away from the real world. 

Suspiria is oddly comforting to me. I guess it’s that taking me away from the world feeling. It feels like a hug which I know isn’t what Argento was going for, but hey, apparently people ran out of theatres screaming in the 70s and I’m just a freak.

Would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I can’t imagine not liking it. I get that the dubbing and the cinematography or whatever may be a little jarring at first as beautiful it is, but go in with an open mind and let yourself get lost in the beautiful world of Suspiria and I can’t see anyone at least not somewhat liking it.

It’s end to end stuff this, marrying some quickly paced dialogue with some remarkably decent special effects creating quite a fun horror film that is fairly light on fear but full of loads of comedy antics before the military resort to their ultimate sanction, thanks to “Col.

446159,tmdb28039023,"With over 200 credits on his résumé — often as a vampire or vampire-adjacent —, revered German actor Udo Kier has appeared in some very good films as well as some very bad ones; Bacurau, a retarded A Sound of Thunder/The Most Dangerous Game hybrid ripoff, falls in the latter category.

The beginning is more or less promising. Tony Jr. (Thardelly Lima), mayor of the Sierra Verde municipality, to which Bacurau (which may or may not be the Portuguese word for 'bumf---') belongs, has blocked the dam and put it under the care of armed guards. 

His reason for doing this, though, is not very clear; Tony’s seeking re-election, but I don’t think hijacking the water supply is going to get him a lot of votes. To wit, when he visits Bacurau, the locals all lock themselves in their houses, from which they cover him in insults; their bravura, however, never reaches the sticks-and-stones phase. 

Oddly, the locals are so poor that their hatred of Tony does not preclude them from accepting the food he brings them, but not so poor that they don’t all have smartphones and/or tablets — and why wouldn’t they? Otherwise, the town’s Wi-Fi would go to waste.

So far good, I guess. Things only really go to hell when one of the residents sees a “drone” flying with all the grace of Gazoo’s spaceship (the drone is obviously computer generated until it “lands”; then it becomes a prop). The drone belongs to a group of foreigners led by Michael (Kier, sadly not playing a vampire).

Their plan is to lay waste to the place — never mind that it’s already pretty much a wasteland —, first slaughtering the population and then literally erasing the actual town from the map (or, at the very least, from Google Maps), leaving it as though nothing and nobody was ever even there at all — and that includes the villains themselves. To that purpose, “I have documents that prove we’re not here,” Michael says at one point. I’d really like to know what kind of documents those are and how exactly they work.

During that same conversation someone says that they never use modern firearms, only old ones. This is also never explained. My theory is that all the impossible technology they’ve used so far has eaten up the budget for fancy weapons.

One of the “hunters” complains that another killed a child; I guess their plan was to kill all the adults and leave the children to starve, or something. Needless to say, these aren’t the brightest bunch of killers. For example, they cut off the electricity in the town only to attack in broad daylight.

This ineptitude mirrors that of the filmmakers, who take a premise that could might conceivably weight as social commentary and turn it into a Brazilian version of Hard Target — or Perseguição Sem Tréguas, as they call it there.",2022-08-26T22:40:26.974Z,1.0,Bacurau,2019

""The Menu is one of the biggest personal disappointments of the year.

Mark Mylod's film boasts inspired performances by the entire cast - Ralph Fiennes and Nicholas Hoult stand out - and some clever satirical moments, but pretty much nothing else works. Humor falls completely flat - except for the sequences à la Masterchef Australia. Screenplay follows surprisingly generic paths, being a mystery without any minimally impactful shock. Characters lack depth, and the anti-elite message is too evident and insignificant.

It should still get an overall positive reception.""

593643,CinemaSerf,"Arch-foodie ""Tyler"" (Nicholas Hoult) and his girlfriend ""Margot"" (Anya Taylor-Joy) are off to dine in a restaurant without parallel. Based on an island of just twelve acres, they join a collection of wealthy and influential people for what has been defined as experience to die for! Upon arrival, we discover that ""Margot"" was not the originally intended guest of her companion - so first question... Who is she? Next question - why does it seem to matter so much to the fastidious and frankly rather menacing chef ""Slowik"" (Ralph Fiennes) and his assistant ""Elsa"" (Hong Chau) who looks like she used ""Rosa Klebb"" as a role model? As the dinner progresses it becomes quite clear that the menu is not just about the exquisitely prepared and presented food, but is also about an appraisal of the individually selected - and none too savoury - staff and clientele, none of who are quite what they seem! This has something of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"" to it, and it quite effectively pokes fun at the supercilious and frequently rather pompous attitude of both those cooking and those eating (or experiencing) fine foam dining. That humour is dark and potent, too. Fiennes is entirely convincing and Hoult, as well as Janet McTeer as the self-important food critic ""Lillian"" and Paul Adelstein as her suitably obsequious companion ""Ted"" contribute well as the sense of the ridiculous evolves into one considerably more perilous. It could have evolved just a bit more quickly for me - there are certainly enough ""get on with it"" moments and though ATJ's character is feisty, it doesn't quite work and ultimately served to illustrate the increasing implausibility of the story and unlikely servility of the diners as we head towards an almost Vernean denouement. It is quirkily entertaining this - a well presented, multi-layered, attack on our own senses that is better second time around.

The hype for The Menu intrigued me. The reviews celebrated its genius. So I had to see it. And when I sat in the theater and the credits began to roll, all o could say was, ""Huh?"" The Menu starts with Ready or Not vibes with a fish-out-of-water real-world character who ends up at a fancy dinner with a collection of high society foodies and critics. The trailer gave me expectations of cannibalism cult or Most Dangerous Game-type plots, but instead, nothing really happened. I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed. Anya Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast gave great performances, but there was little that really brought the movie together. Maybe the subversion of the cannibal or hunting expectation was the movie's brilliance? The Menu definitely tried to be clever, but whether it was or not might be open to interpretation.

The setup is fantastic, and the story gives you just enough information to intrigue even though the story path is somewhat generic. It is dark, honest, and quite hilarious.

The performances were great. Anya Taylor-Joy was brilliant and is cementing herself as one of the best actresses of the decade. Nicholas Hoult was hilarious in such a subtle way that never takes away from the tense scenes at play. Ralph Fiennes is haunting but also sympathetic, making him a very interesting and genuine antagonist.

593643,Nate Richardson,"> **Jim Jones; Executive Chef**

Going to a once-in-a-lifetime tasting at a restaurant headed by one of (if not _the_) most renowned chefs in the world sounds like a dream come true to any foodie. (Myself included, albeit vicariously via the Food Network) Two of these lucky guests are Tyler (played by **Nicholas Hoult**), and Margot (played by **Anya Taylor-Joy**).

The issue is, something is already not right.  No, it's not obvious; at least not to normal people like you and me. Elsa (played by **Hong Chau**) picked up on it, but she isn't like us.  As more and more guest arrive, someone isn't supposed to be there... Ah, don't worry, the feeling will pass.  After all, the tasting is just about to start...

This is when we meet the executive chef, Chef Slowik (brilliantly played by **Ralph Fiennes**).  At first he is charismatic and prepares his guest for each tasting with stories. But this little cult like bigrade eventually let on that they know more about their guests than anyone should... That is except for one. 

As someone who is enamored with the food world, seeing The Menu satire some of my favorite shows:

* Netflix's Chef's Table with the course spotlight cinematography and ingredients cards.
* Any Celebrity Chef (i.e. Chef Slowik calling someone a 'donkey', clearly a reference to Gordon Ramsey).  

...I was delighted that this film leaned into the dark end of how service work can feel sometimes.  This film feels cathartic having lived the life of a service worker, and I feel others who have had that experience should be able to connect to the darker parts of the film as well. 

The plot culminate in a theme that I think despite what mild morbidity was displayed, most watchers can relate; Be it society's expectations or our own, the more we push toward perceived greatness we run away from that childhood excitement that set up on the path to begin with. 

The Menu as a whole, is, well... Something you might hear at an actual tasting: A story of life, it's memories (good and bad) told in 5 courses.  If you're part of the menu, you deserve to stay until the end... That is, unless your not supposed to be here; perhaps life hasn't beaten you down enough yet...

593643,MovieGuys,"The Menu is a film defined by one key ingredient, the performance of Ralph Fiennes. His cold, biting acerbic chef, whose every word and nuance expresses a certain irony and a gradually building threat, is compelling. 

Frankly, it was Fiennes lynch pin performance that kept me watching The Menu. Had it been a less actor, I might well have walked away. Which brings me to the script. A predictable idea, with a certain promise that's far too loosely executed. The result is a plot that has more than a few dead ends and lacks a certain consistency and credulity. Its not awful, not at all. That said, with a more consideration and tightening of plot elements, it could have been so much more. 

In summary, if The Menu is remembered for anything, to my mind, it will be the remarkable performance handed in by Ralph Fiennes. The bulk of my 7/10 rating is based on his remarkable work.

593643,tensharpe,"“The Menu” takes anti capitalism and serves it up with a sprinkle or two of violence delivered on a plate by a perfectionist, cult leading chef. Mark Mylod produces a horror comedy that takes shots at culinary snobbery as well as performance art. 

Margot ( Anya Taylor-Joy ) and her supposed boyfriend Tyler (Nicholas Hoult ) take a boat, along with a number of other diners, to a remote Restaurant called Hawthorn situated on a private Island. The restaurant’s avant garde head chef ( Ralph Fines ) sells both art and home grown, self produced food to a select group of high earning customers with quality and presentation far above any other culinary experience. As the guests arrive they are first subjected to a tour of the Island to see the produce used in Hawthorn being grown and sea food being gathered. Once seated in the restaurant the food begins to be served along with a story from head chef outlining the dish and its significance to the overall experience.  Before the final course is served the stories become darker and more extreme culminating in the diners becoming fearful for their own lives.  

Before we reach the final course one sous chef announces that the menu requires “ an ending that ties everything together conceptually”. At this point in the proceedings it becomes clear that the restaurant staff are very much following the direction of their head chef without question, much in the way followers of any cult leader react.  “The Menu” is very unsettling and produces some uneasy, grimacing moments but balances them out well with enough humour and satire to make for a rather enjoyable experience.",2023-01-26T08:32:48.871Z,8.0,The Menu,2022

Then half way into the movie everything goes wild when the vampires enter the scene. I remember going “what the f…” when I first saw it since I wasn’t really expecting it to be a vampire movie at all.

It was probably the most fun I had at the cinema back in 1996. I absolutely love ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", very much one of those films that you either buy into or you don't. There's no surprise element with the film, you get everything that director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino said you would get - a hard buttocked road movie that turns into a raging ""B"" horror movie gore fest.

The plot, for what's it's worth, sees two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) & Richie Gecko (Tarantino) on the lam after Richie breaks Seth out of prison. They are heading for the haven of Mexico with wads of cash garnered from a robbery. After overcoming a couple of fatal (for others) hiccups, the brothers, in need of a vehicle, kidnap faithless minister Jacob (Harvey Keitel), his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu). From here they must make it to a rendezvous point in Mexico - a bar called ""The Titty Twister"", where they will exchange cash with a friend of Seth's and start their new lives as Mexican civilians. Trouble is, is that ""The Titty Twister"" isn't no ordinary bar, it's a vampire stronghold and the Geko's - and their newly acquired captives, are on the menu. Can they make it till dawn and let the daylight be their saviour?.

Swearing, blood, limbs severed, nudity, violence, sexual references, guns, more violence, more blood, other weapons, lots of teeth, bats, a snake, more violence. On it goes really, yet as Rodriguez and Tarantino start thrusting a blunt blade into your stomach, you really should be feeling them also caressing the funny bones in both your arms. For it's a key point that ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a damn funny film as well, something that bizarrely many critics have failed to understand. Honestly you can go to various sites and read people saying the characters are shallow, or the plot is preposterous!! Dear me, it staggers the mind. Hey don't like the film by all means, but failure to understand its genre leanings and homage persuasion is as funny as Cheech Marin is in the movie (one of many awesome ""B"" cult movie actors in the pic). It's bonkers and silly as hell, but once a fan of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", you are a fan for life. Well as long as you don't venture out to ""The Titty Twister"" yourself of course..

They escape into Mexico where they stop at a desert strip joint in order to rendezvous with their contact in the morning (Cheech Marin). Horror ensues. 

""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996) is a crime thriller/horror directed by Robert Rodriguez from Tarantino's script. Mixing ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) with the basic plot of ""Vamp"" (1986) and bits of ""The Lost Boys"" (1987) and ""The Evil Dead"" (1981), it pulsates with hip energy and flair. 

Clooney shines in his first feature film as the antagonist-turned-protagonist. Salma Hayek's dance routine is jaw-dropping and iconic. The movie blends weighty spirituality with extreme irreverence, violence, gore and comic booky evil for a entertaining flick, if you can stomach the nasty elements. It's not scary at all; but it's fun and thrilling in an increasingly farcical context, with thoughtful dialog and black humor.

The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in Barstow, Lancaster, Calico Dry Lake and Los Angeles, California; as well as Chihuahua, Mexico. The cast also includes: Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, Danny Trejo, Michael Parks, John Saxon and Kelly Preston.

1547,Wuchak,"**_Several lost boys but, unfortunately, only one lost girl_**

After a mother and two sons move from Phoenix to coastal town in Northern California, the older son (Jason Patric) gets involved with a gang led by a sinister guy (Kiefer Sutherland) while the younger son (Corey Haim) hangs out with two geeky vampire hunters (Corey Feldman & Jamison Newlander). Meanwhile the mother (Dianne Wiest) starts dating a shop owner (Edward Herrmann). Jami Gertz in on hand as the sole young female.

Released in 1987, ""The Lost Boys"" is a stylish and hip vampire flick that expertly meshes horror and humor. I usually don't like horror-comedies, but this one works well. The horror is pretty horrifying (in a fun way) while the comedy is consistently amusing. The coastal California locations are superb. However, the excellent train trestle sequence was shot in Alabama (see below).

I generally don't like 80's new wave pop rock, but the soundtrack is enjoyable, particularly the creative Lost Boys Theme, ""Cry Little Sister"" by Gerard Mcmann (with a catchy chorus sung by children). ""Lost in the Shadows"" by Lou Gramm is good as well. INXS, Roger Daltry and Echo and The Bunnymen also have songs on the soundtrack, the latter group doing a mid-80's version of The Doors' ""People Are Strange,"" which is very close to the original song and actually sounds like its Jim Morrison singing. The sax-playing beefcake sequence features one-hit wonder Tim Cappello playing ""I Still Believe.""

Speaking of beefcake, this zeroes in on my problem with this flick: There are multiple lost boys, but only one lost girl. Although Gertz is good-looking, she's always wearing a long skirt and so we never get a good look at her beyond her face (not talkin' 'bout nudity), with the exception of a campfire sex scene that doesn't work because it's premature and overall lame. Needless to say, a mid-80s horror flick without adequate females is scandalous. Director Joel Schumacher needed to take notes from the six Friday the 13th movies that had been released by the time ""The Lost Boys"" was shot. Oh, wait, Schumacher is, um, nevermind.

While the movie was largely shot in Santa Cruz, California, the vampire cave entrance was 350 miles south at Rancho Palos Verdes whereas the train trestle sequence was shot in Bayou Canot, Mobile, Alabama. The boys were able to jump into the underlying fog because the river was only 12-15 feet below, although the movie gives the impression that they were way higher up. Interior shooting was done in the studio at Burbank.

It's short 'n' sweet at 1 hour, 37 minutes.

As cinemas re-open with growing but limited capacity; the film is set for release and will be a great indicator as to if the public is ready to return to cinemas in significant numbers or will they sit it out and opt to see the film down the line on Paramount+.

The film opens with a look at the day things changed for the world as Lee (John Krasinski); does some shopping while news reports come in of an explosion in Shanghai. Enjoying the weather; he joins his family at a Little League game and talks with his friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy) when the game is interrupted by the appearance of a large fireball in the sky.

As they head home; the city falls under attack by deadly creatures and Lee and his family narrowly escape. The film then jumps forward immediately following the conclusion of the first film and Evelyn (Emily Blunt); attempts to lead her newborn son, daughter Regan ( Millicent Simmons), and son Marcus (Noah Jupe) to a safer locale.

When Marcus is injured along the way; Evelyn takes refuge with Emmett who is not happy to have to care for others after the loss of his wife and despite a secure locale in a foundry; demands the family leave the following day.

When an unexpected radio signal appears; Regan is determined to leave and find the source as she knows the frequency of her Cochlear Implant is a weapon against the creatures and she figures if that can be broadcasted and the information revealed; then humanity has a chance to fight back and win.

What follows is a very gripping and intense story as Regan and Emmett attempt to complete the mission while Evelyn and her family endure all manner of threats as they try to survive.

The film builds upon what made the first film so great in that there are strong and relatable characters and some very tense situations. The screening we attended was so quiet you could tell that audience members were so enthralled that they were afraid to make any noise.

The film ups the action and expands upon the universe without losing any of the strong character-driven elements or relying too much upon CGI to carry the film.

John Krasinski writes, directed, and produced the film, and while he has less screen time than he did in the original; the film is the rare sequel that holds its own and actually improves upon the original.

My only issue with the film was that the ending was rather abrupt and left me with several unanswered questions. While this would be more than fine if we were assured of a third film to resolve unanswered elements; word is that a spin-off is in development so hopefully this will resolve the issues I had or at the least co-exist with a third part of the series.

For now; “A Quiet Place Part II” drives home why we need the cinematic experience as from the large screen to the Dolby Atmos sound; the film is a sensory experience that needs to be enjoyed in a communal setting with maximum sensory input.

The film sets the tension meter to the max and never disappoints and I urge you to experience this film the way it was intended.

https://www.msbreviews.com

If you're reading this, then you probably visited my review of 2018's A Quiet Place. Hence, you know how much I absolutely love that movie. A low-budget, high-concept horror flick that surprised everyone, including myself, ultimately becoming one of the very best films of the respective year, as well as one of the best original horror stories in the last couple of decades. Now, I acknowledge that John Krasinski created something that could very well turn out to be the ""next big thing"" when it comes to horror franchises. However, that doesn't mean I support that endeavor. Artistically, I would much rather prefer for this to be a one-off, but I know better than anyone that if an original movie is tremendously successful at the box office - especially one that requires a short amount of money to make - sequel talks will obviously emerge.

My only major issue with the first film was, in fact, its ending. It's an admittedly badass conclusion, but it also felt like a cry to Hollywood in order to extend the story. I didn't expect this type of ending for such a character-driven personal project, but in all honesty, I rather have a sequel to A Quiet Place than the 10th SAW film or the continuation of the never-ending Fast & Furious saga. With that said, my expectations were still pretty high due to Krasinski's even more impactful involvement in the movie. With sole screenwriting credit and only possessing a few minutes of screentime this time around, Krasinski gets more time to focus on his primary technical role, delivering, once again, a masterfully directed film.

I find A Quiet Place Part II inferior to its predecessor in many ways, but the extreme levels of suspense generated by Krasinski's flawless direction are still the highlight of this saga. The beautifully shot opening sequence (cinematography by Polly Morgan) sets up the incredibly high level of tension for the subsequent monster scenes, all requiring the viewers to hold their breath for several minutes. These nerve-wracking moments are elevated by terrific acting performances across the board - I'll get there - but Krasinski demonstrates exquisite knowledge of the art of filmmaking, using his best attributes in favor of the movie. Boasting a nail-biting atmosphere and effective jumpscares, the characters find a few imaginative evasion maneuvers to avoid the monsters.

However, this leads me to one of my main issues with this sequel. The first film establishes the creatures in its ruthless, merciless first few minutes, where it becomes clear that if someone makes the tiniest noise and if a monster is nearby, they're dead. There's a minimal chance of survival, and the emotionally resonant ending also attests to this fundamental, lethal aspect of the whole ""sound-hunting beasts"" concept. Nevertheless, during the entire runtime of the sequel, including the phenomenal opening, it's like we're witnessing different monsters. If the first movie already had a couple of logic-related issues, this sequel increases the number of personal nitpicks.

People can run away quite a bit before the creatures get close - so much that I firmly believed the film would go back to the opening sequence to explain how the main characters managed to escape a specific attack. Protagonists survive absurdly improbable situations due to heavy plot armor. Even a couple of character/plot decisions are questionable, to say the least, particularly the trigger that sets up the third act. After the first movie, where everything feels surprisingly grounded and far from nonsensical, jumping to the continuation of the same story and having to disconnect our brain continuously is a bit disappointing, especially since the screenplay remains incredibly focused on the characters.

Almost every element in this film feels less emotionally impactful than the original, but it's far from being a massive letdown. In fact, having in mind the competition in the genre, A Quiet Place Part II might even be one of the best horror sequels ever for all I know. Firstly, the actors are absolutely magnificent. Emily Blunt (Evelyn) and Cillian Murphy - who I didn't expect to have that much importance and screentime as he has - bring their experience to a movie where the young actors are the ones who truly shine. Noah Jupe (Marcus) and Millicent Simmonds (Regan) steal the spotlight from the more renowned colleagues, delivering impressive performances that will surely guarantee them several award nominations by the end of the year.

The focus on deeply exploring the characters strengthens the emotional connection with the viewers, making every scene carry a certain gravitas. Ethical dilemmas are beautifully tackled through Murphy's character, Emmett, who creates an unexpected bond with Regan. The latter stands out as a brave, smart, altruist deaf girl who should inspire many people worldwide - it's worth remembering that Simmonds, a real-life deaf girl, brings outstanding authenticity to her role. Just like the original film, most dialogues contain sign language, so the narrative is also developed through visual storytelling. Once again, Krasinski knows perfectly when and how to tell the audience something exclusively through the camera, many times just pure silence, keeping the viewers' attention on the screen at all times.

Throughout the sequel, there are various visual nods and callbacks to the first flick that I also appreciated quite a lot, such as a certain object on a shelf or a repeated sentence. The ending carries less emotional weight than the original's brutal final minutes, but the entire last act will go down as one of the most impeccably edited conclusions of the year. Michael P. Shawver needs to cross-cut between excruciatingly tense sequences on completely different locations with important characters facing the same level of danger. The action is displayed seamlessly, letting the viewers genuinely enjoy the last moments of the movie without annoyingly choppy editing. Marco Beltrami's score is really gripping during the entirety of these last few scenes.

A Quiet Place Part II feels less than its predecessor in almost every element, but it's still one of the best sequels of the genre. From the riveting, frenetic opening sequence - much of it shot in long, uncut takes - to one of the most impressively edited endings I've seen in years, John Krasinski maintains an incredibly tense, suspenseful atmosphere throughout the entire runtime, something that's becoming a trademark of his directing career. Story-wise, the characters continue to be the main focus of the narrative. Boasting emotional dilemmas and bold character development, the kids have a surprising impact on the overall screenplay. Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt are remarkable, but Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds are astonishing, especially the latter. However, the monsters are depicted in a much less threatening, lethal manner, leading to many questionable plot decisions, as well as absurd survival situations. In addition to this, the world-building lacks significant revelations and creative ideas. Overall, it's a less emotionally resonant film than the original, which doesn't exactly let me down, but I did expect more from this sequel. Still, I highly recommend watching it at the theater. After all, both audience and critics are enjoying this movie tremendously...

Lee’s oldest kids become the key players here, with Emily Blunt’s Evelyn Abbott taking a backseat, while Murphy proves why he’s one of the most underrated actors working today.

Overall, A Quiet Place Part II is an exceptionally entertaining sequel with quality performances and a primary focus on monster mayhem which, as horror and suspense fans, we should all get behind.

It is nearly impossible to choose which is better: the original or the sequel. A Quiet Place: Part II expands the world of A Quiet Place outside of the Abbott farm adding new survivors and new locations. The characters become richer and more endearing as they develop throughout. There is even more to learn about the fearsome creatures as well. Part II boasts incredibly tense scenes that rival the first film that will have you on the edge of your seat and your heart pounding. There are some frustrating scenes where characters make idiotic decisions that build tension but also a slight annoyance, but alas, so are all horror films. This film is as good as the first and expands the franchise's universe with the hope of more epic, suspenseful-filled sequels.",2022-09-03T22:02:49.606Z,8.0,A Quiet Place Part II,2020

I may hold issues with the first film, though at least you can definitely class it as original given the use of sound. That 2018 film is very much enviroment-based, whereas this 2020 flick is far more human-based - and not in the best way. I still didn't dislike it, but I can't honestly say I found entertainment in it either - despite it having Emily Blunt and Cillian Murphy, two actors I tend to enjoy <em><b>a lot</b></em>. They are good here though, don't get me wrong.

I found this one to be more forgettable and ploddy, like does anything tangible actually happen? I'm struggling to remember anything, and I've only just finished watching. It's a pretty straightforward affair, this. I will note, however, that Millicent Simmonds does a neat job with her role throughout - an improvement from <em>'A Quiet Place'</em>, certainly (not that she is anything bad in that, mind).

Here's hoping Part III holds the first film's ilk. Admittedly, at least this one doesn't feature any moments as overtly stupid as its predecessor does (well, actually... OK, I'll let you off this time, Marcus).",2023-02-28T04:20:01.161Z,6.0,A Quiet Place Part II,2020
520763,tmdb51616167,"The ""A Quiet Place"" franchise has truly delivered a remarkable and unexpected story that has captured my attention in ways I never imagined. While I have previously reviewed the original movie, I am now diving into this extraordinary series.

The first film introduced a concept rarely seen in cinema, with its focus on minimal dialogue. Despite the absence of traditional conversations, the movie keeps viewers engaged and on the edge of their seats. The actors and actresses involved in the film are exceptionally well-suited to the unique demands of the story.

One aspect that stands out is the portrayal of the creatures without relying on overdone CGI effects. This choice creates a sense of suspense and keeps audiences guessing about the story's direction. The film's ability to sustain excitement is truly commendable.

In the sequel, the story delves deeper into the characters' journeys within this terrifying world. While there is slightly more dialogue, the film still maintains its gripping silence from the start and keeps viewers engrossed throughout. Even when encountering what appears to be alien characters, the film avoids excessive use of CGI, ensuring that the creatures are not portrayed in a ridiculous or unbelievable manner.

9392,CinemaSerf,"A group of six friends are heading off on one of those subterranean caving expeditions that just make me crave wide open spaces. The thing is, though, that one of their number takes them to somewhere hitherto unexplored - without telling them - and so once they start to squeeze their bodies and their kit into these unforgiving spaces, they have no idea where they are going nor what to expect. Not long into their expedition, they encounter some cave paintings and signs that perhaps someone had been there before after all, but instead of turning tail and getting back to the surface they press on to encounter something(s) altogether unexpected, gruesome and hungry. Now maybe one day, someone will make a group disaster thriller that presents us with characters about whom we might actually care, but this is certainly not one of them. The group have their standard mix of baggage, dysfunctional relationships, grudges and mistrust but given little effort is made to develop their characterisations we can just sit back and watch some eerily crafted photography, seriously effective acoustics and some inspired use of light and darkness that expose the vulnerabilities of human beings when not aground, up on two legs, with all five senses working in our favour rather than contributing to an increasing degree of panic amidst this more and more hysterical band of women. I wouldn’t say that any of the actors really stand out here, it could be anyone donning the high-vis jackets and carrying a rope. Indeed the personalities here are largely irrelevant to a truly claustrophobically effective story of what lurks beneath and how unwelcoming it can be to those who stray.

8337,tmdb87069603,"I have to admit up front to liking every single, John Carpenter movie. They are works of art in there unique style and quality.  This is actually my favorite of all of them.  There could be a criticism that this movie is didactic and sends some sort of clumsy  political or philosophical message but I'd have to reply that you simply don't get it. Unlike the modern propensity for movies to try to hammer home some political point or perspective, the message here is only window dressing.  The message may (or may not) be important but instead of getting caught up in some sort of self-important moralizing, let's remember this is a movie - and a SciFi action movie at that. (that is the approach in my opinion) If I would compare movies to literature or movie makers to authors I'd compare Carpenter to Hemingway - although Carpenter specializes in anti-heroes and sometimes over-the-top characters, while Hemingway is understated. They are analogous for their own medium.  This is action, sci-fi but like Hemingway's stories, this is a man's movie. Straight forward. Fun at times, brutal at times and even funny at times. Keep a watch out for one of the great one-liners in movie history when the star is in the bank - only peripherally related to ""bazooka.""  A+ to Roddy Piper as well. When I first saw this movie I had zero expectation from him.  Now I wish he'd have made a lot more movies...",2012-06-05T22:05:03.000Z,10.0,They Live,1988
8337,John Chard,"Life's a bitch and she's back on heat!

They Live is directed by John Carpenter who also adapts the screenplay form the short story Eight O'Clock in the Morning written by Ray Nelson. It stars Roddy Piper, Keith David and Meg Foster. Music is by Alan Howarth (and Carpenter) and cinematography by Gary B. Kibbe.

Unemployed drifter Nada (Piper) wanders into the city looking to find work, but upon finding a unique pair of sunglasses he sees a different world to everyone else. It's a world frequented by an alien race who are using the Earth for their own nefarious means.

See The Truth!

Carpenter does subversive sci-fi and it's a whole bunch of fun. Stripped back it's evident that They Live is Carpenter's wry observation on the politico posers who endorse the rich getting richer and everybody else sliding down the pole; to where they stop nobody knows! It's also a blatant paean to the glorious years of the 1950s when paranoia based sci-fi schlockers and creaky creature features ruled the air waves. It's also a wonderfully macho driven action movie, laced with comedy as well. You can rest assured there will be plenty of shooting, punching, dodging and spoken lines to make you smile.

Piper is no Kurt Russell, but we shouldn't hold that against him because he fills the role nicely. With muscular frame, 80s hair and a quip on the tongue, he is most assuredly a Carpenter leading man for the 80s. Alongside him is the reassuring presence of Keith David, himself a beefcake and also one of the coolest muthas on the planet. It's easy to believe that these two can save the planet, even after nearly beating each other to a pulp during a prolonged side-alley fight sequence, where Carpenter doesn't miss a chance to parody professional wrestling. While away from the beef, Meg Foster gets the lead lady role, with those amazing eyes nestling in perfectly with the world Carpenter has created.

Carpenter does political? Yes, but it's not the be all and end all of his intentions. He wanted to make an action sci-fi schlocker with sly politico undertones as motives. And that's exactly what he did. Joyously so. 8/10",2014-09-26T00:11:11.350Z,8.0,They Live,1988
8337,Nathan,"They Live is a great movie that delivers an exceptional story with a dystopian vibe that is both thrilling and terrifying.

John Carpenter's screenplay was ahead of its time in terms of its social commentary on American capitalism and the class divide. The film's story explores how a small group of people has taken control of the world by using subliminal messaging and manipulation, making it a unique sci-fi tale that is still relevant today. I particularly loved how the film built tension and hysteria in many scenes, such as the protagonist's discovery of the truth behind the hidden messages.

The performances in the film were okay, with some being better than others. Keith David and Meg Foster's performances stood out as impressive, bringing a sense of intensity and authenticity to their roles. On the other hand, Roddy Piper's performance was pretty corny, but it worked well for the film's B-movie style. Of course, nothing beats the iconic line ""I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubblegum.""

John Carpenter's direction was top-notch as always, with the ten-minute fight scene between John and Frank being a standout moment. The choreography was fantastic, and the lack of cuts made it a thrilling and believable engagement. The film's score was pretty basic, but it added a subtle tension to the entire movie and had a distinctly 80s feel to it. Carpenter's vision on analyzing American capitalism and the rich was very refreshing, and it's clear how he felt about the American way, which is still very relevant 35 years later.

In conclusion, They Live is a great movie that combines a unique sci-fi story, impressive direction, and memorable performances. Its themes and message remain just as important today as they were when the movie was first released.

6479,GenerationofSwine,"Oh this one just hurts. I mean, shout out to Will Smith. In 2022 he might be a beta fool, but he was still charming as all get out in this movie.

It just wasn't what it was supposed to be.

The source material was pretty amazing. Richard Matheson was on a pretty high horse when he wrote it and it came out as a pretty philosophical masterpiece in the way that only science fiction can.

It examined something and then it took that examination and turned it into a story... like science fiction should.

But ""I Am Legend"" just sort of examines Will Smith and the philosophical musings that made the source material great took a back seat to special effects and monsters and Smith.

I Am Legend follows the story of an isolated survivor still trying to find a cure to a pandemic that turned the world into crazed mutants. The movie's scale and cinematography are impressive, with large wide shots of nature slowly reclaiming the city of New York. Will Smith's performance carries the film (and kind of has to since he is alone for most of it). His emotion and conviction brilliantly convey the cost of his isolation and the toll years of suffering have taken on him. Long before John Wick had his dog, Robert Neville (Will Smith) had his dog in I Am Legend, and their relationship tugs on the heartstrings throughout the film. I Am Legend gives moments of suspense and horror, great action scenes, and psychological drama. I also enjoyed the religious references in the movie. There are really only two flaws I see in this film:

> 1. The CGI is dated and disappointing by today's standards, but it wasn't all that bad when the movie was first released.
> 2. The theatrical ending was decent, but if you can watch the alternate ending, do it! It is significantly better and helps fill some plot holes from earlier in the film (I believe the alternate ending was probably the original ending).

I Am Legend is an excellent story of survival and the breaking of a survivor's hope and mind. Will Smith's incredible performance makes this movie one of the better survival post-apocalyptic films.",2023-01-16T22:23:43.563Z,7.0,I Am Legend,2007

His acts largely solo and manages to make you feel the desperation.  There are some super sad moments in the movie, and it looks very bleak for the second half of the film.  

Then, the ending.  Nothing I say will be any different than any else.  Not sure why they got cute and changed it from the book.  That's what's holding it back from a higher score.",2025-04-26T00:31:24.869Z,7.0,I Am Legend,2007
333371,Reno,"> Adds a new perspective to the original film yet it retained the mystery.

Initially it was called 'The Cellar', but later it became spin-off to 'Cloverfield'. It was a regular type screen narration, unlike the first film as a found footage style. But if you the original film fan, especially monster film fan, you might end in a disappointment. Because it was a psychological-thriller-mystery than the sci-fi-action-adventure.

Only the final act determines where and how it actually connects to the Cloverfield universe, yet not very evident other than the clue the title had given and the filmmakers insisted that is indeed from the same franchise. Because I felt, it was very close to other alien invasion films like 'Skyline' and 'Battle LA' or even the latest 'The 5th Wave' than the 'Cloverfield'.

I surely enjoyed this film, like an another crazy bunker hideout theme and something which is quite similar to the recent 'Room'. Since they have revealed its association with the 'Cloverfield', I expected different kind which was actually insanely misled everybody. If there won't be a sequel, then the link between the two films are unnecessary, so I'm waiting for that. But still a very good film without those mix-ups. And I recommend you all to consider it as a one-off film in order to have a great watching experience.

Another limited cast film with barely a four characters in it and shot in a single location that cost just $15m, but earned in multiple folds. All the credit goes to the marketing tactics to tie it up with the 2008 blockbuster. It would have also done great independently, in the end everybody, including fans and filmmakers are happy for what it is now.

The suspense was so good, but it was carried out for too long. The third act picked up its pace like hell which was obviously anticipated since 'Cloverfield' hooked to it. When everybody was thinking of monsters, it is going to delivers differently and that's how the film fairs.

Michelle (Winstead) awakes from a car crash to find she is in a locked underground shelter...

From the off it has to be said that to know nothing about this film prior to viewing it will be an absolute bonus. For the rewards are plenty. Trachtenberg and his team have crafted a film that is tense from the get go, a piece that consistently has you wondering just what the hell is going on, not only are we puzzled by the three character dynamic in the shelter, particularly as regards Howard (Goodman), the proprietor of this particular shelter, but also just what has happened in the outside world? If anything? This only helps further the claustrophobic feel that's already brought about by the location setting of the tale.

A key strength of it, is that it, via Michelle's mindset, coerces us viewers into feeling her unease, and yet conversely we rejoice at her resourcefulness. On the same side of the coin comes her relationship with the third party in the shelter, Emmett (Gallagher Jr), it grows honestly and offers hope in what looks to be a bleak situation. But of course as tale unfolds, things start to come together, edgily so, with little spurts of action, shocks and genuine dread, all building up to the big finale, the reveals. Which will either have you spitting feathers or cursing the makers for the routes taken...

The movie's plot revolves around Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a young woman who wakes up in an underground bunker after being in a car accident. She soon learns that she is not alone, as the bunker's owner Howard (John Goodman) and another survivor, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), are also living there. Howard claims that the world above ground has been destroyed by a chemical attack, and that they are the only survivors. As the days go by, Michelle becomes increasingly suspicious of Howard's story and begins to investigate what is really happening outside of the bunker.

One of the strongest aspects of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is its cast. John Goodman delivers a stunning performance as Howard, a complex and fascinating character who oscillates between kind and sinister. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also delivers an outstanding performance as Michelle, who is smart, resourceful, and determined. John Gallagher Jr. is also very good as Emmett, providing comic relief and a counterpoint to Howard's eccentricities. The chemistry between the three leads is palpable, and their interactions are the driving force of the movie.

Another strength of the movie is its pacing. The movie is well-crafted, with a tightly plotted script that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The tension is expertly managed, with moments of respite used to build up suspense even further. The direction and cinematography are also top-notch, with the claustrophobic bunker scenes shot in a way that makes the audience feel as if they are trapped with the characters.

One minor flaw of the movie is its ending. Some viewers may find it unsatisfying, while others may find it to be the perfect conclusion to the story. However, it is consistent with the movie's themes and tone, and it ultimately comes down to personal preference.

In conclusion, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a remarkable movie that deserves to be seen by anyone who loves psychological thrillers. The strong performances from the cast, taut script, and excellent direction make it a must-watch movie. I would rate it 7 out of 10.

Dead Ringers is directed by David Cronenberg who also co-adapts the screenplay with Norman Snider from the book ""Twins"" written by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland. It stars Jeremy Irons and Genevieve Bujold. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Peter Suschitzky.

Identical twin gynaecologists Beverly and Elliott Mantle (Irons) run a high end fertility clinic in the city. Both in tune with each in spite of being different personalities, their world starts to fold inwards when Beverly falls in love with drug dependent actress Claire Niveau (Bujold).

Inspired by the real life story of gynaecologist twins Cyril and Steve Marcus (who were both found dead from suicide brought about by drug addiction), Dead Ringers is an amalgamation of unsettling horror and icy cold playfulness; in other words a perfect canvas for auteur Cronenberg to paint some of his peccadilloes.

Cronenberg doesn't need to be gory, gimmicky or schlocky, he instead utilises the characters on the page to spin a clinical character study. Themes pulsing throughout involve individuality, identity, misogyny, narcissism, eroticism and addiction, all played out in the mystical world of surgery and in-human metaphysics. The tempo never rises above a steady heart beat, rumbling along ominously, until we enter the home straight and the director delivers a devastating yet deeply moving conclusion.

Backed by a stunning dual performance from Irons, and a ballsy one from Bujold, Dead Ringers is a film of genuine greatness and a piece of work that's alive with smart ideas. 8.5/10",2014-09-26T00:08:47.077Z,8.5,Dead Ringers,1988

As the search becomes more intricate, ""Angel"" finds himself having doors slammed in his face, or even worse before he is immersed in a world of voodoo in a distinctly unwelcoming New Orleans.

Can he also discover quite why the enigmatic ""Cyphre"" wanted him on the case in the first place? This is one of those whodunit's where the quest itself is not one of the more riveting parts of the plot. ""Angel"" has an ability to turn almost everyone he sees into metaphorical stone - including Charlotte Rampling's rather mysterious ""Margaret"" - what's going on? Alan Parker keeps the Hjortsberg story moving along quite faithfully to the book, allowing us to gradually get a sense that all is not as it seems, that poor old ""Angel"" is being manipulated and that things are probably not going to end well for him! O'Rourke carries that off really well - he injects a swarthiness and grit to his character who clearly isn't quite as hard as he would like people to think, and De Niro - though infrequently on screen - also manages to create that slight sense of malevolence as the penny begins to drop for all watching.

837,CinemaSerf,"""Max"" (James Woods) runs a television channel that specialises in adult content. Always on the look out for new and more innovative and shocking content, he stumbles upon a brief series of satellite images that tantalise him. It's on a television talk show that he meets ""Nicki"" (Debbie Harry) who has a penchant for sex with a twist - and that not only turns them both on, but furthers his desire to obtain his newly found (and pretty violent) content for his Channel 83 output. The other guest on that show is the renowned ""Prof. Oblivion"" (Jack Creley) who prognosticates that one day the reality of television and video will replace the ""real"" reality. These threads slowly all tie together when ""Nicki"" decides that she is going to star in this new ""Videodrome"" enterprise and ""Renn"" must now reconcile his concern for her safety with his mounting need to acquire the show. This film is surreal and bizarre and yet it's still quite effective at illustrating the most visceral aspects of human nature - sex, venality, lust - even pain; and the visual effects (particularly towards the last fifteen minutes) must have been particularly effective. It's a bit on the sordid side - not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but at times the seaminess of it all is distracting from the more interesting and provocative aspects of the narrative. Time hasn't been very kind to it either, the effects have lost much of their potency now and the acting is mediocre at best.

The Changeling is directed by Peter Medak and co-written by Russell Hunter, William Gray and Diana Maddox. It stars George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Melvyn Douglas, John Colicos and Jean Marsh. Plot finds Scott as John Russell, a music composer whose life is shattered when an accident kills both his wife and young daughter. Relocating to Seattle, Russell rents a large Gothic style mansion from which to bury himself in his work. But he soon discovers he is not alone in the house, there is a ghost here and it desperately wants his help with something...

Not a teenager or a scantily clad bad actress in sight here, for this is a traditional haunted house spooker for the adults, one that has a distressing mystery at its core that's just aching to be solved. Chief writer Russell Hunter has based much of the film on an incidents that happened to him in real life when he moved into a house in Denver. If you believe him or not is not really the point, because it does not take away from just how well executed The Changeling is, both as a scary movie and a well thought out drama. There's limited characters in the narrative, thus keeping the film free from filler and the clumsy character set-ups that mar so many horror films these days. It's also worth noting that it doesn't suffer from dating either, as Nicole Kidman starrer The Others proved 21 years later, a haunted house tale can be effective in any decade if the writing and direction is spot on. The Changeling has both, plus a towering and believable performance from Scott leading the way.

Medak clearly knows that an imposing house is a key element. Utilising the big spaces to emphasise Russell's loneliness, he sweeps his camera around the sets (this is not a real house, it's a brilliant mock-up creation by the designers) to give the feeling of a spirit observing proceedings. The house is always a main character and acts as the perfect backdrop to some ghostly goings on (excellent work from the sound department too). The chills are genuine, the attic room is creepy personified, a rubber ball, a wheelchair, a bath sequence, an old water well and even the gentle tinkling from a music box, all induce the hairs on the back of the neck to stand to attention. And there's a séance! Oh yes indeed, a séance that's tape recorded, more chills down the spine on the way there as well. All played out to some lush unholy musical arrangements from Ken Wannberg (the music box theme composed by Howard Blake).

Setting it apart from conventional haunted house movies is that it has a most intriguing story to tell. One of murder, greed, deception and grief. The latter part is often forgotten when talk of The Changeling arises. John Russell is absolutely stricken with grief, this stops him from being one of those characters who you shake your head at because they refuse to leave a clearly troubled house. His grief process, which makes him the ideal host for what this spirit wants, means he has no fear, some unhappy ghost can't hurt him anymore than he is hurting anyway. It's a neat and seamless meditation on grief that's threaded into the story. The last quarter of the film slips into action territory, which is a little jarring given the smooth pacing Medak has favoured up to that point. But although the scares have gone, the intelligent story has come full circle and the film closes down triumphantly without copping out or having resorted to unimaginative formula.

An essential viewing for those who like haunted house movies; especially if you like slow build and genuine mystery as well. 9/10",2019-06-25T18:52:27.987Z,9.0,The Changeling,1980
13550,Wuchak,"_**George C. Scott grapples with a haunted house**_

A grieving composer (Scott) rents a mansion in Seattle that’s been unoccupied for a dozen years and starts a relationship with the Historical Society agent who offered it to him (Trish Van Devere). Unfortunately, the manor has a shameful history and weird things start happening.

""The Changeling"" (1980) is haunted house horror in the tradition of ""The Legend of Hell House"" (1973), ""The Evil"" (1978) and ""The Amityville Horror"" (1979). While it's not as good as ""Amityville Horror,"" it's pretty much on par with ""Legend of Hell House"" and “The Evil” and would influence future ghostly flicks, like ""The Ring"" (2002). 

The writer of the book and co-scripter, Russell Hunter, claimed the story is based on his experiences while living in the Henry Treat Rogers mansion in the Cheesman Park neighborhood of Denver in the late ’60s.

For me, the apparition is accorded too much power by the scriptwriters in the second half and this provokes a “Yeah, right” response rather than scares or awes. A good example is setting a house on fire at will. Why Sure!

Trish, by the way, was Scott’s wife from 1972 until his passing in 1999.

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and was shot in the Vancouver area, Seattle, and New York City (Lincoln Center), with one scene done in Toronto.

To think that Bill Murray was thought by Stephen King to be a better option is crazy.  Walken's performance brings out the best in the rest of the ensemble as the movie goes through 3 acts, with several stories intermingled quite nicely with each other. While it is not a true horror movie, in my opinion, the work of David Cronenberg comes out nicely in some scene's that remind you he is in charge of our minds during the 100 minute or so feature.

11868,John Chard,"Sleep well, Mr. Harker.

The Curse of Frankenstein was coining it in at the box office, so Hammer Films were quick to negotiate a deal to reinvent Dracula on the big screen. Certain agreements were made as per distribution rights for Universal, who owned the rights via a deal that was struck decades earlier with the Bram Stoker estate. Once all the dots were dotted and the t's were crossed, Dracula hit the screens in a whirl of sensual Technicolor bliss, where the trajectory of horror film history was shunted upwards to the point that the legacy still lives on today.

Directed by Terence Fisher and adapted to screenplay by Jimmy Sangster, Dracula (AKA: Horror of Dracula) is a compact piece of horror. The Hammer team condense Stoker's novel down to an 80 minute film, quickly placing Jonathan Harker (John Van Eyssen) at Castle Dracula and establishing the vampire legend courtesy of the slick and sexy Count Dracula himself (Christopher Lee). There's no changing into bats or scaling of walls here, in fact Dracula's dialogue is very minimalist, instead he permeates the film with sexual menace, horrific suggestion and an obvious disregard for humanity, with Lee in the role simply terrific.

Then it's time for Doctor Van Helsing to bring his cunning whiles to the party, which is the signal for Peter Cushing to enter the fray, who adds class and elegance to a classic role. James Bernard provides a dual score of erotic swirls and thunderous scares, while the cast play out the story in front of some impressively constructed Gothic sets, courtesy of Bernard Robinson, who like the rest of the team were working with a budget under six figures! Some nifty effects work cement the pic's status, other little touches - such as Dracula having no audible footsteps - also ensure that Hammer's Dracula remains a key vampire movie of note.

A number of interesting tid-bids sit in the film's back history. How it fell into the public domain, complaints about blood transfusion advertisements in theatre foyers during its first run! Censorship and the ""X"" Certification afforded it in the UK, and that some of the first wave of critic reviews were positively barbed and indignant. In truth Hammer would produce far better horror films post Dracula's release, in fact this is not even the best of the Hammer Dracula movies. Yet in the pantheon of Hammer film, and horror film in general, it's a 10/10 movie. Terence Fisher deserves the final word, he would say that the shoot and production for Dracula just clicked, it all worked and everyone was in sync. 8/10",2015-05-23T14:30:21.845Z,8.0,Horror of Dracula,1958
11868,Wuchak,"Hammer’s first vampire flick with Christopher Lee as the Count.

RELEASED IN 1958 and directed by Terence Fisher, ""Horror of Dracula"" chronicles events when Jonathan Harker (John Van Eyssen) goes to Dracula’s castle under the pretense of a librarian. Later, the Prince of Darkness travels to Karlstadt, Germany, to prey on Harker's fiancée, Lucy (Carol Marsh), and her relatives, Arthur & Mina (Michael Gough & Melissa Stribling). Dr. Van Helsing (Peter Cushing), a student of vampirism and a friend of Harker’s, shows up to try to put an end to the Count’s reign of terror.  

Hammer Studios did nine Dracula films from 1958 to 1974: Horror of Dracula (1958); The Brides of Dracula (1960); Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966); Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968); Taste the Blood of Dracula (1969); Scars of Dracula (1970); Dracula AD 1972 (1972); The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973); and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974. Christopher played the Count in every one of these except ""The Brides of Dracula"" and ""The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires."" 

Hammer fans typically praise this first film in the series, Lee's first gig as Dracula, and it is a solid entry with the typical Hammer highlights: Lush Gothic ambiance, bright colors, Lee & Cushing and bodacious women. Lee's diabolical interpretation of the Count is another highpoint, not to mention one of the most stunning horror scores by James Bernard. Unfortunately, the abridged story loosely based on Stoker’s novel is somehow unsatisfactory and there are too many 50's limitations IMHO.

Here’s one curious abbreviation: In the book the story starts in Transylvania, switches to England with Dracula voyaging to London, but ends up back in Transylvania for the climax. Coppola’s 1992 film adhered to this European globetrotting, but Hammer decided to simplify the geography where travel time is condensed to something akin to a European theme park rather than reality. The tale starts outside of Klausenburg, the capital of Transylvania in Central Romania at the time, with Drac’s castle nearby, then switches to Karlstadt, in South-Central Germany, which is roughly 750 miles from Klausenburg in reality, yet a mere carriage drive away in this film, perhaps 20 miles.

Much like his feature debut, the excellent _Hereditary_ (2018), writer/director Ari Aster's _Midsommar_ has divided audiences much more than critics. Whereas _Hereditary_ had an 89% critical approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 8.26/10, it managed only a 65% audience approval rating, with an average score of 3.43/5, whilst also famously garnering a pitiful D+ CinemaScore. _Midsommar_ currently has an 82% critical approval with a 7.51/10 average, against a 61% audience approval, with a 3.36/5 average and a C+ CinemaScore. This recalls recent films such as Robert Eggers's _The VVitch: A New England Folktale_ (90% with a 7.77/10 average vs 58% with a 3.22/5 average and a C- CinemaScore) and Trey Edward Shults's superb _It Comes At Night_ (87% with a 7.36/10 average vs 44% with a 2.75/5 average and a D CinemaScore). The reason for the discrepancies? In large part it's because all four films were promoted as something they weren't, drawing in audiences who were disappointed that they didn't get what they were expecting; all four were heavily promoted as horrors, when none in fact are (and in the case of _It Comes At Night_, not even remotely close). As for _Midsommar_, it is, at best, a thriller, and I would argue that even that's pushing it. Whereas _Hereditary_ was a study of grief and familial breakdown, it undeniably had horror elements (the floating self-decapitation scene is one of the most haunting images put on screen in decades). In the case of _Midsommar_, however, apart from one very brief moment involving somebody wearing somebody else's skin (don't ask), there's nothing remotely resembling a horror trope, and very little that's thrilling. Which is not necessarily a criticism; I enjoyed the film very much, I simply think the marketing people have once again set the movie up to fail with a lot of the people who will see it.

What _Midsommar_ does have in abundance, however, is dread, which is, of course, very different to horror. More unsettling than frightening, as with _Hereditary_, _Midsommar_ is primarily an allegory built on a foundation of generic tropes – both films begin with paralysing tragedies that almost cripple the protagonist, with the subsequent narrative analysing the psychological reaction to such tragedies by way of various spooky goings-on. And whereas _Hereditary_ dealt with the lengths one may go to shut off deep emotional pain, _Midsommar_ is more interested in what happens when the initial pain of bereavement starts to wear off, especially when the only person one feels one can turn to isn't exactly sympathetic to one's situation. Aster himself has called it a ""_breakup movie_"", and it's hard to argue against this categorisation, as the story begins and ends with very specific relationship drama. And whilst the characters are grossly underwritten, and the film is painfully predictable (if you're familiar with Robin Hardy's _The Wicker Man_ (1973), chances are that everything you think is going to happen in _Midsommar_ does happen), it's beautifully crafted, brilliantly shot almost entirely in glaring sunlight, and vastly ambitious in scope (it runs 147 minutes). Indeed, it's the type of film where you can tell the director was given an unusual amount of freedom to fulfil their vision. And whilst that can often result in unmitigated disaster (think filmmakers such as Michael Cimino, Richard Kelly, and David Robert Mitchell), much like Jordan Peele's _Us_ (2019), _Midsommar_ avoids the dreaded sophomore slump without necessarily knocking it out of the park.

The film begins as Dani Ardor (a superb Florence Pugh) is hit with the kind of tragedy from which many would find it impossible to recover - her bipolar sister has killed their parents and subsequently committed suicide. Already emotionally fragile and prone to anxiety attacks even before their deaths, the incident sends Dani spiralling into despair, turning for support to her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor), an anthropology student struggling to find a topic for his PhD thesis. Unfortunately, for some time, Christian has wanted to break things off with Dani, as he finds her overly needy, and he had been trying to work up to ending the relationship when her family died. The following summer, Dani learns that Christian and fellow students Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter) have been invited by Swedish student Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) to his ancestral pagan commune in Hårga, where a midsummer celebration that only occurs once every ninety years will be taking place, with Josh planning to write his PhD thesis on the festival, and Mark planning to have sex with as many Swedish girls as he can. Dani is upset that Christian didn't tell her about the trip, and to placate her, he invites her to come, never imagining she will say yes. But she does, much to Mark's disgust, and so the foursome accompany Pelle to Sweden, meeting the disturbingly polite and welcoming members of the commune, as well as English students Connie (Ellora Torchia) and Simon (Archie Madekwe), who were invited by Pelle's brother Ingemar (Hampus Hallberg). It doesn't take long, however, for the visitors to learn that things aren't exactly kosher in the commune - whether it's the elderly couple who fling themselves from the top of a cliff, the pies with pubic hair in them, the ""oracle"" child specifically bred through incest, the caged bear who seems to have no function in the festival, the strange yellow pyramid building which they are forbidden from entering, the elaborate murals depicting violence and torture, or the communal wailing.

_Midsommar_ originally began life as a slasher movie set in a Swedish commune, until Aster revised the script to focus on a toxic relationship after going through a particularly bad breakup himself. Christian is your garden variety manipulator, who uses Dani's emotional vulnerability against her. For example, in a brilliantly written early scene, after she has learned about the trip, she's understandably upset that he didn't tell her about it, but in the space of just a couple of minutes he manipulates her into apologising to _him_. The core of the story is Dani slowly coming to realise that Christian isn't the man she thought he was, and in a weird way, it's a variation on the female revenge genre. However, whereas usually it's revenge for rape or assault, here it's revenge for being a complete and utter dick. In this sense, the film is primarily an allegory for the process of a young woman's emotional/spiritual awakening independent of the man on whom she thought she had to rely. Indeed, one could take this even further if one reads the character names as symbolic; Dani's surname is Ardor, but she is denied love and passion, and in the paganism of the commune, she's offered something she can't get from a self-serving Christian(ity). Whether _Midsommar_ works for you or not will depend largely on how you respond to this element of the story - if you buy into the notion that Christian is the _de facto_ villain, and that Dani is an emotionally scarred young woman looking for support, you'll get a lot more out of it than if you think Dani is a needy whinger and Christian would do well to be rid of her.

Aesthetically, the film looks terrific, with Henrik Svensson's production designer, Andrea Flesch's costume designer, and Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography especially praiseworthy. Whereas the US scenes are dark and confined, taking place in small poorly lit rooms with the characters wearing drab costumes, once the film shifts to Sweden, the visual design changes completely. The production design emphasises an open-plan vastness with unlimited space to move, but few places to hide; the cinematography drenches everything in glaring sunlight, which, again, makes it hard to hide; and the costume design focuses on brilliant white, with a smattering of colour. Unlike the vast majority of horror movies, there are few shadows or dark corners, but the film is shot in such a way that the very lack of such is itself disconcerting. The same is true for the always pristine costumes, which suggest that something is just not quite right underneath the veneer of cleanliness and insincere sense of perfection. Indeed, the attention to detail in the presentation of the commune is immensely impressive; the long middle act doesn't really feature much in the way of narrative incident, but it sure does a fine job of creating a _milieu_ that feels completely authentic and lived-in.

There are also some nice individual moments. For example, the choral singing with which the film begins is harshly interrupted by a telephone ringing, suggesting the clash between tradition and modernity that will play out throughout; Dani's hysterical crying upon learning of her family's deaths blends seamlessly with Bobby Krlic's wonderfully discordant music; a superb single-take shot takes Dani from heading to her apartment bathroom to entering the bathroom of an airplane; a high altitude shot showing a car travelling along a country road is imbued with malevolent undercurrent as the car passes under the camera, but rather than turning around to pick the vehicle up on the reverse angle, the camera follows the car by turning downwards, ending up upside-down, signalling to the viewer that things have changed irrevocably for the characters, as if they have crossed a barrier of some kind.

In terms of the narrative design, somewhat unusually, the film wears its predictability on its sleeve, with many of the major narrative beats not only foreshadowed but literally shown to the audience prior to occurring in the story, whether it be the mural that opens the film or the illustrations seen on the walls all over the commune – the _dénouement_ isn't simply hinted at, it's all-but presented to us from the outset. With that in mind, anyone who has seen any folk horror will be able to predict much of what happens. Even if you're only familiar with _The Wicker Man_, you'll still be able to take a decent stab at how things are going to turn out. Of course, this allows the audience to roundly mock the characters' utter obliviousness to what's coming, which is presumably the point. You know that scene in most horror films where you think to yourself ""how can they not realise something nasty is going to happen""? _Midsommar_ is like a 147-minute version of that one scene.

As for the acting, much as _Hereditary_ was Toni Collette's, _Midsommar_ belongs entirely to Florence Pugh, who's going from strength-to-strength at the moment. For most of the film, she's on the precipice of a nervous breakdown, with her performance redolent of Shelley Duval in Stanley Kubrick's _The Shining_ (1980). Pugh has already impressed in films as varied as Carol Morley's _The Falling_ (2014), William Oldroyd's _Lady Macbeth_ (2016), Richard Eyre's _King Lear_ (2018) and Stephen Merchant's _Fighting With My Family_ (2019), but _Midsommar_ is easily her best and most layered performance thus far, especially the gamut of contradictory emotions she runs in the batshit insane last 20 minutes. Elsewhere, the performances are all fine, but the actors aren't helped by the script. As Christian, Jack Reynor plays, well, Jack Reynor. There's nothing really wrong with the performance (although he is the least convincing academic ever put on screen), and he does do a decent job of getting the audience to loathe his passive-aggressive persona, but there isn't a huge amount of depth. The same is true of Will Poulter, who plays Mark as the kind of ignorant sex-crazed loudmouth that seems to only exist in the movies and who is never characterised beyond this caricature. As Josh, William Jackson Harper, although a far more believable academic than Reynor, barely registers, whilst Vilhelm Blomgren's Pelle is so one-note and obviously untrustworthy that it pushes suspension of disbelief to breaking point.

As this might suggest, one of the biggest problems with the film is the underwritten characters. This is especially true of Christian, a boyfriend so selfish and uncaring, one wonders how he ever wooed Dani in the first place. Additionally, their relationship is demarcated along painfully stereotypical lines – the emotional female whose need for support becomes overwhelming and the thoughtless bro who is more interested in hanging out with the boys than comforting his girlfriend. Another issue is that even aside from the character of Pelle, the film pushes the suspension of disbelief too far. There are multiple moments when the goings-on in the commune should prompt the visitors to leave immediately, but apart from a few weak attempts by Dani to persuade the others to go, they repeatedly accept the most ridiculous of situations based upon the most tenuous of explanations. Indeed, in a lot of ways, they're no different from the horny idiots who get picked off one by one in so many cheap slasher films. Furthermore, it doesn't help that initially Josh is depicted as an expert on paganism, and is familiar with many aspects of the festival, but later on, the script conveniently forgets about this when necessary.

Thematically, things are also quite jumbled. Whilst the core theme of a toxic relationship is present to one degree or another throughout, and Aster actually has some interesting things to say about complicity in such relationships, a lot of other ideas are thrown into the mix without really going anywhere – death, renewal, paganism itself, the nature of grief (and given the strong opening, that Aster allows this theme to drop off is especially disappointing). Additionally, as already mentioned, there are few surprises here. Aster is obviously a big fan of the subgenre of folk horror, but he allows reverence to the tropes supersede any kind of narrative inventiveness, leading to predictability, and as insane as the last 20 minutes are, nothing really happens that surprised me. Also, as in _Hereditary_, the explanation for what's going on isn't anywhere near as interesting as the ambiguity preceding it, making explicit something which was so deeply unsettling when implicit.

That all said, however, I did enjoy _Midsommar_. Not as disturbing as _Herditary_, it finds Aster again working with dread rather than quintessential horror tropes. Aesthetically impressive, and built on a terrific central performance, it could be accused of style over substance or cited as an example of a filmmaker whose ambitions outweigh his abilities, but ultimately, Aster's mastery of tone sees him through. The script could use some work, no doubt, but the ominous sense of dread is palpable throughout and is brilliantly handled, with the most mundane of objects imbued with haunting portentousness. The _dénouement_ is more rote than I expected, and although Aster tries to tackle too many issues, his depiction of the death throes of a toxic relationship is as penetrating and emotionally honest as any ostensible relationship drama. Unnerving and audacious, _Midsommar_ is, ultimately, an exceptionally confident piece of filmmaking, if not necessarily an exceptional piece of filmmaking.",2019-09-23T23:03:26.080Z,7.0,Midsommar,2019
530385,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

This was easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Hereditary was my favorite film of 2018, so obviously, Ari Aster's second feature grabbed my full attention from the very first announcement. Fortunately, even though Midsommar is only being released now in my country, I was able to stay away from spoilers, as well as from any sort of images or clips. As you might expect, this is not a typical horror movie, even though it's being marketed as belonging to the genre. Sure, it has some horror stuff that indisputably connects it to the genre, but it definitely doesn't play out to scare audiences or make you have nightmares at night.

Hereditary was quite divisive among audiences due to the lack of traditional jump scares and generic entertainment, besides it being too excessive regarding spiritualism for the general public. Midsommar is undoubtedly going to be even more divisive. First of all, it drags. There's no denying it. The first weird cult scene only occurs about one hour in, which in a 140-minute runtime is a bit too far ahead. Granted, it's one of the most shocking and horrific sequences in the daylight I've ever seen, but its build-up (extremely well-done) takes a big part of the second act, slowing down the pacing too much.

Additionally, it's a film that entirely relies its entertainment value on the feeling of shock instead of fear. If you didn't enjoy Aster's first feature because it didn't have enough scary sequences, Midsommar isn't going to convert you to being a fan of his work. Similarly to Ad Astra (just released last week), it's a story that requires the audience to care about more than only superficial aspects. If you go in expecting to leave your brain outside just so you can be uncloudedly entertained, then you might want to think again. I can't stress this enough: you need to pay attention to what you're watching!

Hints to what the story holds for us are everywhere, especially in the walls. Through paintings, runes, and hand-drawings, Ari Aster spreads basically all the information you need to better understand where the movie is going. It's a film about two key themes: how to deal with grief, and how to handle a complicated relationship. These are the issues that people should be able to acknowledge and understand how they're being developed. I love how Aster addresses the latter topic (he wrote this screenplay after he ended a relationship of his own), but I'm disappointed by the way he put the former into the ""background"".

The first 15-20 minutes deal with what happens to Dani's life, and it's never approached again, even though there's a vague idea of what could have actually happened, by the end of the movie. Regarding the other point, it isn't exactly a ""toxic"" relationship that we've seen in previous films, but one where each person is waiting for an excuse to leave the other. Hence, some actions feel forced in the hope that they can trigger something. It's a strangely realistic yet uncomfortable take on something a lot of people go through. Technically, this is one of 2019's most fascinating productions.

From the colorful cinematography to the impeccable editing, from the stunningly impressive production design (again, the WALLS!) to the immersive score … Ari Aster is no joke. The way he handles dialogues is a treat to someone like me, who cares so much about engagement through characters speaking. There are so many long takes with Florence Pugh giving her all, just raw and powerful emotions. It's her career-best performance, no doubt about it. Her character's storyline is partially what brings the ""horror"" to the narrative. Just like Toni Colette on Hereditary, Pugh is probably going to be ignored during the awards season, as well as the movie's technical achievements since the horror genre still didn't convince enough people to give a shot.

Regarding the other characters, they're my main issue. They simply felt like plot devices. Will Poulter (Mark) is funny as the comic-relief guy, but his character, like every other one besides Dani, doesn't do much to make me care about or feel invested in their own subplots (if there are any). They barely have any backstory, and their purpose is basically to help move the plot forward by giving Aster opportunities to show some pagan rituals of some kind. There are incredibly shocking, bloody, and jaw-dropping scenes, some might make you feel uncomfortable, others might make you laugh. But they're all meant to shock you in some shape or form.

Whether you love it or hate it, Midsommar is memorable. If you didn't enjoy Hereditary due to the lack of jump scares, the former isn't for you then. Midsommar requires full attention, patience, and an open-minded mentality. It's not a generic horror flick, so don't go in expecting to be constantly entertained by silly scares. Expectations are everything, so moderate them in the best way possible. It has one of the most abstract ways of addressing a difficult relationship and how to deal with grief, but if you LOOK AT THE WALLS, you'll be able to (maybe) follow the story a bit better.

Technically, Ari Aster delivers a masterful work, with exceptional production design and gorgeous cinematography, plus seamless editing. Florence Pugh carries the story on her shoulders with an astonishingly compelling performance, but her supporting cast didn't do much with their under-developed characters. The film drags a lot, and it can become tedious at some point, but in the end, it's one of those movies that sticks with you. A second viewing may be necessary, and it will probably be a better experience. Can't wait to find out. Go see it!

530385,Gimly,"_Midsommar_ might genuinely be my big disappointment for 2019. I'm not saying it's bad. But coming into this on the back of not only the crazy good _Hereditary_ from last year, but also the **gushing** praise from the online horror community, I guess my expectations were a little high. It doesn't make me feel good to say it, but honestly I'm glad I didn't see this in the cinema. Firstly because I think I might've been a little mad if I had forked out $25 to see this, based on the experience I ended up happening, but also secondly, because I don't much feel like going blind in the theatre from the sheer white exposure that takes up 97% of _Midsommar's_ runtime.

530385,Sheldon Nylander,"An impressive work, “Midsommar” is Ari Aster’s follow-up to “Herditary,” a decent if flawed horror film.

“Midsommar” follows Dani, who, after the tragic loss of her parents and sister, decides to follow her increasingly distant boyfriend and his friends on a trip to Sweden to visit the pagan cult commune their roommate, Pelle, grew up in. While seemingly open and friendly, it becomes obvious fairly quickly that something else is going on here. The obvious comparisons to “The Wicker Man” are not uncalled for.

First, in the interest of full disclosure, this review is based on the nearly three-hour Director’s Cut of the film rather than the theatrical release. I haven’t even seen the theatrical release, so I can’t attest as to what was added in the nearly 30 new minutes. I will say that the Director’s Cut is pretty seamless and doesn’t seem to have any superfluous scenes.

Second, we need to start with the elephant in the room and address how this compares to “Hereditary,” which as I stated was okay but flawed. The major flaw in that film is that it has its own internal consistency, but doesn’t have consistency from an audience standpoint. There’s only the most minor of hints as to the truth, and it’s clear that in that world, such things were possible, but the audience isn’t really let in on the answer until the end. The audience has to think about it to get that internal logic. I’m usually the type that doesn’t like spoonfeeding information to the audience, but this withheld a little too much.

Okay, that was “Hereditary.” So how does “Midsommar” compare? Well, it’s far better in terms of letting the audience in on the secret and revealing its internal logic. But, sometimes it’s too good at it. There’s not much of a secret. You know what’s ultimately coming.

However, interestingly this is where the brilliance of the movie actually comes in. Much like life and sex, it’s about the journey, not the destination. We know where we’re going, but the fun is in seeing how we get there. And it’s a fun and colorful journey. This is bright daytime horror, taking place in Sweden at Midsommar when there is very little darkness at night, which itself could be a metaphor in that we can see the end and know where we’re going.

So, why only 4 stars? The film is great, but definitely not perfect and has a couple deep flaws. I could give the film a little more credit if it did conceal the end a little more, giving a less obvious “twist.” The other is that it sticks pretty close to traditional character archetypes for horror films. If you don’t know what I mean, this was very well addressed in “Cabin in the Woods.” A little more variety and a little added creativity could have elevated “Midsommar’s” score. While it’s still great, don’t expect a perfect film.",2019-10-30T07:38:46.905Z,8.0,Midsommar,2019
530385,Wuchak,"_**“The Wicker Man” meets “The Village”**_

Invited by their genial Swedish friend, four college students from New York take a vacation to rural Sweden to experience a Midsummer celebration at a commune. A couple of them are cultural anthropology students, who are naturally interested in the friendly isolated group and their odd ceremonies. The situation goes from friendly and curious to shocking. Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor play the American protagonists.

“Midsommar” (2019) is folk horror that plays out like “The Wicker Man” (1973/2006) meets “The Village” (2004) with elements of “The Lords of Salem” (2012). The topic of visiting a secluded pagan religious community and the increasing challenges thereof can be seen in other flicks like “Ogre” (2008), “The Ritual” (2017) and “Apostle” (2018), as well as the recent Indie “Devil’s Island” (2021). 

If you like these kinds of movies “Midsommar” delivers the goods.  Writer/director Ari Aster did his homework, combining fact with fiction, old and new. There’s an insightful comparison between the lack of social intimacy in modern Western culture and the family-like camaraderie of the remote Commune. Pugh makes for an effective protagonist and there’s some convincing gore. It’s a professionally made piece no doubt.  

Unfortunately, the first half is more compelling than the second, which devolves into tedious ceremonies and the corresponding gobbledygook. Hammer’s “The Mummy” (1959) had the same issue but was mercifully an hour shorter. “Midsommar” needed tightened up for a more gripping viewing experience, but directors generally don’t like to cut scenes from their ‘baby.’ 

The film runs 2 hours, 27 minutes, and was shot in Budakeszi, Hungary (Hårga), as well as Korda Studios, Etyek, and Budapest, Hungary; Dani’s apartment was shot in Brooklyn, New York.

After the mysterious death of her niece Katie, journalist Rachel Keller starts to investigate an urban legend about a videotape which kills you seven days after watching it. With dire consequences coming her way if she can not solve the mystery....

The sentence, English language remake of successful foreign horror film has been known to instill fear of the wrong kind in many a genre fan. So when it was announced that Gore Verbinski was to remake Hideo Nakata's terrifying nerve shredder, Ringu, the reaction in horror circles was akin to someone urinating on your chips. Refreshing to report then that The Ring is a candidate for best American remake and proof positive that remakes sometimes can be a good thing.

Starring Naomi Watts (who is terrific) as Rachel, Verbinski and writer Ehren Kruger (adapting from Kôji Suzuki's novel) successfully transfer the atmospherics of Nakata's piece to a dank and eerie Seattle. It's with atmosphere that The Ring starts to play on your nerves, because after viewing the creepy and unsettling tape itself, we ourselves have been set up for the race against the clock theme that is driving Rachel on. So as the mystery starts to unravel, and sadness threatens to take a hold, the story quickly shifts direction to give horror one of its most baddest and cruelest characters. It's the kind of impact that crawls under your skin and refuses to move when you are trying to sleep at night.

Though the story has been streamlined from its source, The Ring still has a bit too much filler in its meaty structure. Feeling a need to give Watts a quest among quests, Verbinski almost over cooks the mystery essence of the plot. However, with much relief he reins it in to stop any sort of scooby doo like nonsense detracting from the creepy sense of dread that has been built up previously. The ending here works a treat, but it is a tone down from the source and with that it's not even close to Nakata's version, and just maybe it has something to do with Dream Works wanting to secure a PG-13 rating? 

What is left though is a truly suspenseful and unsettling thriller - come horror film. One that even on revisits manages to bother and keep one on the edge of the seat. It made an $80 million profit in America alone, ensuring that a sequel was sure to follow. Now was that one a bad idea! 8/10",2018-10-29T03:11:31.936Z,8.0,The Ring,2002

This one here is an incredibly frustrating King work. A lot of what makes this one so uneven is due to there being a lot to really like about it, a few points to love about it and then there were elements to utterly loathe about it. The film is at it's best with the way the mounting hysteria over the situation with them trapped within the supermarket and how the groups resolve their problems and start new ones which was pretty good and makes for a realistic feeling to the story, detailing how it all breaks down and what the group resorts to in order to keep their sanity. Likewise, that in turn leads into the films' best efforts in the first few attacks with the unknown creatures inside the mist killing off the victims as they refuse to believe what's out there and rush foolishly into the area which makes for a series of fun times out in the cargo hold and the different attempts to reach safety outside and then encountering the different creatures and their powers were all good points. The flying insects and them trying to keep them out as the different creatures break in resulting in a series of great encounters trying to clear them out of the store, and the insane battle in the pharmacy during the pitch-black interior is a rather stark and creepy experience fighting off the array of creatures that gives this one a ton of impressive points. The final few battles and escapes to get out, the blood and gore and the way that the creatures are dealt with are all loved points here as that all leads into the stellar finale which is an absolutely unforeseen and shocking in what goes on as there are some rather disturbing parts in this section. Along with the fine creature effects, these here are the good parts to really love about it although it does have a few issues to be had here. The film's biggest problem is the mere appearance of the religious babble that gets spewed in here which is so wrongheaded and rather off-putting it just makes the viewer feel like not watching it all that often. Yet another big issue here is the length and how overlong it feels, with the rather overlong sections in the middle really making it feel it's length somewhat. While there's plenty to like here, these do hold it back.

The Mist is directed by Frank Darabont and Darabont adapts the screenplay from the story of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Toby Jones, Laurie Holden and Andre Braugher. Music is by Mark Isham and cinematography by Rohn Schmidt.​
​
Residents of a small Maine town become trapped in the local supermarket when an otherworldly mist brings deadly creatures in full attack mode. That's not the only problem, for two groups form inside the market, one in favour of escaping, the other for expiation.

As is the norm, King adaptations vary in quality and divisive fan appraisals, so with ""The Mist"" on screen not exactly setting the box office alight, and it even getting delayed releases in Europe, one would think this is one of the lesser King adapted lights? Not so, in fact, it is now proving to have a longevity of worth in horror fan circles. So much so, that the great horror writer at the literary source gives it the full thumbs up whilst giving the ""changed"" ending his full pat on the back approval.

Darabont is of course the director who previously took King's more human interest stories and crafted much beloved movies out of them, so why was he in the chair to direct a film about alien creatures unleashing bloody dread on small town Americana? Well actually the answer is why ""The Mist"" is such a cunning chilly delight. For this not only features monstrous creatures straight out of a Lovecraft/Barker nightmare, but also the monsters of the human kind, where the venality of the human condition is laid bare under duress, of which it is very frightening.

The alien creatures themselves creep the flesh, ok the effects work sometimes sags under the scrutiny of ""HD"" viewings, but this is nightmarish stuff, none more so than with a quite brilliant and terrifying sequence of events in a pharmacy. Yet it's the human monsters within the supermarket that usurps our creature invaders, where religious fervour and mans propensity for survival comes crashing together for dynamic results - the cast utterly in tune with the material and delivering quality portrayals.

Once the human battles within dissipates, and we come to the resolutions and reasonings of what has caused the creature invasion (hello subtext), we arrive at the much talked about finale. It actually deserves to be divisive, for we don't want yet another horror film finale that has people shrugging their respective shoulders and saying ""fair enough, but is that it?"".

If you buy into the all round bleak tonalities that the pic has been serving throughout, then this ending hits all the right buttons. For sure, this is no easy cop out to send you home with a smile on your face, it's brutal, and crucially it's befitting the word of the genre it sits in - horror. 8.5/10",2019-10-06T02:49:39.855Z,8.0,The Mist,2007

The mist and its Lovecraftianesque creatures are symbolic of humanity's existential dread and the abject fear that there is quite possibly nothing else but this, and the end here is the end forever; or even worse, that what lies beyond is not a benevolent Creator, but rather an entity that either is indifferent to our existence and our plights, or is actively malevolent against us. Jean-Paul Sartre described this fear as ""existential nausea.""

Mrs. Carmody's ever growing religious cult was the very opposite extreme.

But what seemed the logical end result of her many violent transgressions only served to martyr her in the eyes of other extremists -- as it so often does -- and serves, in their twisted minds, as vindication of what they've been preaching all along.

And there are those who simply did the best they could with the circumstances they were given, but in the process, did not sacrifice the wills of others for their own gain while simultaneously giving of themselves unto the service of others. No one can say with absolute certainty what lies in wait beyond this life, but we shouldn't squander the moments we _do_ have on this Earth entombed in fear and letting that fear manipulate us into becoming the monsters we sometimes create ourselves.

The end of this movie has always been, in my opinion, the most tragic. The ending was _almost_ a happy one, if only they'd held out for a few moments longer. But in relation to the underlying theme laid out above, this group of people's break from the store to the car to the literal end of the road was metaphorical of venturing out into the unknown, even if it means leaving the comfort yet unstable illusion of safety and well-being, to take our chances navigating life the best we know how. We may feel as if ultimately the only thing we have any control over is when and how we die, but even this is just another illusion.",2020-11-12T06:12:18.638Z,10.0,The Mist,2007
300669,joshfaknam,"As is typical with almost all movies of this genre I found this film to be predictable and lacking real creativity. It is an unfortunate collision of several popular titles and left me wondering if its writers had just binge watched a weekend of thriller films that made a few bucks before looking at each other through a bongy haze and declaring ""Dude we can totally write a screenplay!"" 
The result is a film that is average at best. Perhaps the audience could also benefit from a little pre-screening bongy haze of their own.",2016-06-07T03:21:58.087Z,,Don't Breathe,2016
300669,Frank Ochieng,"There are several contemporary horror showcases that could certainly benefit from co-writer/director Fede Alvarez’s (“Evil Dead”) edgy home invasion thriller **Don’t Breathe**. For starters, Alvarez taps into the suggestive elements of tension without the overextended need to go overboard. The chills and thrills seem almost organic and unassuming. Sure, there appears to be a simplistic approach to an otherwise conventional premise of a house break-in at the hands of opportunistic thugs. Nevertheless, **Don’t Breathe** captures the claustrophobic spirit of its inherent creepiness with stylish cruelty and cleverness.

Inevitably, **Don’t Breathe** may inspire cinematic comparisons to the 2002 David Fincher-directed vehicle _Panic Room_. Understandably the theme is somewhat recognizable to movie audiences as ominous strangers invading your domestic private space is a recipe for paranoia and persecution. However, **Don’t Breathe** takes this precarious situation to a whole new scare tactic level of horrific proportions. Consequently, the executed violence and terror-driven tempo is definitely worthy of its suspense-driven objectives. **Don’t Breathe** is a macabre masterpiece in the making that sets the standard for a current-day stillborn and repetitive horror genre that thrives on pressure cooker predictability.

The set-up for **Don’t Breathe** is quite ambitious and challenging thus forming an interesting spin on the home robbery scenario. The sordid story centers around three upstart small-time crooks making the rounds of thievery in the suburban surroundings of Detroit. Rocky (Jane Levy) and her two male companions Money and Alex (Daniel Zovatto and Dylan Minnette) are able to carry off their home invasion scamming courtesy of Alex’s connections to a home security firm owned by his father (where there is all kinds of access information to private residences and local businesses).

Alex’s stipulation, however, is that these home invasion robberies need to be less flashy without drawing too much attention. Plus, all the stolen items confiscated much not be too expensive otherwise their illegal activities will be exposed much sooner than later. Unfortunately lovebirds Rocky and Money do not see eye-to-eye with Alex’s brand of careful and cautious home-robbing philosophy. In fact, the romantic couple wants to reach for the sky and steal as much stuff possible to make their dreams of living on East Street an immediate reality. So what will it take for Alex to get on the same page as Rocky and Money in terms of all of them benefiting on a big score without suffering the dire consequences?

The consensus is reached among the law-breaking trio that their next target for viable riches is in the form of a blinded Iraqi war veteran (Stephen Lang). The word is that the personally troubled and sightless ex-military man is about to be awarded a whopping three-hundred thousand dollar cash settlement involving the wrongful death of his beloved young daughter. So the home invasion task seems quite self-explanatory to the young heist-happy hooligans as committing theft against a seemingly vulnerable blind man emotionally and psychologically down in the dumps should be a piece of cake so to speak. Well, Rocky and her two boytoys were sadly mistaken if they thought that they could take sole advantage of this savvy yet disturbed disabled war vet with visions of sorrow and sacrifice.

The realization that the home-invading crew has picked a tricky trap of a house to pillage while underestimating the capabilities of its handicapped owner seems like poetic justice. In fact, the irony of the criminal threesome trying to escape the boarded-up dark and dingy household makes them look like the victimized three blind mice at the mercy of a crazed trigger-happy, sight-deprived ex-soldier that can see all too well that his cherished castle and belongings are being jeopardized by these punkish intrusive violators. Strangely, the audience is left wondering whether or not they should root for the blinded bombshell protecting his homestead of secrets or the clueless crooks that talked themselves into this caustic cat-and-mouse game of gloom-and-doom.

**Don’t Breathe** is uncharacteristically compelling for a horror showcase because it relies on genuine scary jolts and jumps…or at least the anticipation of the jolts and jumps that have convincing dramatic weight behind the build up of intensity. Alvarez crafts an arousing narrative that brilliantly displays the mounting nervousness that awaits. Lang’s belligerent blind man patrols every spacing and crevice in the darkness with the will of a rabid dog in heat as he points his explosive firearms at the slightest movements of his trapped guinea pigs in despair. Creatively nerve-racking and nauseous, **Don’t Breathe** makes dutiful usage of its instinctual delivery of shock value as this potent pot-boiler never settles for any sense of false or mechanically manufactured hedonism. The haunting aura that exists in **Don’t Breathe** is gasping in visceral authenticity.

As the menacing misfit saddled by wartime mortar fire blindness but blessed with tactical tenacity drenched in borderline villainy, Lang’s portrayal as the sightless hunter tracking down his vulnerable prey in his tortured domestic playground is solidly digestible. His inner madness was already established by personalized heartbreak but the arrival of his uninvited guests devilishly unleashed more demons within his off-kilter psyche. The moving targets at the other end of the deranged blind man’s intimidating gun are thoroughly convincing as the harried catalysts for their sightless tormentor’s frustration and escalating rage. Levy’s Rocky, Zovatto’s Money and Minnette’s Alex are plausible as the frightened specimens caught in the maniacal maze of their aggressor’s clutches.

The very thought of a psychotic blind man enforcing his brand of warped justice on the youthfully sighted self-indulgent saps is deliciously manipulative and wonderfully inventive. The creepy corners concerning the backlash blackness in **Don’t Breathe** is explored with grand naughtiness and the atmospheric vibes certainly will not disappoint in this percolating peek-a-boo primer.

300669,Gimly,"2016 has been a great year for horror. With the addition of _Don't Breathe_, 3 of my top 5 movies the past 9 months are in the genre. I'm a pretty huge horror fan but even for me that is crazy unexpected.

Director Fede Alvarez has knocked it out of the park with _Don't Breathe_.  In fact I'm yet to be anything other than impressed by his work (not that notable an achievement, as he's only directed two films, but still). _Don't Breathe_ flips a lot of modern horror conventions, and I love it for that. The use of silence and barely audible noise to bring the scares instead of some cheap blaring-ly loud audio. The fact that there is really no one wholly good or wholly evil.... Plus that puppy is really bloody cute...

It's a great comeback for the director after his first film, 'Evil Dead' remake had got a mixed response. This film might feel very familiar to you if you have got a good knowledge of the B movies. It was still a very refreshing and very thrilling. The film was short, because there were none segments wasted, it comes to the point quickly. I mean the event, because the story was a one liner, but the event was what this film based on.

Three youngsters who rob the houses when the people are out, mark their new target on a blind war veteran. But when it does not go as they have planned, they find trapped inside his house. Struggling to escape from there, they also get so close to what they had come for. Though it becomes a suicidal, and left without any option, what's next for them and the result of their attempt is what becomes the film's conclusion.

Really a great effort. Almost a one night based theme with the limited cast. The title is not just what the film revolves, it also for us to hold breath while watching it and most probably sitting on the edge of our seat throughout. But I'm very disappointed with many flaws, or maybe you can say those unexplained stuffs. Like the end seems very silly, because there were lots of evidence to prove the film character had committed a crime, but easily got out. Likewise there are many more, but the film does not explain and I believe there are sure reasons behind them.

The writers did not care to waste time on those, because they wanted only a thriller, a non-stop one and they got one. Now it is going to be remade in Kollywood and also a sequel was announced. I expected that when I saw the ending. Maybe, a prequel, though sequel seems more interesting idea after what happened in this. Surely one of the best thriller of the year, so make sure you watch it soon.

What starts as a typical home invasion thriller transforms into anything, but when the blind elderly man the thieves thought would be an easy mark turns out to be a vicious killer, Don't Breathe becomes something so much better. With suspense and tension similar to A Quiet Place, characters desperately fight to hold their breath and avoid making any sound so the deadly blind man can't find and kill them. Don't Breathe is visceral, brutal, and claustrophobic. In such a small, confined space, the anxiety never fades because the killer is literally in the room with his potential victims. There is one particularly disturbing scene near the end, so I recommend looking up a parents guide before you commit to watching if you aren't a frequent horror enthusiast.

It's also worth noting that the success of this movie - an R rated vampire flick with an African American lead - gave birth to the comic book movie era. The action, effects, and music are silly and dated, plus the story makes no sense. But Blade is nevertheless still fun.",2019-03-09T21:07:13.159Z,5.0,Blade,1998
36647,Gimly,"First released in 1998, Blade brought commercial success back to Super Hero films, after the woeful distribution of films like Batman & Robin and Steel stopped the genre in its tracks.

Starring Wesley Snipes as the eponymous Half-Vampire/Half-Human hybrid come Super Hero/Vampire Hunter, Blade works with Dr. Karen Jensen and Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) in order to defeat vampires Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) and Quinn (Donal Logue) and their host of undead soldiers before they can kill Gitano Dragonetti (Udo Kier) and the other vampire Elders in a ritual that will transform Deacon Frost into La Magra, the vampire Blood God.

With me so far? No? That figures. The script's interesting, but it's not terribly sense-making. What I mean to say, is, the script's rubbish, but the *story* is great. The whole film is really rather story and effects driven, but the characters are pretty lacking. Quinn is sort of fun, and Deacon's... well... he's attractive, but not a lot else. Still, there's more to him than most of the characters, including the titular Blade.

Straight up, just putting out there, I think goth-culture is attractive, so, my aesthetics may go quite a way to influencing my decision in the final score, if you disagree with me, you might want to keep that in mind, seeing as most vampires have at least a little bit of that going on. All that aside though, the opening of Blade is one of the strongest ways a film can start off that I've ever seen. It has basically everything you could want for a modern vampire tale. Including the Blood Rave song, Confusion (Pump Panel Remix) by New Order.

The cinematography was another cool point, lots of ins and outs in a non-nauseating way. Although the fight choreography suffered from a serious case of ""Only-One-Guy-Attacks-At- A-Time"" Syndrome. Come on guys, this ain't Tekken. When there's an army to fight, fight an army. Maybe not all at once, I know that could get a tad pointless, but it really didn't transfer well in this film.

To end with, there's one plot-hole I'd like to bring up, I don't think I'll be spoiling anything too badly, but if you want to go in completely fresh, stop reading. There's one point when Frost says he needs to kill the 12 Elder vamps in a big underground ritual in order to complete his ascendancy into the Blood God (Khorne?), but he kills the leader earlier, on a beach. Okay, so maybe he wasn't counted, and he was actually number 13. But, Frost's lady-friend Mercury kills another with Blade's sword, before the ritual gets started, and nobody seems to care... I am dubious- faced.

After all that though, Blade is a vampire film that's not slow like Nosferatu, and not indescribably awful like Twilight, so for people with tastes like mine, it's certainly worth a geez.

Half human and half vampire, Blade's function in life is to rid the world of vampires, he is driven forward by the notion that his mother was killed by his half brethren.

This is no ordinary vampire film, this is nothing to do with bearing crosses and creatures making music of the night, this is armoured weaponry, dazzling swordplay and a protagonist that is as cool as anything that has leaped off of the comic book page. Wesley Snipes (perfect piece of casting) is Blade, a much troubled superhero (aren't they all?), he has to take a formula suppressant to keep away his inner vampire cravings. Aided by trusty pal, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), they wage war against all blood suckers and here they must stop the sinister Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) from executing his monstrous plan.

There are no cranial pondering's here in this piece, this is a joyously high velocity action horror movie, containing great choreography and retaining its comic book heart. Blade is pure popcorn fodder for the MTV generation, in fact director Stephen Norrington utilises his music video background to great effect as the combat scenes are scored with delightful sledgehammer precision. Blood brains and gore flow freely as the film hurtles towards the head splitting conclusion, loud, dark and tinged with brooding menace, Blade is hugely recommended for a ripper of a night in. 7.5/10",2020-04-14T02:06:30.004Z,8.0,Blade,1998

Finally, the vampire council decide it is time to rid themselves of their nemesis and so ""Deacon Frost"" (Stephen Dorff) is tasked with bringing him down. I was always a fan of Dorff - never the best actor, but he had a bit of presence on screen - a good looking bit of rough, I suppose - and here is is a good counterpoint to the fastidious man-in-black whom he is out to destroy. The fight scenes are too choreographed for me, way too much acrobatics that detract from the menace of the story - it's supposed by about vampires, not rhythmic gymnastics - but it still moves along well as ""Frost"" tries to summon the blood god ""La Magra"" to give him the ultimate power to defeat our hero. This doesn't hang about, the action is fast-paced and the effects and characterisations gel quite well together for an enjoyable, if predictable story that is by far the best of the sequels it spawned.",2023-08-28T04:56:37.212Z,6.0,Blade,1998

I evidently knew little about these films, I was anticipating a relatively standard yet stylish superhero flick - based upon the lead character's look, which is the only thing I knew of.

That's not a criticism, as the vampire stuff ended up being pretty fun to watch unfold. I will say that Wesley Snipes is the reason for that fact though, as Stephen Dorff and his band of one-dimensional renegades are only just narrowly watchable. Snipes as the titular character is excellent though, while Kris Kristofferson and N'Bushe Wright are good too.

The special effects haven't aged the best, though some parts are still decent and, to be honest, even the less than good pieces still work. For example the effect used when the vampires are killed looks fine, though the end with Frost's blood does look a bit dorky now - but again, works.",2025-01-04T13:31:39.858Z,7.0,Blade,1998

Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, Bone Tomahawk stars Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins and Lili Simmons. Music is by Zahler and Jeff Herriott and cinematography by Benji Bakshi.

Ah, yes, the horror western hybrid, a most difficult thing to get right at the best of times, even harder to entice newcomers to the sub-genre splice if they don't particularly like horror or westerns! This is a tough sell, a pic of startling originality, but of homage worthiness as well, that it kind of feels like a film made for a secret society of film fans. A society perhaps like the Troglodyte tribe who dominate the horror aspect of this particular tale.

Plot is set in the wild west, where after a set of circumstances leads to the kidnapping of three people from the local jail - by members of the Troglodyte tribe, four men set off on a rescue mission...

How splendid to find a narrative that isn't afraid to nod towards one of the most revered westerns of all time, yet be its own entity at the same time. Bone Tomahawk will polarise opinions, no question about it, the whole middle section involves a travelogue pumped by characterisations and a need to set the stage for what will occur in the final third. However, to even think that the four horsemen of the apocalypse bulk of this movie is mere slow time cinema is unfair, for dark comedy is at work - a racist horse? Surely not?. 

So the screenplay not only sparkles with wit, but it also pulses with drama, drama that comes from human stubbornness. Be it men who know that no matter what will happen, they will maybe die in honour due to mistakes or mismanagement, or just a matter of redemption, this mission on the surface seems pure folly, but in reality there is more at work here. And thus comes the horror, characters have been well formed, we know them and are interested in what will happen to them. Like or dislike is irrelevant, we bloody know them, so as the film hits its raging ""B"" movie straps, shouting at the screen or wincing in harmony becomes a requisite. As is squirming...

Intricately paced, beautifully photographed and splendidly performed by a top cast who aren't interested in top billing or walk of fame recognition, Bone Tomahawk is a grade ""A"" culter. Zahler could be someone to keep an eye on. 9/10",2016-02-14T17:15:56.656Z,9.0,Bone Tomahawk,2015

This was one of the three western films I've watched back to back recently. The other two were 'The Salvation' and 'The Homesman'. They all were totally different from each other and I enjoyed them a lot. I did not know what this title means, but I learnt it before going for it which means some kind of axe used by the American Indians. So I have waited for that moment to know why the film's called that and then, omg, I was very shocked, totally uncomfortable to watch that part. I felt like it was a western version of 'The Hills Have Eyes'.

This was a road movie. A group of peoples' journey to rescue those who were abducted by some mountain tribes. The rescue was the third act and the rest of the film was about how they make into that remote place. Obviously a slow pace, makes you sit whatever position you want, but after the 90 minutes you will be more focused than before as the narration gets tense. The best part of the film in any western the audience were looking for finally arrives. It was a simple, but very strong and disturbing.

The cast was the plus point, everyone did their part best. Even the music and the locations were very nice and appropriate. One of the rare western films I've seen, with a mix of horror-terror. This is the cheapest film and shot within a month of time, but a fine production and completely unexpected film. Possible for a sequel, but I think that's not a good idea unless it retains the same crew. If you're okay with a slow narration, then you will enjoy it. Compared to the opening, when it ends, you will feel satisfied. It is not a greatest western of all time, but still worth a watch.

In the 1890s, four men in the Southwest -- a sheriff (Kurt Russell), his aged deputy (Richard Jenkins), a gunslinger (Matthew Fox) and a wounded cowboy foreman (Patrick Wilson) -- set out to bring back captives kidnapped by a mysterious nameless tribe that lives several days ride away. Lili Simmons plays the cattleman’s wife while David Arquette plays a trashy outlaw. Sid Haig has a small role in the opening.

“Bone Tomahawk” (2015) has a surprisingly good cast for an Indie Western that only cost $1.8 million and shot in 21 days. It was the first film written/directed by S. Craig Zahler and reveals a master filmmaker in that he was able to make a quality movie on such a low-budget. The film has the confidence to take its time with interesting characters and entertaining mundane dialogues, which is reminiscent of Tarantino. There are flashes of violence, but this is a slow-burn Western that builds to a rewarding climax.

It’s a unique Western that meshes the Tarantino-style with realistically mundane Westerns like “The Homesman” (2014) and horrific gritty Indies like “Cry Blood, Apache” (1970). It’s superior to the latter two, especially “Cry Blood,” but it’s not quite in the ballpark of Tarantino due to lack of funds. Yet it ain’t far off either. 

The movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, and was shot at Paramount Ranch, Agoura, California.

There were so many things to dislike, hate, and/or projectile-vomit from this ghastly horror that I am a little embarrassed about how I couldn't wait to grab some alone time to watch Bone Tomahawk.  This is a gorge-suppressingly awful movie that is too long, more tedious than suspenseful, and features a man getting scalped, strangled, and split in two, crotch to chops.  I thought the water buffalo in Apocalypse Now had it easier.

The movie vaguely reminded me of John McTiernan's The Thirteenth Warrior (with a dash of Quest for Fire).  In TTW, an Arab diplomat hooks a ride with Beowulf and his posse.  The blood flows like spaghetti sauce as the ""Geats"" fight it out with a tribe of spider-worshipping Neandernasties. 
 
Here, a mini-posse of 1890s Southwesterners go on a rescue mission into desert badlands held by a pack of ""Trogladytes.""  Where McTiernan drives the narrative at a bone-crushing pace, Bone Tomahawk crushes bones, slices scalps and genetalia, and makes the characters almost impossible to like.  Kurt Russell, a man who has a voice as gritty as his stare is cold, is so restrained that the fire he brought to Tombstone is almost snuffed out.  

I suspect the movie tried to present the good guys as flawed and believable, but we get tired of endless trudging through the outback of the Southwest while the characters use arcane language.

As I'm writing this, I'm slowly changing my mind about the blandness of the characters.  Maybe they are, in their own way, working-class anti-heroes, but I just wanted a bit more savagery on the part of the ""good guys.""

As you should know by now, I avoid trailers at all costs, especially for highly anticipated movies. I'm careful enough already, but once I heard the massive complaints about the trailer for The Invisible Man, I made sure to not even listen to it, let alone see something from it. My expectations got higher as the release date approached, and the overwhelmingly positive reactions reached my attention, so obviously, I couldn't help but get excited. I love The Handmaid's Tale, and I always thought it was a matter of time until Elisabeth Moss brought her phenomenal acting skills to the big screen. She just needed a big film to do it...

And this is the one. Elisabeth's performance is yet another horror display for The Academy to ignore when the year comes to a close. In comparison to Hereditary's Toni Colette or Us' Lupita Nyong' o, I admit that I would give an Oscar to one of these two over Moss. However, this is one of the main issues I have when people compare things from different years: it's extremely unfair and a bit irrational. Something ""great"" in a specific year can be just ""okay"" in the next one. It depends on each year's quality regarding movies and their cast's performances.

If Moss truly ends up delivering the best interpretation of the year, she should receive recognition independently of other year's injustices. With that said, based on my experience, I firmly believe Elisabeth Moss should be one of the contenders for the respective category during the awards season. I'm not saying she should be nominated or not, I'm saying that she should be one to think of when it's time to fill the ballot with the nominees. She is relentlessly exceptional during the whole runtime. There isn't a single moment where she drops her level. Impressive!

Regarding the story, it's probably the best adaptation of The Invisible Man to the actual world that they could have done. Of all the meaningful and sensitive real-world themes, Leigh Whannell chose the very best to insert in his film. Domestic violence and abuse is a tremendously serious topic, and Whannell addresses it perfectly. It's a remarkably clever screenplay, with tons of tiny little details that relate in some shape or form to the real-life situations a lot of people (women AND men, let's not pretend this is an exclusively female problem) go through.

It's one of the best horror movies I've seen lately when it comes to creating a suspenseful, scary environment, mostly based on something that feels incredibly realistic. Taking the sci-fi aspect of, well, dealing with an invisible person, the menacing silence and haunting score work as well as they do because I'm able to feel the protagonist's fear. Stefan Duscio's cinematography is one of the main reasons why this film is filled with so much efficient suspense. The camera constantly pauses on one side of the room the character's in, lingering on for some seconds, creating a certain doubt if something's moving or if someone's there.

This point-of-view (POV) shot works exceptionally well for the whole movie. Being able to see what the main character is seeing, it's also possible to think what she's thinking and feel what she's feeling. That awkward, frustrating, unnerving, uneasy feeling that something's not right. Then, Whannell proves he knows his film's own weaknesses. When it starts to lose a bit of its entertainment value, and when the audience begins to get used to the long, suspenseful sequences (of which probably half, nothing happens), he hits the narrative with an unexpected, shocking turn of events in the most jaw-dropping way possible.

This particular decision got the blood heavily pumping again, and it delivered the energy I needed to be at the edge of my seat until the very end. However, the ending is a tad underwhelming, and maybe a bit over-the-top concerning some character's decisions. I can't really get into spoiler territory, so I'll just write I don't really think that the last scene is very coherent with everything the movie showed until that point. Even though I understand and respect this narrative decision, I don't believe its message is the one the film wanted to transmit. Good performances from the rest of the cast, a few character's decisions are a bit hard to believe, but I don't want to be nitpicky.

In the end, The Invisible Man deserves all the hype it's been getting. Leigh Whannell crafted a genuinely scary and extremely suspenseful horror movie, based on a traumatic real-life situation that a lot of people, unfortunately, go through. Elisabeth Moss delivers an emotionally powerful performance, demonstrating all of her impressive acting abilities which are probably going to be ignored when the awards season comes around (the usual horror genre bias). Incredibly well-written, intelligent screenplay, supported by some terrific camera work by Stefan Duscio. The haunting score from Benjamin Wallfisch is also a standout, especially when it chooses to be completely silent. I'm not a fan of the slightly incoherent ending since some character/narrative decisions seem hard to believe, and the final message didn't really have the meaning it should. Nevertheless, it's one of the best films of the year so far, so don't miss it!

>_I went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable. No doubt invisibility made it possible to get them, but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got._

- H.G. Wells; _The Invisible Man_ (1897)

H.G. Wells's original _The Invisible Man_ (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be used to fulfil private desires, ultimately leading to the moral corruption of otherwise good men. In probably the best cinematic adaptation, Paul Verhoeven's _Hollow Man_ (2000), this is taken much further, with the suggestion that the results of invisibility would be nothing less than sexual violence, evil, and madness. However, despite the centrality of this theme in the core story, reframing the template as a modern tale of domestic abuse and PTSD, as happens in this latest adaptation, is a fascinating idea. Reorienting the narrative so it no longer focuses on the male scientist but on a female victim of his machinations creates the potential for some timely #MeToo social commentary, particularly as it relates to issues of not believing women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting. But potential only gets you so far, and what could have been a really insightful film eventually proves itself relatively incapable of using issues of domestic abuse as anything other than plot points to get from one predictable scare to the next. It tries to have its cake and eat it – it wants to be an allegory for the problems women face leaving abusive relationships but it also wants to be an effective monster movie. And, ultimately, it ends up as neither.

The film begins as Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) is putting into motion a plan to leave her domineering and abusive boyfriend, Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), a wealthy pioneer in optics. Having drugged him, she leaves their high-tech home in the middle of the night and is picked up nearby by her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer), who takes her to stay with their childhood friend, James Lanier (Aldis Hodge), a policeman living with his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Although assured that Adrian can't find her, Cecilia is clearly suffering from agoraphobia and paranoia. That is until Adrian commits suicide. Contacted by his brother Tom (Michael Dorman), who's handling his estate, Cecilia learns that Adrian has left her $5 million. However, despite her best efforts to move on, she just can't shake the feeling that Adrian is still around, watching her, sometimes even in the same room as her. And the surer she becomes that he's not dead, the more everyone else becomes worried about her mental well-being.

Written and directed by Leigh Whannell (co-creator of the _Saw_ franchise and creator of the _Insidious_ franchise), this latest adaptation of Wells's original is not actually about the invisible man. Indeed, short of a background shot of him lying in bed, a shot showing only his torso as he runs through a forest, and a close-up of his hand, actor Oliver Jackson-Cohen doesn't even appear on screen prior to his apparent suicide. Adrian is not only the invisible man of the plot, so too is his character ideologically invisible. Which makes its own statement, and it's a statement worth making – men like him don't need to be present to continue to cause harm; years of abuse will carry on their work even if they're no longer around. In this sense, at least initially, the film is more concerned with the fear Adrian has instilled in Cecilia; in the early stages, Cecilia's main enemy isn't Adrian so much her inability to move on from him. Along the same lines, the film looks at issues of how women who accuse powerful men of gaslighting are often ignored or openly disbelieved. It is, of course, allegorical insofar as Cecilia isn't claiming that Adrian is just gaslighting her, she's claiming that he's literally turned himself invisible to drive her insane, but some of the best allegory works by exaggeration, and/or rendering something abstract as something more tangible.

Aesthetically, the film looks terrific. Designed by Alex Holmes (_Wish You Were Here_; _The Babadook_; _The Nightingale_), Adrian's house is a modernist maze of glass, mirrors, sliding panels, and open space, and the ultra-high-tech nerve centre from which he controls his kingdom is one of the film's only overt nods to science fiction (aside from the whole invisibility thing, of course). The real aesthetic strength, however, is the cinematography by Stefan Duscio (_Jungle_; _Upgrade_; _Judy & Punch_), into which is built Cecilia's paranoia. For example, countless scenes involve the camera panning away from her, moving across the room, showing us nothing at all, and then panning back. Ordinarily, this would be textbook unmotivated camera movement, but here it conveys how Cecelia fears there may be something in the corner to which we panned. And now, thanks to that camera pan, so do we. There are also many shots which in another film would be awful framing; isolating Cecilia in the frame and filling up so much of the screen's real-estate with empty negative space. Except, again, in this film, such negative space has an ominousness not applicable to regular thrillers. In this way, Whannell can instil fear and dread simply by pointing the camera at an empty room without the need for any FX, VFX, makeup, elaborate props etc (which no doubt played a significant role in keeping the budget down to a minuscule $7 million). And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Moss's performance, which is excellent, especially given that so much of it is her on her own reacting to nothing whatsoever, having to communicate confusion, fear, anger etc through little more than her expression.

Before talking about why I didn't like the film, however, I want to reiterate that I honestly can't say how much I admire the idea to reconstitute the genre template as a story about domestic violence. And it's an especially timely reconstitution, coming as it does in the era of #MeToo, when so many powerful men, once considered invisible in everything but name, able to perpetrate their crimes with impunity, have been revealed as the monsters they are. So I have no problem with the ideological paradigm shift. My problem is with the execution. 

For one thing, we know from the get-go that Cecilia isn't imagining things, that Adrian faked his suicide and is now stalking her whilst invisible. This isn't a twist, and the film makes no attempt to hide it. Granted, this is kind of unavoidable given how well-known the property is, but had the film allowed for even a little bit of ambiguity, it could have done wonders for emotional complexity, turning a story about invisibility into a story possibly about mental collapse. This would have effectively placed the audience in the same position as the other characters, doubting Cecilia's state of mind, which would, in turn, have enhanced the potency of the socio-political allegory. Another thing that bothered me is that in a film so focused on surveillance and privacy, there are several scenes where if there is even one functioning CCTV camera, the movie ends. A pivotal scene in a restaurant is an especially egregious example of this – one grainy image from a camera, and Cecilia can prove she's not going nuts and the whole plot unravels. Also, if you were so convinced that you were being stalked by someone invisible, might it not occur to you to invest in a pair of IR glasses for a few hundred bucks on Amazon? Just a thought.

However, my biggest problem is that what starts as a fascinating study of the lasting ramifications of domestic violence ultimately descends into genre stupidity, with a ridiculously over-the-top final act that says nothing of interest about anything. True, _Hollow Man_ has a pretty over-the-top final act too, but _Hollow Man_ never saw itself as anything other than a schlocky genre affair, whereas _The Invisible Man_ clearly does. The fact that Whannell ultimately undermines himself in this way, deploying such important themes merely to get him to the gory _dénouement_, is especially frustrating insofar as he genuinely did originally seem to have some interesting things to say. Tied to this is that Adrian is introduced as such an abhorrent character from the start; he's essentially a comic book villain, void of nuance or subtlety. Domestic abusers aren't monotone evil-doers, otherwise everyone would see through then. Oftentimes, they're very charming on the surface, and any film claiming to be a serious examination of this topic would make room to address this.

Although _The Invisible Man_ was very well reviewed and a huge box-office hit, it left me disappointed and frustrated. Initially positioning itself as an insightful allegory for the difficulty victims of domestic abuse have in moving on with their lives even after the abuser is gone, it eventually privileges genre beats and cheap thrills over emotional complexity. Which is a huge shame and a massively missed opportunity.",2020-03-14T03:42:46.486Z,4.0,The Invisible Man I,2020
570670,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"It seems that you can teach an old dog new tricks, at least when it comes to classic Universal monster movies. Writer / director Leigh Whannell‘s suspenseful reboot and reimagining of “The Invisible Man” is smart, well-acted, and full of thrills. It’s a surprisingly fresh take on dated source material.

Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) is trapped in a violent, controlling relationship with her wealthy scientist husband Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). After drugging him one night, the terrified woman escapes and disappears, hiding at a policeman friend’s (Aldis Hodge) house. Overcome with loneliness, Adrian commits suicide — but Cecilia suspects his death is a hoax. After a series of creepy coincidences that eventually turn lethal, Cecilia’s sanity begins to unravel as she tries desperately to prove she’s being haunted and hunted by an invisible force that happens to be her departed ex.

By telling the story from the woman’s point of view, Whannell has given the film a contemporary feminist spin that makes it all the more haunting and effective. It’s scary because the details of mental abuse by a partner feels so real, as the manipulation and controlling behavior feeds Cecilia’s paranoia. It’s one of the more chilling horror films (or rather, monster movies) that’s come along in quite a while.

Moss makes her performance look effortless as she wrestles with an empty corner of a room or throws punches into the air. Casting a talented actor in the lead role makes all the difference and prevents this from becoming just another hokey Blumhouse production.

Although serious themes like domestic abuse and mental illness are tackled in an honest way, “The Invisible Man” is so entertaining because it achieves the right mix of terror and female empowerment.",2020-03-27T01:48:28.543Z,7.0,The Invisible Man I,2020

570670,jackcarlin18,"> **_Review on Horror Focus_**

Director Leigh Whannell had a crisp and clear vision when adapting this classic Universal monster The Invisible Man, into a modern re-telling that taps into the relevantly dark dangers of a domestic relationship, exploring such a theme with the upmost intensity and craft. This is a classic horror tale adapted with a contemporary twist, focusing more on the psychological mayhem we're forced to endure, much like our protagonist Cecilia, who's tormented in chilling manners. Already within 2020 this is the sleeper-hit of the year, one that on paper looks a lot more naff than what we are actually presented with.

Moss is the core of the movie here, playing as the heartbeat of the entire duration. Through Whannell and Moss' talent combined we are forced to endure emotional and brutal intensity, throwing its audiences and main protagonist through nerve-wrecking intensity, tapping into the fear of the unseen that worked so well with the likes of It Follows. 

Moss' performance as Cecilia is superb, as her portrayal of unhinged woman broken from domestic abuse is both unsettling and devastating, already leading to one of strongest female lead performances of the year so far. Whilst the portrayal of constant angst is unforgettable, it's her balanced likability that keeps Cecilia so fascinating, without the character ever compromising her morals or intelligence. A character like this is refreshing to see, especially when they ultimately get their moment to redeems themselves, which she absolutely does.

Image result for the invisible man 2020
The most successful element of The Invisible Man is undoubtately the chilling, ice-cold intensity, delivering an unshakable tautness that will have your cage rattles until the closing credits. Whannell's lever use of cinematography with large concrete open spaces and a washed-out colour palette enhances the presence of the Invisible Man himself, allowing paranoia and angst to trickle through bit by bit until it reaches an un-palpable level of tension. Even though we can't see him, his presence is truly unsettling, and once we do, like a bucket of paint to the face, we are then treated to more than a few effective jump scares. Less is more, and The Invisible Man surely capitalises on this, rinsing its novelty for everything its got, for maximum fear factor.

Behind this creepy facade is an intelligent thriller, that after the half-way mark begins to toy with the narratives origins, often hoodwinking the audience until credits role. There is flare to Whannell's direction here, as some of the themes being juggled around here could very easily have resulted in a cheesy and half-baked result, which to my surprise wasn't the case. In fact, the entire film and premise could have so easily been a disaster, and on paper shouldn't really hold up. To my surprise and probably yours, it's way more effective and haunting than I ever would have given it credit for.

With a runtime of nearly two hours, it's surprising how The Invisible Man never feels like it's dragging, nor does it ever let up on the tension. In fact, the movie progressively get more and more unhinged and intense as the movie goes on, and only until the very end do we ever get a second to settle or breathe.

This is what great horror movie experiences are about, and like every great horror experience it is easy to forgive and forget its mishaps. Moss' depiction of Cecilia is fantastic, there is no denying that, however it's perhaps the character itself who could have benefited slightly from more depth. More details on exactly what she would have endured or more clarity in her mental decay could have packed a stronger emotional punch overall. In saying this, when we witness her ultimate and long overdue redemption, it is superbly satisfying. Ask the girls who cheered in the audience, they'll agree with me.

Finally deciding to break free of their small town existence, handymen Val and Earl find that it's easier said than done. The reason? Giant underground worms are attacking the place and they are now needed more than ever.

The 50s ream of sci-fi schlockers and creaky creature features are, depending on your persuasion, either genius fun or tacky nuisances. Since I belong to the first group, Tremors is possibly one of the finest homages to a most wonderful time in cinema. What is often ignored is that those 50s film's deal with the paranoia of the time, with nuclear testing and a wondering appertaining to Roswell like alien visits being very prominent in honest Joe's thoughts. So it be that Tremors is ideally set out in the desert, a place from where all manner of terrifying things have come forward to announce a threat to the American way of life.

We are in the small town of Perfection, a place that may be small on residents, but very much large on character. We have dim wits, annoying kid, cutesy single mom types, Mr and Mrs Rambo and courtesy of Finn Carter's seismologist Rhonda LeBeck, a romantic and charmingly fun filled thread. Containing dashes of gore and reams of cheeky suspense, Tremors proudly wears its ""B"" movie heart on its sleeve. While in Fred Ward (Earl) and Kevin Bacon (Val) the genre possibly has its greatest pairing. As male buddy buddy combos go, these pair take the cake. Funny and full of devilish derring do, Tremors deserves to be watched for this partnership if nothing else - yes they are that good! The creatures are well designed and prove to be a scary and enjoyable foe, whilst the Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, California location is perfectly utilised by cinematographer Alexander Gruszynski. Directed by Ron Underwood on his feature film debut, Tremors also sees Reba McEntire, Michael Gross and Victor Wong also along for this fun packed ride. 8/10",2019-09-19T23:07:12.613Z,8.0,Tremors,1990

Two handymen working in a Southwest town (Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward) team-up with a seismologist (Finn Carter) and the townspeople (e.g. Michael Gross & Reba McEntire) to take on huge creatures that live underground and like to eat people. 	 

“Tremors” (1990) is a desert creature feature similar to “Gargoyles” (1972), but with a less grave tone; there’s a somewhat light air, but it’s not a comedy. The cast is spirited and likable while the creatures are inventive and interesting. Unfortunately, they’re also unbelievable since the hard desert ground would have to have the texture of thick mud for these behemoths to so easily travel through. 

If you can overlook this, however, it’s a fun monster flick with magnificent desert cinematography. Yet it’s nothing more than that and so plays tediously on repeat viewings. “Gargoyles” is all-around superior because it’s more cryptic, grave and streamlined.    

Finn Carter is a highlight in a girl-next-door kind of way, particularly her brief de-panted scene (lol). Meanwhile Gross is reminiscent of Dennis Weaver while McEntire is a natural as the gun-toting hick woman.

The film performed modestly at the box office, but eventually became a cult hit, followed by several sequels.   

It runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Olancha & Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, California.

1992,Wuchak,"***Black comedy/thriller/horror about biochemically-birthed zombie outbreak in central Texas***

Created by writer/director Robert Rodriguez, “Planet Terror” was originally part of the double feature called “Grindhouse,” released in 2007.  The other movie was “Death Proof” by Quentin Tarantino. Both were standalone stories, although vaguely connected. They were a deliberate attempt to recreate the experience of a double feature at a B movie house in the mid/late 60s-70s with the prints intentionally marred by scratches and blemishes or, in this flick, a whole reel supposedly missing. Trailers for fake movies, like “Machete,” were also part of the package.

The plot of “Planet Terror” involves a biochemical outbreak in central Texas that (big surprise) turns people into zombies and the ragtag group that teams-up to fight ’em, led by Freddy Rodríguez and Michael Biehn, the latter a sheriff. Hotties Rose McGowan and Marley Shelton are on hand, the former acquiring a machine gun implant in replace of her amputated leg. (How exactly she pulls the trigger to massacre zombies is anyone’s guess).

The movie comes across as a melding of “Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!” (1965), “Night of the Living Dead” (1968) and “Dawn of the Dead” (1978), but with the modern tone of “Slither” (2006) with its gross, deliberately offensive black humor. McGowan is a highlight throughout, especially her opening go-go sequence whereas Freddy Rodriguez is surprisingly formidable. Their romantic arc is kind o’ touching. Another point of interest is the quality cast, rounded out by the likes of Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Naveen Andrews and Fergie.

At the end of the day, though, “Planet Terror” fails to rise above the low-budget sorta-genius of Syfy schlock like “Flu Bird Horror” (2008), “Wyvern” (2009) and “Sasquatch Mountain” (2006) even though it cost literally twelve times as much. Go figure.

The film runs 1 hour, 45 minutes and was shot in central Texas (Austin and Luling, which is 22 miles south of Austin) and Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico.

1992,The Movie Diorama,"Planet Terror failed to terrorise with its blood-bubble bursting infestation. The first feature of Rodriguez/Tarantino’s homage to the “Grindhouse” exploitation genre, is one that exercises the practical magic of independently produced B-movies. No dramatic theatricality to be seen here, on the misty darkened roads of rural Texas where “Fergalicious” Fergie screams the countryside down whilst being devoured by infected military units. This is Planet Terror, baby. The only quality that matters is the amount of bloodshed that splatters onto the screen. Rodriguez may have directed, produced, written, scored, edited and shot the entire feature, he seemingly tried too hard in replicating the exploitation aesthetic that, if you strip away the grainy filter, comes across as a mildly engaging experiment. A one-legged Go-Go dancer, her legendary ex-boyfriend, and a plethora of other survivors, make battle with a zombie horde that have been infected with a biochemical agent known as “Project Terror”.

I saw it in the poster. You’ve seen it in the poster. We’ve all seen it in the poster. McGowan, with the stance of a badass, equipped with an assault rifle as a leg. That’s the level of awesome stupidity we are dealing with here, and to say I craved it would be an understatement. Rodriguez had the freedom to construct a feature so devilishly fun, that it could’ve been absolutely non-sensical and still be thoroughly entertaining. This is the genre where all rules are broken. Literally! Yet I found myself restrained to the confinement of my sofa. Why? Well, Planet Terror barbecued itself by never letting go. Something was constantly weighing down the feature, and I just can’t put my finger on it. The acting smelt of mild cheddar as opposed to stinking bishop. Aside from a few quotable lines, mostly from El Wray, Rodriguez’ screenplay was forgettable and largely an unfocused mess. For example, the sub-plot involving Brolin’s stern doctor character failed to inject any characterised purpose other than to pad out the runtime. But as soon as McGowan acquired that machine gun, catapulted herself into the air (beautifully terrible green screen and all...) and decimated the zombie horde ahead. Bam! That’s when Planet Terror worked! Piloting a helicopter at a slant so that the propeller decapitates the infected? Yes! Tarantino attempting to be a rapist? God no! Turn it off! It was unfortunately too late before it manifested the pure qualities of its genre.

Aesthetically though, Rodriguez was able to imitate that exploitation feel. The mass amount of blood spewing from the practical makeup design was exceptional and eloquently highlighted the visceral power of pragmatic effects. Limbs torn off like a family tucking into a KFC bargain bucket. Delicious. The grainy filter that imitated a film reel, “missing reel” included, had authenticity despite its occasional annoyance when infecting the entire screen with black marks everywhere.

However, strip away those aesthetic qualities, and the B-movie shine that Rodriguez aimed for suddenly dims. It’s too serious in execution to be considered full “grindhouse”, and that’s a shame.

931,tmdb17996075,"I honestly had a great enthusiasm towards this film before I watched it and I really longed for a film that would mainly offer a sinister atmosphere for the most part. I had read so many great things about ""Don't Look Now"" and the plot, the locations and the characters looked compelling enough to me to give this movie a chance and be prepared to enjoy an over and done masterpiece. Frankly, I am aware that most people who like this film, are probably going to think I'm terribly brainless because I was somehow disappointed by it, but I would much rather speaking my mind and giving my honest opinion.

The main reason why this film turned into a disappointment to me, was mostly the fact that there were quite a lot of scenes that worked as a sleeping pill to me. I think I have seen a decent share of horror films that offer big moments of silence and so-called clever symbolism and subtle details that somehow help to build a solid story. However, in ""Don't Look Now"", I felt a bit overwhelmed by the excessive amount of pointless sequences (and I'm pretty sure they ARE pointless) and images that in the end are reduced to nothing whatsoever. I felt like most of these puzzling and unsolved details, were Nicolas Roeg's way to mystify the audience with discourteous methods and filling blanks to make the movie longer and by some means more ""interesting"" to look at. Nevertheless, opposite to what those chaotic sequences were meant to incite, I felt somehow underestimated and ripped off. This film could have offered the same story and lots of bright symbolism, without the requirement of bombing the audience with tedious states of affair. I'm very supportive of ambiguity in horror films, when help to create a sinister atmosphere, at least. As an example, I'd probably mention Lucio Fulci, whose films are mostly criticized by the great quantity of nonsensical scenes. However, in Mr. Fulci's case, I think the puzzling aspect of his films, at least contribute in a great deal, to develop a terrifying atmosphere. So to make it short and clear, what I condemn the most about ""Don't Look Now"", is its offensive and underestimating ambiguity that leads to nothing at all and simply leaves the audience doubting about their own intelligence.

Too bad this film cheats the audience with so many pointless oscillations, because the story itself is not bad at all and the characters look darkly beautiful enough to make a frightening horror film, like the two old sisters, for example. The locations were probably one of the most appealing elements in ""Don't Look Now"" and probably one of the main reasons why I agreed to watch the movie until it was finished instead of just leaving it incomplete. I am not one of those horror fans who expect a big ""EUREKA!"" moment during the last minutes of a film, I can guarantee that. However, I do not appreciate feeling mocked after a movie is finished. I'm sure this comment will be voted as NOT useful several times by people who support this film and think I'm just an airhead who didn't get it, but that's all right… I can live with that ;)

931,CinemaSerf,"""John"" (Donald Sutherland) and wife ""Laura"" (Julie Christie) are living in Venice where they encounter two elderly sisters - ""Heather"" (Hilary Manson) and ""Wendy"" (Clelia Matania). The former of those enigmatic ladies claims to be able to see an apparition of their recently deceased daughter. ""Laura"" is engaged, ""John"" less so - but as the story develops we begin to appreciate that the drowned girl has left demons for both parents to deal with - some more substantial than others! Sutherland is on good form here. His character has some depth to it as we realise that he has yet to fully come to terms with his loss and his grief. Christie also delivers well as she takes a different route to dealing with her stresses and the story balances their needs of each other and for closure. As the mystery deepens, the apparitions become more real and - well what is real and what is not? Nicholas Roeg has also worked hard to create an engaging sense of menace. A lack of special and visual effects but the use of the converted chapel in which ""John"" works, works well as does a powerful score from accomplished horror genre composer Pino Donaggio all creating an enveloping sense of... yikes! Then there's the love scene - pretty risqué for the time and photographed in a much more graphic (though still stylised) fashion that does illustrate well the fact that couple are lovers still, despite their trauma. The pace can be a bit sluggish at times, but this is still a curiously stimulating film that doesn't really conform to any template that I've seen. It is a thriller as much as a horror and the characterisations are much more substantial - plenty for them and us to get our teeth into.

41402,s6kx,"**1.** In the official promotional trailer for the film, Abby appears in some scenes violently shuddering or convulsing through a computer-generated visual effect before attacking one of her victims, and also when she entered Owen's apartment without being invited in. However, this computer-generated visual effect of this trembling or convulsion has been removed from the film's scenes and cannot be found within the movie. Therefore, one star out of ten will be deducted.

**2.** Actor Richard Jenkins, who plays the character believed to be Abby's father or guardian, pours a corrosive substance on his face to conceal his identity from the police for an unclear reason. If he wanted to die rather than be imprisoned, he could have simply shot himself. If he wanted to both conceal his identity and die so that the police couldn't identify him after death, he could have detonated a hand grenade on himself instead of pouring a corrosive substance on his face, as it would erase his features without notable suffering. I don't believe he wanted to hide his identity and live disfigured for the rest of his life, as imprisonment without disfigurement compared to the torture of disfigurement by a corrosive substance would be a better option. Therefore, he had two better alternatives than suffering disfigurement by a corrosive substance until death: the first option being imprisonment without disfigurement if he was willing to have his identity revealed, or the second option of detonating a hand grenade on himself if he was unwilling to have his identity revealed. Nevertheless, he chose the worst, illogical, unrealistic option which the film failed to justify. Why to such an extent did he not want his identity discovered? If that would endanger Abby, then why didn't the film clarify that? Even if we assume the film did clarify that, the hand grenade option would still be better for concealing identity and dying together. Don't tell me he didn't want to die when he used the corrosive substance or that he didn't know it would torture him to death. He undoubtedly knew. So why die in agony when he could die without notable suffering? Nothing can explain this except that he wanted to punish himself for his sins of killing many innocent people. But since the film didn't clarify this, I cannot rely on this justification nor can it be considered valid. He should have said something before pouring the corrosive substance, such as ""Let this be atonement for my sins,"" for this justification to be valid and for me to accept it. Since that didn't happen, another star out of ten will be deducted.

**3.** When Owen sneaked out to Abby's house, he had left his home while his mother was sleeping on the couch in the living room. No scenes were filmed showing his arrival at Abby's house, her welcoming him, what they did that night, and how he ended up lying and sleeping on the floor of Abby's house despite the existence of better places to sleep. For example, he could have slept on the couch in Abby's living room, but he didn't. Why not? The reason was never clarified!

**4.** After the police officer played by actor Elias Koteas entered the bathroom where Abby was sleeping in the bathtub, Abby killed him, and in a later scene, we find that the police officer's body was hidden in a hole in the wall of an apartment frequented by a boy who used to live in the building, named Tommy. This boy appears to be Owen's friend, otherwise Owen wouldn't have known about his secret hideout where he goes to drink and smoke with his high school companions. Or perhaps Owen simply discovered this information by chance because he often loiters outside and voyeuristically watches people through his binoculars in his room. So one way or another, Owen was able to know about this place. But the problem doesn't lie here; it lies in the fact that the police officer's body was hidden in this place in an absurdly ridiculous manner. It wasn't shown who did this, but it was likely done by Abby or with Abby's participation. It's inconceivable that Abby, who is accustomed to killing, would hide the body without covering the hole with anything, whether through cement, plaster, a piece of wood, or an amount of pillow stuffing and fabric. Leaving the body exposed in this way was illogical for a character accustomed to killing because there was simply no benefit to hiding the body in this manner. They went through the trouble of hiding it without any purpose; the smell would emanate from it in a short period and spread throughout the neighborhood, and neighbors would soon smell it and bring the police. I know that Abby and Owen escaped at the end of the film, but their escape won't last as long as the body will be discovered within a few days of their escape. The body will be linked to their escape along with the recent rumors circulated by investigators, and it will be easy to find a connection between them even if it doesn't seem logical for children of their age. Their escape will create a question mark that forces investigators to discover what lies behind it. Therefore, it was mentally unacceptable for Abby, who is accustomed to killing, to bury the police officer's body in this way, which would expose her escape operation with Owen to discovery and then destroy their future together.",2025-05-28T22:25:14.822Z,6.0,Let Me In I,2010

While Cube presents an intriguing premise of individuals trapped in a deadly maze, the execution leaves much to be desired. The film attempts to blend horror with existential themes, however it's lackluster the result is more confusing than thought-provoking. The lack of clarity regarding the Cube's purpose and the characters' motivations creates a narrative void that fails to engage the audience meaningfully. Instead of offering insightful commentary, it often feels like a series of contrived scenarios designed solely for shock value and being gory.

The performances are generally subpar, with characters portrayed in exaggerated manners that detract from their believability. For instance, Quentin's descent into madness is depicted through over-the-top acting rather than nuanced character development. This makes it difficult for viewers to empathize with any of the characters, as they come across as unlikable or poorly developed archetypes rather than fully realized individuals which results in unstickable mediocre act.

The film's reliance on mathematical concepts as a means of escape is both its unique selling point and its downfall. While the idea of using advanced mathematics to navigate the Cube is intriguing, it ultimately feels forced and unrealistic. The plot hinges on the assumption that a specific character possesses unique skills necessary for survival, which raises questions about fairness and logic within the narrative. This reliance on improbable scenarios leads to significant plot holes that undermine the overall tension and coherence of the story and popping more questions than giving answers to the ones that are already there.

Perhaps most frustrating is the film's ending, which resolves the intricate buildup with a lackluster conclusion that feels like a betrayal of its earlier promise. After building tension through complex character dynamics and deadly traps, the resolution appears rushed and unsatisfying. The film ends without providing any real answers or closure, leaving viewers feeling cheated after investing their time in a convoluted journey of nothingness.

In summary, Cube offers a fascinating concept but falters in execution, character development, and narrative coherence. Its potential as a thought-provoking horror film is squandered by poor acting and an unsatisfactory conclusion, making it difficult to recommend despite its cult status (Other ones are spectacular disasters in their own right, so it's best to just steer clear of them altogether).",2024-10-23T14:53:29.625Z,,Cube,1997
431,RalphRahal,"Cube is a fascinating, low-budget sci-fi thriller that makes the most of its minimalist setup. The concept is simple but incredibly effective, a group of strangers trapped in a deadly maze of cube-shaped rooms. The movie thrives on its tension and psychological undertones, diving into how humans react under extreme pressure. It’s a smart, inventive film that doesn’t spoon-feed answers, leaving you to wrestle with its deeper themes about survival, human nature, and systems of control. While the traps and puzzles are memorable, the true focus is on the characters and how they clash as their desperation grows.

That said, the film isn’t without its flaws. The constant use of tight close-ups and high focal lengths creates an almost unbearable sense of claustrophobia, but not always in a good way. At times, the cinematography feels disorienting and can pull you out of the moment. Combined with some uneven performances and occasionally stiff dialogue, these elements might not work for everyone. Still, Cube is a must-watch if you enjoy tense, thought-provoking thrillers that make you question everything by the time the credits roll. It’s the kind of movie that sticks with you, even if it leaves you a little shaken.",2025-01-18T20:48:32.867Z,6.0,Cube,1997
10779,John Chard,"When a man's jawbone drops off it's time to reassess the situation.

Peter Jackson's The Frighteners is an odd blend of outright comedy and supernatural thriller, if able to get onside with that then there's a whole lot to enjoy. Plot essential has Michael J. Fox as a psychic who really can see dead people, so much so in fact that he has befriended three ghosts and makes a living out of setting up hauntings and charging people to exorcise the spirits. However, things turn decidedly deadly when he encounters a grim reaper like spirit that is killing people and putting a number on their foreheads. It seems there is a serial killing spirit on the loose.

Frank Bannister (Fox) is grieving from the death of his wife and he has become a conman, this is an interesting characterisation for Fox to play and he does so with relish. Initially the pic is all about the comedy, with Bannister's interactions with the three ghosts devilishly funny. Ok, the effects work now look a bit crude, but there's a vibrancy on offer both visually and orally.

Come the second third the pic shifts into a serial killer investigation and the narrative gets dark. Oh there's still fun in the mix, but Jackson and his team are toying with the very real facet of a celebrity serial killer (ebulliently played by Jake Busey). Trini Alvarado (what happened to her?) is playing what ends up as Bannister's side-kick and love interest and the pair of them are thrust into a frantic final third of a life and death battle with Busey's psychotic spirit Johnny Bartlett. Bartlett in turn is aided by mentally ill Patricia Bradley (horror icon Dee Wallace Stone), while an outrageously over the top Jeffrey Combs is in the mix as a damaged FBI agent intent on destroying bannister and all he stands for.

When you strip it down it's a live action horror comedy cartoon, which when you look in context to Jackson's early work is not surprising. It's also not surprising that The Frighteners has become a cult movie of some standing. The bonkers plot, the close to the knuckle humour and choice narrative threads make it a fascinating viewing experience. 7.5/10",2018-12-25T10:02:42.192Z,7.0,The Frighteners,1996

The movie focuses on one family’s ongoing battle: not merely against the monster but also struggling against the authorities who want to capture them, suspecting they have been infected with a virus by coming in contact with the creature.

The dialogue is pretty ordinary. I seem to recall a few unintentionally funny moments, though I cannot say for sure that it wasn’t due to the translation. I don’t intend to be hyper critical here: I sort of let the movie wash over me to get to the end, and you may or may not need to do the same.

The Thing from Another World is set at The North Pole and finds a bunch of U.S. airmen, scientists and a journalist getting more than they bargained for when they investigate a space craft frozen in the ice. 

What is most striking about the film is the basic human story of team work, the pulling together of mankind during a crisis, this theme is a big shift from the short story by John W Campbell Jr. (Who Goes There?). Where that story and later John Carpenter's wonderful remake focused on paranoia and mistrust, this film is something of the ""polar"" opposite (literally) as regards the group in peril. It bears all the hallmarks of producer Howard Hawks, who clearly influenced Nyby's direction. The script, with its pros and cons of a military and scientific society, is very much of its time, blending po-faced observations with straight backed joviality. But this all works in the film's favour and helps define it as one of the most important science fiction pictures ever made. 

Along with the other major sci-fi movie of 1951, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""TTFAW"" firmly brought the visitor from outer space idea into the public conscious. But where the former film intellectualised the alien visitor, resplendent with a message of worth, the latter is about terror, pushing forward the notion that the visitor here is a monster that wants to drink our blood and attempt World domination. No major effects work is needed here because one of the pic's highlights is only glimpsing the creature (James Arness) in little snippets, and this after we are made to wait for some time before things really kick off. This begs us to think for ourselves as regards this stalking menace, putting us firmly with this intrepid group of people, and we want to see them survive and we do care if they can or do succeed. 

The low end budget doesn't hamper the atmosphere or flow, in fact Nyby, Hawks, cinematographer Russell Harlan and music maestro Dimitri Tiomkin, work wonders to ensure there's a level of authenticity to the Arctic base and that peril is never far away. Not hindered by many of the clichés that would dominate similar themed genre pieces that followed it, film neatly taps into fears that were to become prevalent as the 1950s wore on. It may not be perfect, but a genre star it still be - so watch the sky tonight indeed. 9/10",2019-03-18T00:22:57.638Z,9.0,The Thing from Another World,1951

Scientists at a base in the frozen North discern the crash-landing of an unknown vessel 50 miles away, which they naturally investigate with the corresponding militarists. They bring a mysterious frozen specimen back to the station. Big mistake.

“The Thing From Another World” (1951) was the first attempt to film John W. Campbell’s novella Who Goes There? Being shot in 1950, there’s a quaintness to the proceedings compared to the 1982 version with Kurt Russell or the 2011 prequel.

This version lacks the grimness of those two future renditions and the extraterrestrial (played by towering James Arness) is lame by comparison. We know from “War of the Worlds” and “The Blob” that flicks from the 50s can feature effective alien creatures and be genuinely scary, but I can’t really say that about this B&W classic, although there’s of course SOME creepiness at the remote station.

On the positive side, the elaboration on a mysterious plant-based lifeform from another planet is well-done and interesting. So is the contention between Capt. Hendry (Kenneth Tobey), who is intent on saving lives, and Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), who believes scientific discovery is above all, even above all lives on Earth. Speaking of which, the idea about the possible global threat of the lifeform is later explored in the great “Species.”

I suggest watching the 2011 and 1982 movies (in that order) and, if you want more, check out this classic for an alternative take on Campbell’s novella, assuming you don’t mind old-fashioned filmmaking and B&W photography.

The movie runs 1 hour, 27 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles (including at the Ice & Cold Storage Company in order to show condensed breath in the interiors); second unit work was done at Glacier National Park, Montana.

Written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo, it was made in Spain and performed in Spanish.

The story revolves around Hector and starts at his house, which he recently moved into. He sees something in the woods behind his house and goes to investigate. He is stabbed, and while running away from the mysterious masked figure, he enters a secret lab in the neighboring field. While hiding from the masked figure, he is transported back in time one hour and makes some amazing discoveries about himself.

Never have I known a preview to give so much away, and it it is particularly heinous in this case as it is a time travel movie, with plot shifts that should be experienced in real time, so to speak. I would have been some old mad if I had watched the preview first.

But on to the movie itself. This is a Spanish language movie with subtitles, but that didn’t detract from my enjoyment of it. It is nicely set up and cleverly done. At one point I guessed right about a little plot twist I saw coming, but there was much more I didn’t predict, which brings us back to how glad I am I didn’t watch that preview. I expect this was a low budget film and there aren’t many characters in it, so don’t expect a glitzy production with awesome special effects. It just tells the story. I did feel like Hector made a couple of really stupid decisions along the way, but I cut it some slack because without them we have a boring half-hour movie!

At a glance, it looks like something with great red eyes! Then, almost immediately, he thinks he sees a naked woman. This has to be investigated so off he goes, only to arrive and discover a body and to be stabbed by a mysterious man whose face is covered in blood-stained bandages. Who is this character? Well the scissor-wielding felon quickly heads to a remote lab in the woods where we meet “El Joven” (Nacho Vigalondo) who seems to have managed to concoct some sort of time-travelling machine and there is more than one “Hector” now doing the rounds! The young scientist is at his wits end as to what to do whilst the latest iteration of “Hector” has decided he wants to dispose of the others and use the young girl whose body started the whole thing in the first place (Bárbara Goenaga) as a lure. It’s one of those lightly comedic dramas, this, that reminded me of a “Doctor Who” series from the 1980s coupled with some quirky characters and a little naughty voyeurism! Elejalde holds it together quite entertainingly even if there are quite a few plot holes liberally sprinkled throughout - just how this all got started in the first place, for example - and it’s still quite a good fun watch that could almost be be set as a silent film to maximise the daftness of the repetitive but never quite identical scenarios as they play out. Indeed, it’s quite possible that each version of “Hector” suffers from some sort of brain-drain each time, as he definitely gets more and more dopey. It packs quite a bit into ninety minutes given it can’t have had much of a budget, so if you like your sci-fi devoid of flashy visuals and whizzy audio then you might just enjoy this.

16938,Wuchak,"***Historical slasher with John Saxon, Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder*** 

It’s the Christmas season at a sorority house in the Northeast wherein an ambiguous psycho hiding in the attic makes crank calls to the girls and slays them one-by-one. John Saxon plays the local detective.

“Black Christmas” (1974) obviously influenced “Halloween” (1978), e.g. the closet scene, but was influenced itself by psycho slasher flicks like “Psycho” (1960), “Dementia 13” (1963) and “Silent Night, Bloody Night” (1972).

Honestly, the 2006 remake has a more absorbing story which, to me, is the best indicator of a quality movie. This version is dull by comparison, particularly the first half, but it picks up steam in the second. And the open-ended climax is interesting. 

But I strongly prefer the female cast in the remake; they're just all-around superior IMHO. Of course Olivia Hussey is attractive in this rendition, albeit cold, and Lynne Griffin as Clare is winsome, although her part is small. Andrea Martin (Phyl) comes across as a shorter version of Cher with short, curly hair. Unfortunately, Margot Kidder as Barb is one of the most obnoxious characters in cinema, a real turn-off (so is Mrs. Mac, but less so). Thankfully, Barb's only prominent through the first half.

The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in Toronto.

Each character has a purpose. By that, I don't mean simply to drive the plot along. Each character is a person, and they each have their own unique personalities and motivations. Barb isn't just the drunk and morally abrasive stereotype; she's driven by her jealousy and likely by issues from her childhood. Each character feels about as deep as her, at the least. 

The only character who isn't fully explained is Billy, and that's for the best. Billy isn't a character we want explained, and it only drives the horror deeper that he isn't.

16938,The Movie Diorama,"Black Christmas decorates traditional festivities with blood, suffocation and disturbing phone calls. Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! And have a slashin’ good time! The slasher sub-genre was most proficient during the mid-to-late 70s, with ‘Texas Chainsaw Massacre’, ‘Halloween’ and a plethora of spicy Argento features to add a worldly aesthetic. However, one film that innovated the tropes and traits commonly found in the aforementioned titles, was Bob Clark’s Black Christmas. A horror “slasher” (if you can classify it as that...) where an anonymous serial killer remains secluded in a sorority house, gradually picking off the girls one by one. Just in time for Santa to come down that warmly lit chimney and deliver them coffins wrapped up in cute little bows.

To say that Black Christmas was revolutionary and a blooded sprout for the blossoming sub-genre to come, would be an understatement. A nameless unknown killer that exhumes mental instability? Check. An expendable cast of characters that stupidly investigate ominous sounds by themselves? Check. Excruciating tension with every camera movement? Absolutely! Surprisingly, now that I’ve witnessed various films during the conception of a horror movement, it’s incredibly easy to see how influential Black Christmas is. Not for its innovative concept, as other simpler thrillers utilise slashing techniques with efficiency (‘Psycho’), but rather for its technical proficiency.

Clark’s direction, whilst unpolished, is solid throughout. Taut camera pans to explore the darkened hallways of the sorority house. Minimal sound editing to heighten the suspense. Excellent use of shadows to illustrate the antagonist’s anonymity. Sublime POV perspective to place the viewer in the shoes of the killer. And a ramped up conclusive act that will have anyone watching perched on the edge of their seats eagerly anticipating to unwrap the plot twist, even if that narrative turn was predictable from the offset. The camera can be visible on specific occasions, mostly through reflections in picture frames as it glides through hallways. Emphasising that unrefined quality of Clark’s novice-like direction. It does give the feature some flavour, perhaps not the jolly festivities one was yearning for. More egg nog than champagne.

Yet what really injected some holiday spirit into the story, were the characters. Uniquely all acquiring a distinguishable personality that made them different and relatable. The shady drunk friend or the intellectual gal who has all the common sense (that is until she goes wandering by herself...!). The point is, they were all memorable, and that’s a rare achievement in slashers. The second act, where the campus police become involved, does stagnate the overall pace with minimal storytelling momentum. Fortunately the third act immediately picks it back up for an explosive bauble of...slashing.

So despite the lack of actual slashing, overall unrefined quality and inconsistent pacing, it’s an extremely enjoyable horror flick that takes a gentle holiday season and turns it into a crazy murder-sesh. Perhaps my new annual Christmas film? We’ll see...! I am sadistic after all!",2020-01-16T13:48:26.778Z,7.0,Black Christmas,1974
16938,CinemaSerf,"I suppose a sorority can be used to host a multitude of characters, so that's what Bob Clark does here as he puts four quite different girls into an house supervised by the likably dypso ""Mrs. Mac"" (Marian Waldman).

Some get upset by his behaviour, others laugh it off but when one of their number ""Clare"" (Lynne Griffin) disappears and the police are called in by her boyfriend ""Chris"" (Art Hindle), the sense of menace ratchets up a notch.

More menacing yet is the increasingly detailed knowledge contained in the calls. ""Billy"" is spookily well informed. Could he be one of them? I'm not too sure what this has to have to do with Christmas, to be honest. It's just another typical slasher set amongst a student fraternity that gives everyone an opportunity to scream and make some shockingly poor under-pressure decisions. Neither the acting nor the writing stand out but the photography is quite effective at creating and sustaining a modest sense of peril as our killer nears goal.

949423,Nathan,"_Pearl_ is a great character study that dives deeper in the stakes that an individual will go to attain success. It is unquestionable that the main question people will ask is, does it live up to X? While I do think it is a good film that I thoroughly enjoyed, it does not overtake its predecessor and that is completely okay. They are two entirely different movies but achieve their goals brilliantly.

This film is the textbook definition of a slow burn. The movie drags on and continues to provide this eerie tension as the viewer knows what the end result of this tragic film will be, but still remains locked in to see how it will unfold. I really enjoyed the first act, the character introductions were fantastic, and the audience has an instant connection with Pearl. But the second act drags a little more than I would have liked, but by the minute it is getting stale the third comes to pick up the pace and deliver a satisfying conclusion.

Mia Goth is utterly fantastic in this film. There is a solid six-minute monologue of just her acting her ass off. One take, one angle, and somehow, she was able to lock me in completely. She has burst on to the scene with X and Pearl, and I cannot wait to see where her career goes from here.

Overall, this film is great, but expectations should be had going into it. It is not going to be an action-packed slasher like its predecessor, but those elements are sprinkled in and work well with the overall film. If you enjoyed X, you should definitely watch this.

""Pearl may be a prequel to X, but Ti West turns this slasher into an incredibly complex character study represented - and co-written (!) - by Mia Goth.

The new star of the horror genre deepens the protagonist Pearl, exploring her tremendous desire to fulfill her dream of wanting to become something more than a mere farm girl, including a mesmerizing monologue of nearly ten uninterrupted minutes, where raw, insane, wholly genuine emotion of the character comes across in a fascinating manner. Extra appreciation for the practical effects and the fact that basically the entire movie is shot during broad daylight.

Gore sequences become somewhat repetitive, and the narrative doesn't escape its predictability, being an overall less captivating film than its predecessor.""

She lives on a farm whilst her young husband is off fighting on the Somme. She shares her life with her Germanic, rather authoritarian, mother ""Ruth"" (Tandi Wright) and her profoundly disabled father who cannot speak and who is entirely dependent on these two women. ""Pearl"" longs to escape. On one of her occasional visits to town to collect her father's laudanum, she encounters the local projectionist (David Corenswet) who shows her a (quite racy) film and suggests that maybe a new life could be her's. Meantime, her life at the farm is becoming unbearable and her options for escape lead her to realise that drastic action may be needed - a plan that is accidentally put into play after an altercation with her mother. It's perfectly watchable, this, but it's also perfectly forgettable. The story is weak and thin, and though the photography is attractive, the whole thing just doesn't catch fire for me. There's no menace. It's not an horror film - it's a film about a mentally ill girl that offers us a few mildly entertaining scenarios that peter out as quickly as the plot does before an ending that screams sequel loudly and defiantly. It certainly does not need to be seen on a cinema screen.",2023-03-23T15:33:58.944Z,6.0,Pearl,2022
949423,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

The strange and unusual “Pearl,” a prequel to writer / director Ti West‘s “X”, is a different kind of slasher film. Creating an origin story for the title villain, the film tells the history of a farm girl dreamer with a serious mean streak. It’s a horror movie that’s unlike any other, a candy-colored, nightmarish dream world of lofty ambitions, brutal violence, and bloody murder.

Pearl (Mia Goth) is trapped on her family’s isolated farm. She dutifully performs her barn chores and tends to her ailing, wheelchair-bound father (Matthew Sunderland), all under the stern eye of her overbearing mother (Tandi Wright). Pearl wants nothing more in the world than to live the glamorous life of “the girls in the pictures” that she sees on the big screen at the movies. With her husband Howard off to fight World War I, Pearl finds her ambitions at odds with the reality of the life she’s been dealt. It’s clear something isn’t right with the young woman, and her violent tendencies begin to bubble to the surface.

Things weren’t great for women in 1918, and the world certainly wasn’t a place for a fiery feminist. The film is an intriguing character study of a thoroughly disturbed woman who is a victim of her own gender. Goth is asked to do the film’s heavy lifting, and she gives a wonderfully unhinged lead performance. She screams a lot but displays an impressive range, especially as she is thrust into episodes of psychopathic ire. Her calm demeanor is frightening, and almost as disturbing as her precise, unique kills. Using farm tools, Pearl becomes a skilled murderer as she gives herself over to her homicidal desires.

The story is simple but engaging, and West creates an old-timey mood with a vintage score that fits the tone beautifully. The Technicolor aesthetic harkens back to Hollywood’s Golden Age, a time of traditional glitz and glamour. It’s a great looking film that feels fresh and different, and West directs with an assured eye. His long, unbroken takes are showy but executed with purpose, and the film features a powerful monologue that’s unforgettable.

One of my favorite parts about the movie is the chilling ending, an extended scene of a true demented breakdown that still haunts me. There’s so much that makes this film so memorable, and “Pearl” is a special kind of horror film with a refreshing style and killer instinct.",2023-04-23T06:25:34.989Z,7.0,Pearl,2022
949423,tmdb51616167,"I will be doing a combined review for the two films, ""X"" and ""Pearl.""

Upon seeing the high ratings given by both the general public and critics to these movies, I am left puzzled about what truly makes a good film.

Let's start with ""X,"" a movie that I found to be absolutely terrible. The film revolves around pornography rather than a cohesive storyline, resulting in a disjointed and atrocious viewing experience. The cinematography, acting, storytelling, and writing were all subpar, yet critics inexplicably praised it.

The attempt to elevate the film with Jenna Ortega fell short, as she had minimal screen time amidst excessive male and adult nudity, making it unsuitable for general viewing. This is a movie best watched in private, not recommended by me at all.

Moving on to ""Pearl,"" I was equally disappointed as it also relied heavily on sexual themes. The film took a bizarre turn, culminating in a scene that made me walk out of the theater in disbelief.

It's baffling to see these films receive acclaim, especially when performances like Mia Goth's are lacking. It seems that the current focus is on titillation rather than genuine storytelling.

As we await the verdict on the third film, it appears that the world may be more interested in gratification than meaningful narratives.",2024-09-02T18:58:58.979Z,1.0,Pearl,2022
949423,RalphRahal,"Pearl (2022) is a visually striking psychological horror film that takes a unique approach to storytelling. Set in the 1920s, the movie immediately stands out with its vibrant, almost dreamlike cinematography that contrasts with its dark themes. The production design is meticulous, capturing the era’s aesthetic with rich colors and a polished, old-Hollywood feel. While the plot starts off slow, especially in the first act and early second, it gradually picks up, pulling you deeper into the protagonist's unsettling world. Ti West's direction is methodical, letting tension simmer rather than relying on cheap scares, which works well for the film's psychological depth.

Mia Goth carries the entire movie with an outstanding performance, making Pearl one of the most compelling horror characters in recent years. Her ability to shift between innocence and madness is captivating, and she brings an emotional weight that elevates the script. The dialogue feels natural yet eerie, adding to the film’s unease. The score is another highlight, blending classic orchestral sounds with unsettling undertones that perfectly match the film’s descent into darkness. While it may not be as fast-paced as some horror films, Pearl delivers a slow-burn psychological experience that lingers long after the credits roll.",2025-02-16T21:36:06.705Z,7.0,Pearl,2022

It did lose steam for me the longer it went on and there aren't many moments to remember, tbh I personally would've preferred more of older Pearl than younger Pearl.

Still, Mia Goth continues to impress. Tandi Wright stands out too, even if it certainly is Goth's movie. David Corenswet is there too, I wonder what that guy is up to nowadays. The film, like its predecessor, remains a treat visually, the distinctive eras of each flick are definite plus points.

913290,Nathan,"_Barbarian_ is such a twisted and incredibly unique film. Going into this film, I thought I had a pretty good indication of how this was going to go down and was ready for a fun cheesy horror film that follow a pretty generic pattern, but boy was I wrong. Almost the entirety of the trailer was just the first act, and it left me seriously stumped at where this movie was going.
That sense of unknown really added to the thick tension that this movie brought throughout. There is a paranoia that occurs with both the audience and the main character. You never know who to trust, even if they give you all the indications that they are trustworthy.

In today's horror cinema, it is rare to see a movie so reliant on building tension rather than just jump scares galore. Not to say that this film does not have any jump scares, but they are there to enhance and bring a crescendo to the long scenes of tension and dread.

Overall, the acting was brilliant. Georgina Campbell was fantastic. Bill Skarsgård was a bit awkward at times, but I do think that was by choice, as his actor was a kind awkward sweetheart. Justin Long stole the show. His character added a bit of lightness and someone who the audience can really root against.

Without giving too much away, Barbarian feels a little like The Hills Have Eyes, meets Psycho, meets Quasimodo. The problem here is the scripting and handling. Its takes far too long for this story to get off the ground, it has weird, nonsensical plot holes and the reveal comes far to early. 

Whats left almost feels like a second film. It leaves only a reiteration of the essential earlier plot line with a few wrinkles, as the film moves towards its rather icky, conclusion.

Of course, any sense of fear and tension, built up subtly in the first part of the film, is dissipated too. You know what's coming.

In summary, this film feels like it borrows from other horror flicks, in the worst possible way, leading to a disjointed but predictable viewing experience that's neither all that scary or even terribly interesting. The only thing propping it up, is the acting, which is of a high standard. Yet, as I've said more times than I can count, that on its own, is not enough.",2022-10-26T00:26:56.139Z,4.0,Barbarian,2022

To be fair to auteur Zach Cregger, there is quite an impactful degree of claustrophobic horror to this but I am afraid I wasn't convinced - right from the start - with the plausibility of the whole thing. Whom, in their right mind, would discover what she does and then go off exploring, on their own, without taking some fairly elementary precautions?

Anyway, it turns out that ""AJ"" (Justin Long) owns the house and when he turns up to find it still bestrewn with their luggage, he joins in the hunt in the tunnels and the pace hots up a little as escape becomes the imperative against a foe who makes ""Gollum"" look like Claudia Schiffer.

""Last Night in Soho is incredibly captivating throughout the entire runtime, but Edgar Wright's all-in in the insane third act is definitely going to generate a divisive response.

Story-wise, the compelling protagonists - brilliantly interpreted by Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy - follow intriguing arcs holding unexpected revelations that ultimately make sense with the overall narrative. Stunning cinematography and production design come together to create a visually jaw-dropping 1960s London, which becomes an even more entertaining place to visit due to Steve Price's addictive music.

However, the last act feels a sudden hurry to tie every knot through overwhelming editing, hasty pacing, and careless transitions, which work against what the film had been until that point.

576845,Nathan,"I found that Last Night in Soho took its sweet time getting me hooked, but as the first act was coming to a close, I was locked in. The movie constantly had me thinking what was to come next, trying to decipher what was the connection between the main characters were and why this was happening. There were scenes in this film that really had me on the edge of my seat, and I have not had that experience in a long time. I did not know much coming into the film, so I expected Anya Taylor-Joy to be the lead, but I was pleasantly surprised at the power performance that Thomasin McKenzie delivered. She really displayed the full range of emotion, showing shades of a shy timid and unsure girl to being a powerful and confident mistress of the night. But not only did these dueling personalities take center stage, but her ability to capture the horror and terror her visions continued to bring on. It was an amazing and I will definitely be tuning in to more of her films. I found the plot to be very good, on the surface it is somewhat simplistic, but it is delivered very well with each piece of the puzzle slowly being hand delivered by Edgar Wright. But by the third act, the twists are predictable, and the ending does not deliver as much as I would have liked.

Last Night in Soho promised a completely original fresh new horror film from the brilliant mind of Edgar Wright. The trailers were unnerving, tense, and scary, but unfortunately, that was where the horror stayed. The sequences set in the past were interesting and well done but as the murder mystery began to unfurl, so did the movie.

I don't love (but still like) the ending as much as the rest of it, though <em>'Last Night in Soho'</em> is an extremely enjoyable psychological horror flick. The film's aesthetic is top notch, while the performances of Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy are brilliant; the way their story is portrayed is real nice. Diana Rigg, Matt Smith and Terence Stamp are involved too.

I do have a few lesser things to mention. The fashion college classmates being hella cartoony is one, though the only main one is the end reveal... it kinda underwhelmed me, even if there's nothing inherently wrong with it. As it happened I was just like  ""well, OK..."". I think I expected greater based on what precedes. It's a 'good' conclusion, still.

All in all, it just falls short of being something I'd consider as 'great' but I still had a positive time with it and would happily revisit it.

576845,tensharpe,"Edgar Wright takes the audience on a journey back and forth from present day to the swinging sixties in this wonderful psychological thriller. Due to Eloise’s ( Thomasin McKenzie )  upbringing by her grandmother ( Rita Tushingham ) she is obsessed with the 1960’s fashion and music. After being accepted onto a fashion course at a leading London college, Eloise moves into student accommodation and shares a room with another girl on the same course. Unfortunately the two girls are polar opposites and Eloise quickly relocates to a bedsit on Goodge Street in the heart of London. The landlady Miss Collins ( Diana Rigg ) welcomes her to the property with the house rules that include no male visitors. From this position in the heart of London Eloise manages to secure a part time job and has easy access to vintage dress shops and local landmarks. 

However from early on we are shown that Eloise has a form of psychic gift or illness that allows her to see and communicate with her dead mother. This affliction becomes even more stronger once Eloise has settled into the bedsit. After she retires to bed Eloise is almost immediately transported back in time to sixties London and becomes a character called Alex who changes her name to Sandy. Sandy ( Anna Taylor-Joy ) has also just arrived in London looking for fame. A talented singer, blonde,  beautiful and full of confidence, Sandy transports Eloise to the nightclub scene of Swinging London where she encounters sixties star Cilla Black performing in front of an audience. Jack ( Matt Smith ) a handsome, playboy talent manager spots Sandy and the two quickly form a relationship. However as the evening draws to a close and Sandy and Jack passionately embrace, Eloise is abruptly awoken by her alarm and is back in her own bed. Initially what was perceived as just a dream becomes more unnerving when it is pointed out to Eloise at college that she has a love bite on her neck. Each evening Eloise is transported back in time as both observer of Sandy and Sandy herself. As Eloise becomes more obsessed with sixties London  and the fun loving Sandy, Eloise in the present day, begins to change her look and style to copy that of Sandy. The toxic relationship of Sandy and Jack intensifies as Eloise discovers Jack wasn't a talent agent but only looking to recruit another girl into prostitution. As the seedier and more dark side of Soho London in the 1960’s begins to emerge, Eloise finds herself embroiled in a nightmare that threatens both her sanity and life.

Anna Taylor-Joy is outstanding especially during the audition and earlier nightclub scenes. The soundtrack is littered with 1960’s classic hits and as Eloise’s mental state deteriorates and her actions become more erratic the music perfectly reflects action on screen. There is a very satisfying conclusion that allows the late Diana Rigg to shine and she gives a strong and extremely memorable performance as the sinister landlady.

In conclusion “Last Night In Soho” is a very satisfying and enjoyable horror, thriller that until the final chapter has the audience guessing what is real and was is not and who is the actual antagonist.",2023-03-16T21:30:13.857Z,8.0,Last Night in Soho,2021

Netflix has been supporting small, independent filmmaking for a while now. In 2018, Roma (re)opened a Best Picture nomination path to foreign films. Last year, Martin Scorsese's epic The Irishman could only come to life via streaming since no major studio wanted a three-and-a-half-hour runtime for a theater release. Between these two, dozens of other indie flicks got Netflix's (or other streaming networks) support. 2020 brings us a Spanish horror-thriller from a first-time director (Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia): The Platform (or El Hoyo).

Since its showing at TIFF, this movie has been receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback. So, obviously, I needed to add it to my list. I watched it a couple of days ago, and I wanted to take time to think about it because it's definitely going to become a divisive film, especially among general audiences. The Platform carries an extremely abstract narrative, filled with symbolism, metaphors, analogies, and allegories to our political-social-economic situation. It's not a straightforward thriller at all.

It's a tremendously intriguing concept, developed through captivating storytelling and a very dark tone. It's a prison that resembles our society of today. Filled with hypocrisy and selfishness. One month, you're the king of the world on a level where food comes in excess, but you still want it all for yourself, ignoring desperate requests from down below. As soon as in the next day, you're a miserable human being, fighting for scraps with your ""cellmate"", and on the exact same position those desperate people were before... And now you want their help?!

That last narrative analogy to the real world is undoubtedly my favorite. I was never a fan of politics (who is?), so analogies and symbolism regarding that part of our life don't really impact me. However, it's clear that the screenwriters put a lot of effort into making such a meaningful story. If the ambiguousness is removed from the screenplay, there's still plenty to enjoy. Goreng's arc goes from just trying to get a diploma to actually save the people from lower levels. His story takes the viewer through tons of violence, blood, gore, and genuinely disgusting sequences.

Therefore, people who want straight-up popcorn-action instead of a more philosophical take as the filmmakers intended, there's a lot to be entertained by. The Platform is also another proof that you don't need a massive budget to build an immersive atmosphere. The set and production design are as simple as they could be, but it's especially due to that simplicity that the claustrophobic prison works so well. For a directorial debut, Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia does an excellent job of controlling the pacing and applying the right shots to each situation.

Unfortunately, my main issue is the same as most people: the ending. I will restrain myself from giving away any minor spoilers, so I'll just write that it doesn't work at all levels, at least not for me. As expected, it's as ambiguous as the rest of the movie. As soon as I finished the film, I was frustrated by so many unanswered (logical) questions, and after a couple of days of thinking about it, these questions still exist. You'll never find an answer to everything, but that was never the main goal. There has to be a balance between reality and fiction. Between what's real and what's just a metaphoric symbol. No one can justify *everything* with ""oh, it's just a representation of something else"".

For me, there are two ways of interpreting the ending: I could either take everything literally, which would raise tons of questions without an answer, or I could try and solely look at the story through Goreng's perspective. I do believe the latter approach is the best one, even if it still carries other issues regarding secondary characters. It doesn't answer everything, but it's the perspective I find to make more sense with the movie. It makes the screenplay more cohesive and congruent.

Nevertheless, the problem I can't seem to avoid is the abrupt break in tone. For such a brutal, raw, bloody display of human behavior in a situation of survival (the way colors are used is very clever), the climax feels detached from everything that comes before. The underlying themes are there from the get-go, but these are precisely what they are: secondary messages lying under a pretty real story. Going from horrible murders, sacrifices, and God knows what else, to such a philosophical, soulful ending in the way the film does... it's far from a seamless transition.

Basically, if you go in expecting definite answers about whatever this prison is, who controls it, and how it truly works, you'll probably leave disappointed and frustrated. It's one of those movies that heavily relies on how people perceive its ending and how much impact does it cause on an overall opinion. Looking at the conclusion solely from Goreng's perspective works the best for me, even if some unanswered (logical) questions still exist. The abrupt break in tone transitioning to the film's climax is my main problem, but The Platform has plenty of positives. An extremely intriguing premise is developed through remarkably captivating storytelling, and an exceptional cast elevates the well-written screenplay. First-time director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia and his team do an excellent job. Set and production design prove how a small budget can still create an immersive, claustrophobic atmosphere. Even if the ending only works partially, the symbolism and allegories of our world's politics and social-economic situation are a brilliant, thought-provoking piece of a screenplay. I like more it the more I think about it.

619264,Kamurai,"A fantastic watch, will watch again, and can recommend.

This is a survivalist movie, heavy with philosophy of morality.  A lot of the time when I get to say anything close to that, I get to say, ""but there is humor too"", there is not: not traditional humor anyways.

This is a dark movie filled with metaphor and cruel reality.  Now while I am usually offended by reality encroaching on my escapism, that is normally when I'm trying to watch dirt humor.  When to take a concept like this, the relation to reality only strengthens the movie.

""Those above, and those below"" is something to think about, and if that intrigues you or you're already onboard for a philosophical discussion of anti-hierarchical class society structure, or intrigue by the idea that it doesn't matter who or when someone is in the class structure: it defeats the society just by being.

The production value is minimal but sufficient, and I think that is by design.  It does live in the land of bad dubs, but not enough for me to fault it.

This is what happens when we build a house for a door (instead of building a house and then put doors in it); An exotic, dirty and cluttered movie. Dirty but not necessarily in the visual meaning but in the cinematic meant. The director does not know what he wants to do at all, the camera angles, the frames, the compositions and everything are completely in the air, he just knows he wants to beat capitalism but he does not know how and for this purpose, which is what He does not do well, he comes to the great art of cinema and insults it with this film. A film must first become a cinematic work and then speak, first a house must be built and then several doors must be left for it, it is not possible to throw an ideology in the middle and make a film around it, of course, if it is possible to call this film, a film! Symbolism and the use of symbols are correct when the director does not shout with every dialogue and every scene that this object is a symbol! The symbol should not be completely revealed to be a symbol. If he is going to make a symbolic film, he must first know how, then put signs in his symbols, not to turn the whole film into a bunch of ridiculous symbols. From one place, the director does not even remember what his goal was and enters another phase, which he thinks is a revolution. Not only he does not understand and show the revolution, but he forces his two main characters, who are not characters at all, to beat everyone so that they can only get food to the final stage! you are kidding! How do these movements represent revolution, leftism, and helping others? They go downstairs and beat everyone, and finally they feed their ridiculous symbol (the dessert) to the child and send him down to, for example, when she returns to the top floor, the tyrants become surprised! So what? what will happen! Did the film become a leftist film? Did it promote revolution and resistance? Did it help everyone and save them? Never. In general, it can be said that ""Platform"" is a disgusting, ridiculous and shameless film that insults both the cinema and its audience, and there is no cinematic or ideal value in it, and in the humblest case, even a slogan.",2020-12-26T16:53:11.843Z,,The Platform,2019

As characters grapple with their desperate circumstances, a hero attempts to find hope by devising a plan to send a message to their captors and possibly save lives.

619264,RalphRahal,"""The Platform"" is one of those movies that sticks with you long after the credits roll. It's not your typical horror flick, though it definitely has some gruesome moments. This isn't about jump scares, it's about a terrifying concept that's surprisingly relevant to our world.

The directing is brilliant. They keep the tension high throughout, and the way they use the limited space of ""the pit"" is incredibly claustrophobic. The cinematography is equally impressive, with some truly unsettling visuals. The acting is solid across the board, with each character adding a unique layer to the story.

The script is sharp and thought-provoking. It doesn't spoon-feed you the message, forcing you to grapple with the ethical dilemmas at the heart of this dystopian society.

619264,Alunauwie,"The Platform (2019) explores wealth inequality through a brutal vertical prison system, symbolizing human greed and survival instincts. Director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia uses minimal sets enhanced by visual effects to create a dystopian environment that reflects social critique. Cannibalism and violence serve as metaphors for selfishness in a harsh hierarchical society.

The story centers on Goreng’s transformation from indifference to moral awareness, driving the emotional core amid external and internal conflicts. The prison’s vague origin adds to the unsettling atmosphere, while tension escalates through psychological struggles and inmate interactions. The narrative is tightly paced with layered symbolism at every level and encounter.

The film ends with a strong twist that underscores themes of solidarity and change, supported by intense performances and immersive visuals. Cinematography, sound design, and color composition reinforce the disturbing yet meaningful tone. Though some mysteries remain unresolved, the film stands as a gripping psychological thriller with a sharp social message—and for Indonesian viewers, Goreng’s name adds an amusing extra layer.

7191,CinemaSerf,"I suppose the first thing to warn of is - it is shot entirely POV, and for many (including me) that can prove to be really quite annoying at times (and particularly difficult to light effectively). The premiss is that ""Jason"" (Mike Vogel) and girlfriend ""Lily"" (Jessica Lucas) are living the happy lives of a young couple. When one night they set off to attend a leaving do for their pal ""Rob"" (Michael Stahl-David) their party is shattered by what seems like an earthquake, followed by a desperate hunt for his girlfriend ""Beth"" (Odette Annable) as something ginormous is stalking the streets of New York. The camera passes from person to person, so that does give us a different perspective of the ensuing mania - but actually I didn't find them a particularly engaging bunch of panic-stricken folks so I can't say I was very concerned for their safety. Some of the decisions they make - admittedly under a fair degree of duress - seem staggeringly risky and/or stupid; the sound editing overdoes the screeching and wailing to such an extent that the dialogue can be barely audible at times, and though well paced eventually, it still takes just a bit too long to actually get going. It is certainly an interesting concept, and if the style of cinematography doesn't drive you mad after twenty minutes, then I reckon you will quite enjoy the intimacy of the thing - at times, it is actually quite scary.",2024-05-20T10:30:44.702Z,6.0,Cloverfield,2008

22970,LastCaress1972,"Finally got around to The Cabin in the Woods. 8/10, great fun. A Joss Whedon-(co)written (also co-written and directed by Drew Goddard, who wrote Cloverfield) take on an old horror staple in which 5 stereotypical teenagers (an academic, a jock, a stoner, a slut and a ""nice"" girl) venture out into the woods for a dirty weekend. It's no spoiler to say that these unfortunate young naïfs appear to have been cherry-picked and are being heavily monitored all the way into the woods by some very (very) high-tech manner of... what? Government agency? It's with these fellows that we visit first, before we ever meet our protagonists; two middle-aged, white collar I.T. types, a little brow-beaten by what appears to be a fairly monotonous job (although it really ****ing isn't) but full of typical office cameraderie and essentially confident in their own competence and that of the numerous other departments that make up this rather large-scale operation. Whoever is watching our heroes/heroines, they're big-time. So, what's happening? To say more would be to start giving things away, but those kids are very deliberate archetypes, placed in a very deliberately typical horror scenario. Because it's an American film set in America, it's called The Cabin in the Woods as is befitting the conventions of God-knows-how-many American horror flicks. Were it a J-Horror set in Tokyo, it would be called The Freaky Long-Haired Schoolgirl Ghost, an assertion ably illustrated in the film itself to great and rather humourous effect.

Decent performances all-round, even the deliberately irritating characters are kind-of likeable. A pre-Thor Chris Hemsworth is particularly good as is Richard Jenkins (Nathaniel ""The Dead Patriarch"" Fisher from Six Feet Under). It threw me a bit, this film, because in purposely not looking too deeply at what it was about prior to seeing it, I mistakenly thought I was about to watch a seriously scary and effective horror, and this isn't the case at all. It's a slick product with what looks like a decent budget as you'd expect from a Joss Whedon project (in case you've been under a rock somewhere, he of Buffy/Angel and latterly of The Avengers fame) and it's loaded with nods to other horror literary and cinematic classics (The Evil Dead, Hellraiser, The Strangers and HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos are all fairly explicitly referenced), but it's not especially gory, it's intentionally funny more often than it's intentionally scary and it's a real thrill-ride, a slice of fun. It's not quite there, but it's a damn site closer to ""Horror-Comedy"" than it is to balls-out ""Horror"". It's not perfect by a long way - it instills bags of concerned curiosity in the viewer, but provokes almost zero real tension whatsoever. And late-on a special effects extravaganza treads clumsily into Night at the Museum-for-grown-ups territory. But it remains a great way to spend a couple of hours.",2013-08-11T15:53:56.959Z,,The Cabin in the Woods,2011
22970,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is another one of those movies where I cannot understand why so many people give it so high scores. Sure it’s not a really bad movie but, personally, I found it only moderately good. I’m not sure whether the movie was intended to be scary or funny or both. It wasn’t very funny though and only moderately scary.

It has been presented as a not-your-usual-teenage-slasher-horror movie. Well, it sure has an interesting twist but…it is still a teenage slasher horror movie. The twist could really have lifted the movie but unfortunately this good idea is pretty much wasted in a poor implementation.

Instead of holding on to the surprise it’s spoiled right away with that eagle flying in to the force field (since when did we learn to build force fields by the way?). Another thing that really drags down the film are these utter morons in the control room. If this was really a matter of survival of mankind then you would have thought that it would have been left to professional people and not these jerks.

The movie isn’t all bad though. With the exception of these major flaws it does pass as a decent slasher/horror movie and makes for a reasonably entertaining hour and a half of not too intelligent movie watching. The part nearing the end where all the monsters goes on a rampage is rather fun to watch. I was not very impressed by the end itself though.

22970,Gimly,"**The following is a long-form review that I originally wrote in 2012.**

Jesus Christ. What just happened to my brain?

I was worried that _Cabin in the Woods_ was gonna be a letdown, ‘cause I had built it up so much in my head, and it seemed such a ridiculous concept that it would have been nearly impossible to pull off flawlessly. And maybe it won’t go to join the ranks of my favourite films in existence, but it was… So. Fucking. Good.

Drew Goddard (who wrote _Cloverfield_) is no stranger to working with Joss Whedon (_Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Avengers_) and my God do they ever make a team. Joss Whedon is my unopposed all-time favourite person involved in the film industry in any way, shape, or form. Which is quite the claim, given my interests. He’s had a couple of fuck ups, and been fucked around a few times too, but all in all, nobody captures me quite the way he does.

I’ll try and aim for not-spoilers, if you watch the trailer you’ll get that this isn’t a typical horror movie. You’ll also pick up on that if you watch the first 5 minutes of the damn thing. I won’t go into the finer details, but let me just reiterate, it is NOT a slasher film. There’s a fair amount of horror, some action, some sci-fi, a bit of fantasy, some short but sweet comedy, a bunch of thriller, a little monster-movie, a bit of homage and a healthy (but not overdone) dose of parody. Joss Whedon tends to do that, his work is usually less in the horror genre and more in the… Genre genre. If that makes sense.

I seem to recall it performing kind of averagely at the box office, but critical reception was fantastic. And rightfully so. And fan-aimed movies as good as this always manage to fall into their cult, so there’s a pretty avid group of people who are super keen on it, too. Again, rightly so. I think the best (as well as most important) thing about _Cabin in the Woods_, is that it pumps some new blood into horror. Sure, it wasn’t 100% original, but then it never claimed to be. At least it wasn’t a sequel or another bloody remake.

Seriously, I hate on remakes much, much less than most, but come on people! This is all rather ridiculous. Imagine if the Wachowskis had said “Hey, we’ve got this great idea for a dystopian, industrial sci-fi type thing called _The Matrix_… Actually, you know what? That sounds like an awful lot of effort. Let’s do an over the top American remake of _The Castle_ instead!” Yeah, sounds like a great world to live in. Fuckin’… Lazy ‘n shit…

Lost track there, anyway! _Cabin in the Woods_! Fuck! Good! Watch that shit! Make up your own mind of course, but I really dig it. There’s something to be said for being fucked up and going with it. I’m sure some people will dismiss _Cabin_ entirely, because it’s so out there. And I’m sure even more people will get pissy about the ending. But if you have no expectations, and just try enjoy the ride, then I think you damn well might.

Martyrs is written and directed by Pascal Laugier. It stars Morjana Alaoui and Mylene Jampanoi.

The New French Extremity Movement had its bar raised considerably by Pascal Laugier’s brutal but thought provoking horror. It’s a film as uncompromising as it is confrontational, a picture guaranteed to get a response for better or worse. Once viewed it simply will not be forgotten, the images, the twisty narrative thematics and the bloodshed that flows consistently throughout the story, Laugier and his two brilliant lead actresses assault the senses, magnificently so.

Story is unfurled as a three tiered structure, each one devastating, but it’s with the final third where the picture goes up through the stratosphere, stopping briefly at the café weird just to further tickle our craniums. Some of the violence here is tough to watch, and it’s no surprise to find it was met with the inevitable charges of misogyny. Yet the culmination of it all puts some perspective on the violence witnessed, leading to a strangely profound and moving climax.

The less you know about it going in for the first time the better.

""Ravenous fan of dark, edgy movies & TV. They should glue you to the screen and stay in your dreams.""

Martyrs is one of a handful that describes that perspective to the T, and it is the kind of horror movie that you should go in completely clueless about the plot to enjoy the many twists that you won't see coming.

399057,jessetaylor,"My immediate response as soon as this finished was ""MASTERPIECE."" Lanthimos is back to _Dogtooth_-level craziness with this film and I couldn't be happier. _The Lobster_ was a favourite of mine in 2016, but something about this one's hopelessness drew me in more - odd, I know. Lanthimos' films have characters stuck in dead end situations where they are able to make a choice, but the results of the options are bad and worse. It's a dour story and the film is relentlessly unsettling, but this is what I've come to expect and want out of this Greek maestro.

Sacred Deer is a suburban Greek tragedy that draws inspiration from Euripides’ _Iphigenia in Aulis_ - a character even mentions this title in a key scene - and it plays out both as you'd imagine and with great shock and originality. Lanthimos and his writing partner Efthymis Filippou may just be my favourite writing team working today - they haven't let me down yet.

The cast is spectacular here with Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell in top form bringing the odd words of Lanthimos and Filippou to life - albeit a very, very strange life. Farrell, having worked with Lanthimos on The Lobster, had nothing but high praise for the director during tonight's Q&A after the screening of the film. He even said they were planning another project to work on together. He's slowly becoming a muse and their relationship is turning into a DiCaprio-Scorsese type partnership (except I look forward to these way, way more).

The audience I was in had a hard time with this film - there was audible shock and disgust during the film and the applause as it ended was slight. I think people were genuinely scandalized by this one and that makes me like it even more. Keep shocking audiences, Lanthimos, you Greek bastard.

399057,Gimly,"I am a big fan of some of Yorgos Lanthimos' earlier work, so _The Killing of a Sacred Deer_, which I had been told in no uncertain terms would be a straight up horror movie, was well and truly on the agenda for 2017. Unfortunately, I found that not only was _Sacred Deer_ not at all a horror, but more importantly that it lacked the dark whimsy of something truly odd, like the director's previous film, _Lobster_. Instead it opts for an outright uncomfortable tone. The world is real, boringly so, and it is only the characters who seem unbelievable. Which is a 180 on the sort of absurdism I usually gravitate towards. That said, _Sacred Deer_ still contains some beautiful cinematography, and a couple of the most genuine laugh-out-loud moments I've seen in a movie all year.

_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn’t quite work as a whole._",2017-12-10T05:16:26.168Z,5.0,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2017
399057,tmdb23156637,"Finally got the chance to see this via Amazon.

Dogtooth and The Lobster (from the same Greek director, who I must admit has a keen sense of storytelling) did not impress me at all. Very interesting ideas; atrocious presentations. Dogtooth was indecipherable and The Lobster is cruel, ugly, and not humorous in any fashion (I've no idea why it's billed as a black comedy.)

However, this latest film is entertaining to me despite it's grim and inky-black nature (based on the ancient Greek play, which is where the title is loosely derived from.) Perhaps it's a bit more straight-forward despite its cryptic nature, a bit more involved in some form of reality we can recognize and less inference as to what the hey is really happening. But I sure watched it w/ more interest than The Lobster (I've no interest in the director's film prior to that one.)

A successful heart surgeon (w/ a past history of alcoholism, sober for some time at present) is shown to have an uneasy alliance w/ the teenaged son of a patient who died on the operating table. It's clear the boy has some hold over this surgeon, who seems eager to please him but his heart's not into it (no pun intended.)

The boy's true intentions are revealed as events move forward; the surgeon's wife and two children (a few years apart, both intelligent in their own ways) are placed in grave danger as well as dear old Dad, and to reveal just how would spoil it for first-time viewers.

The camera-work here is impeccable, as are the jarring soundscapes, found-sounds, and industrial noise which makes for harrowing listening. The actor playing Martin, the teenaged oddball w/ a shared secret, is riveting to watch in a well-suited role. 

Sacred Deer isn't so much a horror-film as a drama w/ strong elements of dream-like reality, awkward young romance, and assorted chills and cold calculated sex-scenes involving ""playing dead"" and ""the other.""

My biggest complaints would be as before w/ this director's work: everyone speaks their lines as if hearing them through an ear-piece to parrot back, which makes the cast seem rather stilted and robotic. This director favors a weird tangent of ""Mamet-speak.""

The ending is about what you'd expect, following the matter-of-fact discussions which precede it. Up until that point Sacred Deer does a pretty good job keeping us wondering what will happen next, where will things lead, what is that kid's gift and whereupon was it bestowed; unfortunately the outcome isn't as entrancing or unexpected as I'd hoped.

But overall worth my time to watch. Considering how disappointed I was by the previous films by the director I'd watched (great reviews, all of which confounded and puzzled me) this film was much less of a bore and a chore to watch. A pleasant, unpleasant surprise indeed.",2017-12-23T02:08:32.777Z,7.0,The Killing of a Sacred Deer,2017
399057,5rJoud,"**What a shame this could have been excellent**

This film depicts the life of upper class people as we like to imagine it, and brilliantly so. The medical doctors couple have it all figured out, speak in complete sentences and are firm and polite. The house is gorgeous, the children are smart and well behaved. The setting of the story as a whole is very well done, believable and with great actors to boot.

The score is not so great. At times we have experimental ""music"" that just annoys and does nothing for the mood, but the visuals are exciting to watch, we have interesting camera angles, no shaking and clever zooms and motion.

The pace is slow, yet ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is never boring. There is always a plot twist which is explored after, things take their time but rightfully so.

Why the relatively detailed review for a 1.5 star rating? The problem is that the climax is just a huge letdown. The audience can't help themselves but wonder what is going on, guessing on the crime the apparently genius 16 year old villain commits. It is never explained. The makers thought it would be enough to have the bad guy win. It is not enough.

In the end everything good about the movie was negated by breaking the suspension of disbelief in a petty way, just ending the movie.

Even ""The Leftovers"" explained its phenomenon, and that show did not need to. There the mystery was the premise for character development, here the mystery is a tool to keep the viewer's attention.

I'd like to give less than 1.5 stars, because of how cheated I feel and because of the waste of talent and production value. But I'm sure there are people who love this and people who will learn from this.

399057,Nathan,"I found this to be one of the better Yorgos Lanthimos films, but I just cannot get behind his writing style. The stories he delivers are incredibly unique and I want to like them so much more than I actually do. Despite those drawbacks, _The Killing of a Sacred Deer_ was a mind-bending movie that threw me for a loop. The performances were great all around, as they should be with a star-studded cast featuring Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, and Barry Keoghan. The plot was incredibly twisted and dark. I enjoyed this film, but much like Lobster, and really wish there was a more modern spin on the writing instead of the short choppy and somewhat awkward framing that Lanthimos is known for.

I was left with unanswered questions.

There were several moments that were genuinely hilarious, but I'm not sure they were intended to be. 

The writing was also off, which didn't help the direction problems; because the performances were so robotic, the strange lines themselves became even more weird sounding. 

The score was maybe the worst part of the movie; at several times it completely broke the little tension that the film had managed to create. It was almost comedic sometimes, and at others it was way too heavy handed and trying to force me to see a scene a specific way.

First time I saw it 3 odd years ago I was not impressed.

Decided to give it another go though today, which I wish I hadn't cause it was even worse and more dull than I remember.

Now when I say dull I don't necessarily mean that it lacks action (it has a bunch of scenes with action, and being that these zombies run superfast unlike the typical zombies in film and series perhaps even a bit more than the average) but lack of interesting characters or good actors and any sort of originality in script makes it a tired ride.

Brad Pitt is not necessarily a great actor but he seriously did his most barebones performance here, you were just on the run from zombies with cars flying over and all kinds of stuff but you barely show any sort of emotion? Borderline Steven Segal territory ocassionally, or at the very least Jean Claude Van Damme... But without the fighting skills.

So yeah not an impressive film.",2017-03-14T23:47:18.896Z,4.0,World War Z,2013
72190,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"As with most zombie movies the plot is rather contrived and unbelievable (even if you accept the existence of zombies) but if you want to watch zombie movies in the first place that is something that you are supposed to be immune to.

This is another variant of zombies being created by some virus and rapidly taking over most of the planet. As I said, the entire story is somewhat unbelievable. When I first read about zombies as a kid there was always some supernatural/magic stuff involved. I think I liked that “explanation” much better than the virus nonsense which just have too many holes in it. For example there is no way a virus could make human bodies roam around aimlessly inside a sterile laboratory for days without nutrition. Well, as I said, it is a zombie movie so one just have to get over these little issues.

As an action movie with zombies as the main adversary it is a fairly good movie. The action is solid, the special effects okay and the entire movie continues at a reasonably brisk pace. Pitt is also doing a decent job of his role. There are few of the other actors that are very memorable though. The scenes where the zombies pile onto each other to scale walls and even reach choppers are rather cool. The movie is not very gory for being a zombie movie. Whether that is a good thing or not depends on the viewer I guess. Personally I do not mind some gory stuff in zombie movies.

There are a few annoying parts which Hollywood always seem to have to throw in. For example, the world is on the brink of the apocalypse and Lane and his wife just doesn’t want to get involved. What the f…? Also why do people always let their kids wander away in situations where they really should keep track of them? Not to mention how clumsy people always get when they have to sneak around and be silent. These things are just annoying.

Now this isn’t just your run-of-the mill American scenario - this is a truly global one. Fortunately for humanity, “Gerry” is a former investigator for the United Nations but don’t let that put you off, he’s actually not too shabby at his job so in order to preserve those dear to him, he agrees to work for Deputy Secretary General “Umatoni” (Fana Mokoena) in trying to find some sort of cure for the pathogen that’s causing all this turmoil. That takes him to Jerusalem and the via an handily placed Belarus airways plane to Cardiff where there might just be hope if he can get to an WHO laboratory before the virus does. To be fair, here, there are some great visual effects and the zombie make-up department have done wonders to turn ordinary human beings into maniacal beings without resorting to plasticine tendrils and exploding ketchup sachets. Pitt does fine as the cerebral but still energetic all-action hero and though there’s very little original about this, it does at least try to involve the whole world in the problem and in it’s potential solution which allows roles for Peter Capaldi and Elyes Gabel to bring an internationalist look to the adventures. Of those, there are quite a few and the human pyramid that storms the Israeli capital is maybe the high point as bullets and helicopters fly around all over that sacred site. The eagle-eyed amongst us might even spot the ever-gangly John Gordon Sinclair (remember “Gregory’s Girl” from 1980?) as a navy SEAL.

561,CinemaSerf,"After her sister rather uncharacteristically takes her own life by jumping from an hospital roof, detective “Dodson” (Rachel Weisz) determines to enlist the help of “Constantine” (Keanu Reeves) to help get to the bottom of things. He is renowned in the world of the menacingly spiritual, and so she hopes that he might be able to help her explain what drove her sibling to kill herself. It doesn’t take him, and his cabbie sidekick “Chas” (Shia LaBeouf) very long to realise that there are demonic activities afoot, and that none other than the angel Gabriel herself (Tilda Swinton) might have a hand in things. “Constantine” has been to hell, he has seen it’s atrocities and knows that he is destined to end up there himself unless he can convince God to intercede and allow him into heaven instead. To achieve this, he has dedicated his life to apprehending the malevolent spirits who cannot yet enter our world, but who can still cause mischief and mayhem, and despatch them back to their netherworld. Crucial to his detective work on this case is going to be the chair in which the last man in the city was electrocuted. This acts as a conduit to hell, but “Midnite” (Djimon Hounsou) is it’s keeper and he knows that to leave well alone is probably best. As their investigations deepen, both realise that they are at the centre of a plot that could see the entire planet fall under the control Satan - but can they thwart this plan in time? Both Reeves and Weisz are on good form with this well paced and creepy production that does take it’s time to get going, but once we get up an head of steam it’s a solid mystery with more emphasis on the story and the characters and less on the visual effects as it unfolds. Swinton features only sparingly, but both she and Hounsou add something to the sense of the menacing whilst LaBeouf brings a little light-heartedness to the plot with his amateur, but sometimes quite effective, contributions. As the battle lines become clearer for all, the film builds successfully to quite a gripping denouement that does ask a few questions about the nature of good, evil, heaven, hell, ambition and glass roofs.

Pitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. 

The year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, Twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake. 

Right from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter-Gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly (Mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity, then, that an eclipse is due... 

Okies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, Pitch Black is a variant of Alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade ""A"" from those involved. 

It's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an Islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. 

The narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the épée to Fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that Mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and Diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department. 

The setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. Twohy, Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. While the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off... 

The science and logic is hokey, but so what? This is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10",2015-06-04T21:52:23.990Z,9.0,Pitch Black,2000

I had heard of this character of his before, though didn't know a jot about the plot. It turns out it's fairly good, despite minor issues.

It has a noticeable low budget/low quality feel to it, the special effects haven't aged beautifully and the acting level is rather mid. Nevertheless, I still did enjoy the creatures and those onscreen do the job. It does attempt quite a bit of sci-fi, so I can respect it.

Diesel is effective in the role of Riddick, a character I can certainly see the potential for here. Kinda funny that he co-stars with Cole Hauser, who appears in <em>'2 Fast 2 Furious'</em> - the only F&F flick to not feature Vin. Hauser is solid enough, he does suit this sorta role.

From the director of 'Blue Ruin', yet another crime-thriller. This time it revolves around a rock band who trapped in the neo-nazi enclosure on the outskirt of the city. So how do they plan to get away from the green room they're locked in, and armed men are outside waiting for them to take down. The film filled with lots of tense moments and mostly unpredictable stuffs which is a one day event.

I was not surprised, I just expected something as smart as the director's previous film. He retained his favourite actor, Macon Blair to play an important role as their third collaboration in this multistarrer and he once again did well. This theme is not the first time explored, it is a well known, but the setting was very unique. All the actors were amazing, but truly very sad to hear the news about Anton Yelchin. He was a young and a wonderful actor and his '5 to 7' was my favourite.

At first, I thought the plot was so silly. I wondered why they did not use the excessive force as they're capable to tackle such situation. But that's the best part, because they threw away the cliché and approached for something new way to deal it. So the writer, I mean the director did great to carve a rare and thrilling film of the year.

There's no martial arts, criminal gang's collision or the cops fighting the bad guys; it was about how the normal people confront during a hostile situation in the real world. Blue and Green are done, now I'm waiting for the director to announce his next colour project.

11797,John Chard,"Feeling like a time warp now, but oh so much fun and frights.

Viewing this for the first time in 20 years really put a smile on my face, now I know that for after having just watched a horror film that may not be the best guideline you will ever read, but the film has it's tongue firmly in cheek and it doesn't come up short on the thrill factor.

You will read other reviews stating that the film is a little cheesy and a little dated, and sure, in this day and age of gorno and ultimate slash kill death murder movies, the film can be judged as tame alongside the big box office ghoul movies. But from a personal point of view I got such a kick out of watching a good honest genre piece that shows love, care, and entertainment rolled into one movie. Perhaps I'm the old fart who is so desensitised to blood horror these days? Perhaps I live in the past too much? So what? It matters not because as long as there are delightful genre pieces like this to remind me that the 80s horror crowd had some knowing style, then I'm a happy bunny.

Cute teens embroiled in Vampire next door plot is about the make up of the film. No one believes the central guy of the piece (William Ragsdale as Charley Brewster), but he convinces TV Vampire Slayer Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell) to join his quest to rid the neighbourhood of the murdering menace living next door. The film has the love interest in peril (Amanda Bearse), it has the grossly annoying best friend (Stephen Geoffreys) - and boy is he annoying! And it has all the homages to the horror classics gone by you could wish to have.

Such guts and gusto went into making this film I felt like clapping at the end. It's aware of the horror competition when you catch some of the dialogue, so it should never be allowed to become a perceived cheesy relic, because this is 1985 and it rocks for those that remember when horror had a glint in its eye instead of a sabre through its head. 8/10",2018-12-09T14:44:47.734Z,8.0,Fright Night,1985

Totally unexpected. I had no idea what I'm about to watch. Because usually I do small research of films I watch before the click play. I did not know it was even a French film or a horror. But it was not actually a horror in a sense. Seeing the initial set up, I thought it would be about a freshman medical student. Then things turned out strangely. Like it was decades ago when I was young, I have felt uncomfortable for those intentional film. For this, it felt all real. As the contents, I disliked them. But the film succeeded if that's what it's intended to give to its audience.

It lived up to what the title meant. But on the other hand, I thought it was making fun of vegetarians. You usually won't find many vegetarians in Europe, but this film's topic was bizarre. Because you know someone who has never consumed meat in his entire life, but then when he begins this new habit, it is like completely going out of control. It's not just one, but two from the same family. Something was very clear, that one not knowing the differences. Because they were never before used to it.

Justine is all set to join her sister to practice to be a veterinarian. Coming from a pure vegetarian family, she has to go through some of college traditions. From the beginning itself, it did not go well for her. It affected her health and body. A drastic change in a short period of time, forcing her to uncontrollable desire. Then on one accidental situation, it turns even worst. Ultimately, a conflict between the sisters arise. It takes them to unexpected paths and finally how it all ends were revealed with many uneasy events.

I have seen many films like this, but this one was a stand-alone from all of them. I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but they have got all things right just as they wanted. Obviously this is for grownups, though not all of them can watch without feeling disgust. Some of article, reviews says, people left the cinema hall halfway through. A very challenging film to watch. You might think I'm exaggerating for a simple cinematic performance, but that's what I really experienced. Only when you give it a try, you might get it.

A bit confusing as the story progressing. Like what kind of universe, it is set in. Because whatever happens around Justine, seems nobody caring. Where were the professors! So many doubts. It's just what it is. An imaginative perspective, what if kind of situation turned more uglier. But if you analyse it properly, the only issue was the cannibalism. Not that one showing a desire in consuming meat all of sudden. So, I appreciate the writing, direction and performances, but definitely it is not my cup of tea. Probably for most of you as well.

So this is not for all, but selected viewers. Films can be anything, only we have to assert whether we liked it or not. The maker knew what they were doing, the kind of subject they have undertaken for their film. Often a film like this hits the screen, and makes some noise among the film critics and film goers. I don't know on what merit one should decide to watch it. Because it is not for entertainment, nor an art, nor a message film. But I still think it is worth a watch. Just be aware of what you are going to watch.

That’s just the start of her problems though as it turns out her new roomie in the entirely functional gay lad “Adrien” (Rabat Nait Oufella) and their first week is going to see them undergo loads of frat-style challenges at the hands of their “elders”. She develops a nasty looking rash for which she gets some ointment but the rash appears to be symptomatic of something way more worrying. She is developing a taste for meat - and it’s cooking appears to be entirely optional. It’s beyond a craving, and - well let’s just say she doesn’t need a supermarket to procure her victuals. What’s happening to her, and is she the only one at this school who wants to eat the patients? Marillier is on top form here as this gore-fest becomes more entertainingly grisly. Her character becomes more and more desperate to feed then ashamed of just what she’s doing and she’s slowly going mad! It’s presented with it’s tongue in it’s cheek with some fairly graphic gruesomeness but also with plenty of sexually-charged humour, especially from the confident Oufella who’s “Adrien” probably doesn’t realise how precarious life with his new room-mate is about to become. It’s not especially scary, it more funny than frightening, and it’s an enjoyable take on the college horror genre that’s largely devoid of special effects and endless swearing and is just good fun.",2025-03-13T09:26:43.521Z,7.0,Raw,2016

She is the only survivor and after her recovery she takes up a job as the church organist in a new town, but she is constantly blighted by a ghostly like visitor and periods of time when nobody seems to know she exists.

A hinted spoiler follows.

Carnival Of Souls has thankfully found a whole new audience in the new millennium, the advent of cheap triple pack DVDs and a lush Criterion release have brought it firmly to the attention of Horror/Ghost fans who were not aware that the film even existed. That said, there is no doubting that many big name directors were fully aware of it, tho, for Carnival Of Souls has influenced such luminary genre masters from Romero to Carpenter, and from Hooper to Shyamalan, be it the low budget DIY ethic, or its now genre staple twist ending, it's a film (along with it's director Herk Harvey) that is referenced as much as it is copied.

The tag often used for the film is that it's an elongated Twilight Zone episode, and sure enough I think that is a perfect fit. Its whole structure feels like a part of that wonderful and amazing Rod Serling show, and for sure this story owes a doff of the cap to An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge (an Ambrose Bierce short that was reworked and used on Serling's show), but to merely suggest a retread of a previously used idea would be very unfair. Carnival Of Souls is full of eerie sequences that are dream like in quality yet goose pimply in effect. Scored at frequent intervals by a jangling organ shrill, the ghostly phantoms that plague poor Mary actually bring a shiver to the spine; while a surrealistic dance of the carnival is a stunning eerie highlight. It's a wonderfully brought together story that has one pondering uneasily from the get go, managing to jolt your senses adroitly with a very special ending.

With a small budget of only $30,000 and a cast of friends, Herk Harvey crafted one of the best independent horror sub-genre films ever made. Don't believe me? Then go ask Romero, Raimi or Hooper. 8/10",2014-03-29T18:10:57.447Z,8.0,Carnival of Souls,1962

A young woman (Candace Hilligoss) survives a vehicle accident in Lawrence, Kansas, and then is troubled by a specter (director Herk Harvey) and other strange occurrences as she moves to the Great Salt Lake region for a gig as a church organist.

""Carnival of Souls"" (1962) is an eerie, moody cult flick shot in B&W, but not scary at all. It's similar in vibe to ""Night Tide"" (1961) with Dennis Hopper. The creepiest part is the girl's lecherous neighbor in Utah (Sidney Berger). 

Besides the haunting ambiance, what I like best about it is the portrayal of two intersecting dimensions: Someone in the spiritual dimension can't be seen or (for the most part) heard in the physical realm. While it's overrated and predictable, it's still an interesting ghostly period piece.

The acting from Hilligoss and from Art Ellison as the savvy preacher is quite compelling to watch (the dialogue much less so) and as the plot thickens, the drama builds nicely into quite a tense little horror story with an effective organ-based score to help raise the tension too.

16093,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**Even bad movies deserve to have a place in history.**

After seeing this movie, I'm left with the feeling that it's a bit overrated, even though it's undoubtedly a remarkable classic of psychological horror. It's more rudimentary than one would expect, and the lack of means and resources is evident. On a very tight budget, director Herk Harvey deserves praise for the way he made the most of what he had and made an authentic labor of love. After reading a little, I realized that this was the only feature film of him and actress Candace Hilligoss. Their careers took an unhappy course towards obscurity, largely because of the critical and box office failure of this film which, only years later, and at the expense of TV and VHS, would become worthy of some notoriety.

The film begins with a clash between two cars where one of them, with three girls, falls into a river. After three hours of searching, Mary Henry, one of the occupants of this car, appears miraculously alive. She is a musical performer and, after a while, moves to Salt Lake City to work as an organist in a small church. However, she is a person without faith, for whom it is just a job. Shortly after arriving, she begins to have frightening visions and trances involving a man and an abandoned building, on the shores of Salt Lake, where an amusement park once existed.

The film is happy at building a mysterious and intriguing environment, but it never crosses the border into genuine horror. The sound and an organ soundtrack contribute enormously to this atmosphere (the organ, a very erudite instrument, gradually became umbilically linked to horror). The cinematography is raw and disagreeable, and the most interesting set is the Saltair Pavilion, which still exists, very modified and different from what it was in this film. The film cleverly uses local extras and actors to save money. However, the amateurism, the bad dialogues, the poverty of the script and the lack of a capable director completely compromise the effort of the cast. Even Candace Hilligoss looks bad. As we watch the film, we understand well the reasons that dictated its failure. As a film, it's a mediocre job, it's not even disturbing. So why on earth has it become so prestigious nowadays?

I believe that the key to understanding this lies in the “cult” phenomenon itself. The essence of this cultural movement lies in the search and recapturing of original material, somewhat forgotten or poorly appreciated in its time. And this film, as it turns out, is precisely within the genre of stuff sought after by “cult” followers. It is because of their action that this film won over its audience after a long time.",2023-06-17T14:54:18.682Z,4.0,Carnival of Souls,1962

The first of Universal's Mummy films follows the story of Imhotep (Karloff), who after being awaken from his tomb by expedition workers, believes his lover has been reincarnated in the body of a modern woman.

It's undeniably slow moving, it's stagy, and away from Karloff the acting and dialogue is just about reaching average qualities.

""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is undoubtedly one of the most unique installments in the MCU, thanks to Sam Raimi's distinctive visual style and his impressive ability to elude the Marvel formula by seriously venturing into the horror elements. Never has a film from the cinematic universe been so violent, bloody, and terrifying.

Benedict Cumberbatch and especially Elizabeth Olsen carry the complex story about the multiverse through Michael Waldron's flawed screenplay. The balance between the various storylines could be better, America Chavez is just one MacGuffin to reach another MacGuffin, and the journey through the multiple universes only compensates for the mind-blowing visual effects.

Some personal disappointment is associated with the cameos treatment and the lack of real-location filming. Overall, more was expected from what was supposed to be Phase Four's ""big movie"", but it's a solid entry into the top half of the franchise.""

453395,CinemaSerf,"Whilst I really did quite enjoy this - and it was great to be in a busy cinema again - it's really more of a testament to the skills of the VFX guys rather than to any of the writers. The story is really pretty thin with the engaging and confident Benedict Cumberbatch joining forces with the charismatic and feisty young Xochitl Gomez' ""America"" - a young lady who has been appearing in his dreams. Turns out, she can cross from one universe to another - and soon both are being sought by the mighty Elizabeth Olsen's ""Wanda Maximoff"" (surely a ""Bond"" girl?) who wants control of time so she can get back to her lost family, yada yada... Benedict Wong features sparingly, but always adds a little value as the ""Sorcerer Supreme"" and there are a few cameos from Charlize Theron and Sir Patrick Stewart to help prop up what is, admittedly, a pretty meagre second half. I think this multiverse strand could provide Marvel with the gift that keeps on giving, but they have got to tighten the pace up - two hours for this was just too long; the plot doesn't sustain it and though the combat scenes are nothing to the length in the ""Avengers"" movies; there is still far too much slack here.

Not so much of the Marvel wit and humor that are more like to hold me, the anything but average fan, or rather,not a fan at all, though I do like science fiction.

For me, the 500 pound elephant in the room that cast a shadow over the entire movie was the villain. Now if you haven’t seen the film yet this may count as a spoiler, though it is revealed fairly early on. But the former heroine turned evil one is a woman taken over by the dark side. But what got me was her motive. Not to take over the world or the universe or the multiverse, but rather because she wanted to be a mommy to kids she lost along the way, or never had, or something. Billions of people in multiple universes died because she didn’t want to adopt. 

It seems like inserting herself into one universe might have been enough for you or me, but I suppose she wanted more options open if something went wrong with the first kids whose mother she killed (or is it her alternate self?) to get hold of. Dr. Strange even asked about it once, and she blithely explained that if her new old kids got terribly sick, she could find the cure for anything in other universes. She is the perfect mom, doing anything for her kids; well, except for providing moral leadership and showing them the path to be a good person who helps others and contributes to the world around them. Yeah, do as I say, kids, not as I do.

A Marvel movie so different than the rest... while still just like the rest. With the introduction of the Multiverse, this movie took full advantage of the opportunity to explore new worlds, new variations on familiar characters, and character cameos that Marvel fans have been desperately waiting for! I enjoyed Raimi's horror influences on the MCU. Unfortunately, the movie propelled itself from start to finish at breakneck speed, preventing the story from really taking advantage of the exciting cameos and roster of characters. The pace also jumped past true character motivations making the average audience confused and unsympathetic towards a formerly well-accepted hero now turned villain.",2022-08-20T00:23:43.314Z,7.0,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,2022
756999,CinemaSerf,"The thing about adapting a short story for cinema is that we tend to get a great deal of padding to get it to the duration. This film is certainly guilty of that, with the first half hour spent on way too much character establishment that really has very little to do with the gist of the story. Once it does get going though, it's a cleverly crafted and well put together scary movie centred around ""Finn"" (Mason Thames). Bullied at school, he is protected by his friend ""Robin"" (Miguel Cazarez Mora) until he disappears. He isn't the first child to disappear either, indeed five from this small community have gone missing over the last few weeks. ""Finn"" is walking home after school when he encounters a man who has dropped his groceries. Offering to help, next thing he knows he is in a grubby basement with only a soiled mattress and a disconnected phone on the wall. His mask-clad captor - who has something of the ""Joker"" about him - insists he is in no danger, but the phone on the wall starts to ring and the callers - the other five victims - warn him otherwise, and help him to try to best his nemesis. There are one or two jump moments, but mostly there is an effectively accumulating sense of menace well fuelled by confident efforts from Thames and his sister ""Gwen"" (Madeleine McGraw) who might have inherited her mother's ability to see the future in dreams - a skill that may prove vital in helping the police save her brother from certain death. There are violent undertones, but very little actual violence is shown as the young man comes to terms with some of his own demons and to try to escape. The last ten minutes redeem it well, and there is something distinctly satisfying about the conclusion. Scott Derrickson has provided us with one of the better Blumhouse dramas of recent years that is sure worth a watch.",2022-06-25T06:24:38.927Z,7.0,The Black Phone,2021

""The Black Phone carries a horror premise with a supernatural touch full of potential, but it plays too safe by betting on a narrative that's too simple, predictable, and repetitive.

Scott Derrickson elevates his work with a distinct style, and the fact that the main focus belongs to the protagonists development rather than on generic jumpscares pleases me.

Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw are, without a doubt, the most impressive elements of the entire film, delivering two of the best performances by young actors of the last decade. Ethan Hawke is underused, just like his unexplored character.

I recommend it, but personally, I expected something more creative.""

756999,Nathan,"The Black Phone is a paranormal abduction thriller that balances the tension/despair of being trapped and the ghost elements very well. The movie does a great job setting up the main characters in the beginning that gives you a relationship with them and genuine desire for them to succeed. There are a few plot points that are a little questionable, but are they are minor nitpicks and didn’t pull me out of the story too much. The performances all around were great. Ethan Hawke does fantastic in his limited screen time. He conveys the mental state of the Grabber with such nuance, it really makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. The children do very well too, especially in the more emotionally heavy scenes. A few of the classmates performances in the beginning were a bit awkward.  Overall, I had a great time with this movie and it is a testament to the directors and writers that they could adapt such a creative thriller from a short story.

THE BLACK PHONE is suspenseful and scary without the need to have onscreen violence (the violence is mostly off-screen). The cast is excellent, particularly Thames and McGraw, who both give standout performances. Thames is particularly convincing as the terrified boy who is trying to make sense of the situation he's in. Hawke is also chilling as the killer, though his character is not as fleshed out as I would have liked.

The film was based on the collection of a series of the real events that takes place in the 17th century New England. The story of a farmer family who came across the ocean, but now lives on the edge of the forest after denied permission to build a house in a village. When the newborn baby disappears in a thin air, the family begins to experience the mysterious events. Without a clue about the happenings, the evil force begins to possess them while the unity of the family is tested.

Wow, finally a wonderful horror-psychological-thriller. Usually horror films are the worst kind compared with other genres, because most of them overly rely on the sudden sound/noise and gore. But there are many awesome horror films I had liked which were better story than the graphical presentation, like this one. So I love good narration than those try to scare me with make-ups, stunts and sound mixings.

It was a limited cast film, sets in a beautiful remote place and the language was awesome that perfectly suits for the horror theme like this. Everyone's performance was brilliant. It is just a one million dollar film and the entire film was shot within a month. The records are not matter when the writing and the direction were top notch. Especially for a first timer it was a remarkable achievement.

A simple plot, developed greatly and the suspense was the highlight. Yet viewers expect more explanation, but I'm happy for what it is and it should not go deeper than that which might spoil its unique flavour. Not just horror film fans, everyone should try it if they're capable to handle the slow narration. Finally, like usual, here I won't ask for a sequel, because it'll make an amazing one off film than the dozens of crappy follow ups.

310131,mattwilde123,"This was a really good horror film. The direction was very interesting and Robert Egger plays with darkness and shadows in a really horrifying way. The tension is unbearable at times.

The dialogue is a bit hard to follow as it is very ""oldé English"" to add to the historical accuracy of the piece. The actors are all good at reciting this strange dialect and demonstrating the paranoia spreading through the family thanks to religion and superstition.The film is based on accounts and texts found from the era and so everything seen on screen has been taken from sources and barely been touched. Every part of the film seems authentic.

It is refreshing to see a film that doesn't really on jump-scares and annoying ""cattle-prod"" techniques to make audiences scared. 'The Witch' is genuinely disturbing without resorting to these techniques. It is very strange and gory when it needs to be. I also found these strange scenes quite fascinating and educational as the film almost seems like a historical document.

310131,Sheldon Nylander,"Talk about old school!

“The Witch” is a painstaking recreation of Puritan life in New England. The lifestyle is mimicked. The clothes are period-accurate. The dialogue is actually based off of documents and speeches from that time. It’s as if Mel Gibson decided to update “The Passion of the Christ” by 1600 years.

As mentioned, the movie is set in Puritan New England as a family is banished from the larger community and has to make their own way out in the wilderness. As they build their home, strange things begin to happen, starting with the abduction of the infant Samuel. Things continue to get worse and worse, until… okay, no spoilers. See the movie.

This is a dark and effective movie. I can’t remember the last time I actually had a start from the all too often used jump scares, but the movie is absorbing enough that it did manage to “get” me a couple times. Robert Eggers seems to have kicked off a new wave in old-school, deep supernatural and existential horror. I won’t lie that I drew some comparisons between this and Ari Aster’s “Hereditary,” if nothing else than by simply the way the movie felt and left me feeling at the end.

That being said, the film isn’t perfect. In fact, oddly enough, it’s perfection is what gives it imperfection. The period is so painstakingly recreated, in particular the dialogue, that sometimes hearing it can be jarring, making me stop for just a second to think about what was just said, which unfortunately interrupts the flow and managed to pull me out of the film. It’s kind of a strange complaint that something could be so accurate that it fails to suspend disbelief, but here we are.

“The Witch” is quite an achievement and I’m glad that this film, which would otherwise be relegated to underground status, has managed to achieve a following, enough so that Robert Eggers got to do a follow-up with the Lovecraftian-looking “The Lighthouse.” Definitely worth checking out.",2019-10-24T10:38:35.925Z,8.0,The VVitch: A New-England Folktale,2015
310131,r96sk,"<em>'The Witch'</em>, Robert Eggers' feature directorial debut, is very good! I enjoyed all of these 90 minutes, I could've watched it go on for a little longer in truth. I really liked the atmosphere throughout, as well as the look of the film. The dialogue is particularly excellent, too.

Everyone on the cast gives a terrific performance, shown perfectly by that final scene with them all together onscreen. Harvey Scrimshaw is super convincing in the aforementioned, I was almost questioning if they had got an adult actor and morphed him into Caleb, such was his high performance.

Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson are class in that scene too, one of the most unsettling moments in this is as their characters convulse on the floor - that sorta thing with kids always creeps me out. I've gone too far into my review to not note Anya Taylor-Joy, who is quality from beginning to end. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie merit props as well.

I mentioned in my recent review of (the good) <em>'Nosferatu'</em> that I was unsure how this one was going to fare in my personal ranking of this director's work, given the stark contrast with my thoughts on <em>'The Lighthouse'</em> (4/10) and <em>'The Northman'</em> (9/10). In actuality, this falls a notch below the latter; not far off the same rating, fwiw.

Pardon the pun, but you would think that by this time, everything in the land of zombie movies would have been done to death, but I remain consistently admiring of just where the best and most thought-out renditions of the template can go. In THIS case, the most intriguing dynamic is a cowardly husband choosing his life rather than helping his wife out of a horrible crisis, then infanticide (or worse) of his own children, rather than face their wrath over the poor decision he had made.

It's interestingly hilarious that when you think about it, humanity is doomed because a 12-year-old had to go back and get a picture of his mother, because he was afraid that without it, he would forget what she looked like...A surprisingly satisfying work, that for horror fans, is worth a purchase and rewatching.

1562,John Chard,"We have an outbreak of the infection in medical center. All units; safeties off. 
 
28 Weeks Later is directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo who also co-writes with Rowan Joffe, Jesus Olmo and E. L. Lavigne. It stars Robert Carlyle, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, Harold Perrineau, Catherine McCormack, Mackintosh Muggleton and Imogen Poots. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Enrique Chediak.

Six months have passed since the Rage Virus decimated the UK, but now people are returning to London's District 1 with the U.S. Military overseeing the project. However, the Rage Virus can be carried in people with no outward symptoms.

After the monster success of ""28 Days Later"" it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. With director/writer combo Danny Boyle and Alex Garland off making ""Sunshine"" with Cillian Murphy, the big players from the first film were missing (Boyle and Garland were Executive Producers here). There was reasonable cause for some concern that this would be the latest in a long line of horror sequels that, quite frankly, suck the big one. How great to find that not only is ""Weeks"" an excellent sequel, it also doesn't sit idle and copy Boyle's winning formula.

The blood and ick factor is considerably amped up, as is the action (there's running, lots of running, guns, lots of guns, panic, lots of panic), but the writers have put intelligence into the writing by expanding on the Rage Virus victims as not just being an outwardly ferocious beast, and some topical smarts are spliced into the narrative with the presence of the American military ""enforcing"" the reconstruction of London. Also, with the film's central focus being on a splintered family, brilliantly set up by the breathtaking/horrifying opening 10 minutes, there's a mighty heft of humanism flowing in between the blood vomit and body shredding.

Cast are mostly terrific, with Carlyle and the impressive young actors, Poots and Muggleton, leading the way. The American lads playing military men have to make do with slender written stock roles, but Byrne provides spunk and McCormack leaves an indelible mark in a small, but key, role. Fresnadillo (Intacto) ensures Boyle isn't missed in the director's chair, with a keen eye for action construction and an awareness of pacing for such a horror movie. While Murphy again scores with that knack for doom mongering beats. There's some missteps, logic at times goes out the window and in the case of Renner's character, outcome is a bit too much of a bitter pill to swallow. While dialogue at times shops at ""Clichés ""R"" Us"". But this is still a mighty fine thrill ride, often scary and stomach turning, and even flecked with emotional worth. On this evidence a part 3 would be most welcome. 8/10",2019-10-09T09:41:29.021Z,8.0,28 Weeks Later,2007

1562,Ricardo Oliveira,"""28 Weeks Later"" is a British horror movie directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and starring Jeremy Renner and Rose Byrne. The film is a sequel to the critically acclaimed ""28 Days Later"" and takes place six months after the original film's events.

The film opens with a tense and heart-pounding sequence as a group of survivors try to escape the infected hordes of London. The scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie, which is filled with suspense and tension.

The plot centers around the repopulation of London, which is deemed safe after the outbreak of the Rage Virus six months earlier. The story follows the reunion of a family that was separated during the initial outbreak, and their struggle to survive when the virus returns.

The film's pacing is excellent, with a gradual buildup of tension that leads to several heart-stopping moments. The infected humans are just as terrifying and violent as in the first film, and the film's use of sound and lighting is once again top-notch.

One of the standout features of ""28 Weeks Later"" is the excellent acting by Jeremy Renner and Rose Byrne. Renner delivers a convincing performance as Don, a father struggling to protect his children and come to terms with his actions during the initial outbreak. Byrne also shines as Scarlett, a medical officer trying to find a cure for the virus.

The film's themes of family, loyalty, and sacrifice are powerful and thought-provoking. As the family struggles to survive, they are forced to confront the difficult choices that come with the end of the world.

The film's cinematography and visual effects are also impressive, with haunting and memorable shots of a deserted London and intense action sequences.

Overall, ""28 Weeks Later"" is a solid horror movie that is not quite as groundbreaking as its predecessor but still delivers a thrilling and engaging experience. The film's excellent acting, pacing, and visuals make for an intense and unforgettable experience. I would rate ""28 Weeks Later"" an 7 out of 10.

I didn't care for the end all that much, which does damage how I view this unfortunately. Overall it fails to match the original, though does still offer OK post-apocalypse fare.

It is pretty strong in regards to the cast list, which is probably the only area that this can claim that it matches the predecessor (even if I prefer the 2002 cast, obvs). Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner and Idris Elba were people I was happy to see appear, while Robert Carlyle & Co. are solid.

10439,BadChristian,"I imagine most of the love for Hocus Pocus comes from people who re-watch it with nostalgia goggles. Even as a child of the 90's I had never seen Hocus Pocus and knew little of it, so I had no prior attachments to this film. If you have seen any of the Disney Channels terrible made for TV movies, Hocus Pocus is like a particularly bad one with some questionable language and sexual innuendo. The acting is really bad from the entire cast, which is a little surprising considering the witches (who I had always assumed you the heroes of the story, but are clearly not) are two D-List actresses (Bette Midler and Kathy Najimy) and a C-lister (Sarah Jessica Parker) who aren't exactly known for their acting abilities, but are actual professional actresses. The CG effects are bad, even considering this is a 1993 movie and the practical effects aren't even an honest effort. All of this could be forgiven if it was part of a fun, campy family movie, but Hocus Pocus can't even pull that off. The plot is lame and full of inconsistencies and just unreasonably unrealistic moments. The witches have been ""dead"" for 300 years, but will be brought back if a virgin lights the black flame candle. In 1990 a high school boy says multiple times publicly that he is a virgin. Let me just say that again, they think a high school boy would go around announcing himself to be a virgin repeatedly to his peers. This is a public high school in Massachusetts in the 90's, not a Mormon town or a private Catholic school. When the witches return, they have been gone for 300 years and don't even know what the paved road is, thinking it to be a river or what a bus is; they have no knowledge of any of the advances since the 1600's. Having established this, one of the witches flies up to the side of a car on their broom and asks him for his license and registration. So, they don't understand asphalt, but they know motorist jokes? The movie is littered with inconsistencies and a wild lack of understanding of how teenagers and children think and act. Even the three witches can't maintain a consistent character. Bette Midler is supposed to be the smart older sister, but she acts the most irrationally and whines like a child. Sarah Jessica Parker is a horny dumb blonde and Kathy Najimy is a mentally challenged woman who barks an talks out of the side of her mouth, but they are always the ones to reason and plan. Najimy is the worst, with her constantly swinging from offensively stupid the brains of the operation. This was an actual movie released in theaters. Had it been a cheap Disney Channel original, it would still be terrible, but excusable. As a real theatrical film, Hocus Pocus is embarrassing. Unless you grew up with this film, I can't imagine you getting much out of this. It's fairly unoffensive children's drivel, with some questionable language if that's all you need, but it's not a good film.

Sometimes it is fun to get in the way back machine to visit ""classic"" movies, but they don't always hold up.  And in some cases, like this, it is a wonder they EVER worked at all.  Especially that it is a 1993 Disney movie and focuses on sex, plus a lot of witch lore being based on women being sexual in a time where it was so inappropriate they would be burnt at the stake.  I digress.

While the Sanderson sisters are a compelling premise, if sloppy, and an interesting metaphor for the desires of power, hunger, and sex, it goes to an almost cartoonish levels of ridiculous for next to no reasoning.

All the non witch cast do a fine job, and I especially liked Thora Birch's performance, I can see why she took off so well.  As for the witch cast, I have no doubt they did was in the script very well, but the script is overly ridiculous, and even just trying to relax there are jokes that make no sense and just aren't all that funny.

It popped... and, yeah, there was a story here too.

This was the 90s, it was that time where they could make a children's movie that was still a little dark, a children's movie that was still entertaining for adults to watch. In other words, they made a FAMILY movie, and that hasn't been done lately has it?

You can watch it as an adult and love it because it has a real plot, it has jokes that are above the low brow children's fair, and jokes that cater to them as well. It takes an effort to be appealing to ALL age groups.

And, as I said, it has a plot that you can follow, which again is new for the modern family film which are more or less a series of scenes loosely linked together.

9003,JPV852,"Hellraiser is probably one of the lesser of the horror franchises from the 80s behind Halloween (yes, I know that came out in 1978), Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. This is a movie I’ve seen a few times over the years and while it’s hardly a perfect horror film with a clunky set-up, it’s still a lot of fun as the make-up and effects work perhaps is a bit on the cheesy side yet kind of still holds up in a strange way.

The acting is nothing special, though I did like both Clare Higgins and Ashley Laurence, not to mention Doug Bradley in the role of “Lead Cenobite”, who would later be called Pinhead. Kind fascinating that character was accidentally propelled into being a horror icon as he was only a minor part of the film, though based on his design and overall look, not hard to see why he resonated with horror fans.

Hellraiser, written and directed by Clive Barker based on his novella, isn’t a favorite of mine, as mentioned I lean more toward the more reality based slasher (like Halloween and F13) than the supernatural variety, but still found this to be entertaining as a whole. **3.75/5**",2019-09-18T19:06:03.309Z,8.0,Hellraiser,1987

11542,Wuchak,"***“Night of the Apeman” mixed with some pretty heady material***

In the late 60s and mid-70s, a psychopathologist (William Hurt) from the New York/New England area honestly seeks ultimate truth and the origins of humanity through dubious experiments with sensory deprivation mixed with drugs, including a potent mixture used in ceremonies by Mexican AmerIndians. This leads to altered states of consciousness and amazing primordial revelations. Blair Brown is on hand as his romantic interest while Bob Balaban and Charles Haid appear as his colleagues, the latter a scientific version of a Pharisee.

Directed by Ken Russell, “Altered States” (198o) is a mature sci-fi drama with elements of mystery/horror. It comes across as a meshing of movies like “Wolfen” (1981), “An American Werewolf in London” (1981), Russell’s later “The Lair of the White Worm” (1988) and “2001: A Space Odyssey” (1968). One of the fascinating things about the movie is that it shows how a person can reach other realms while in an isolated location through the power of the mind/spirit, albeit in this case with the assistance of drugs.

I can relate to a degree. For instance, eleven years ago I was sleeping in bed (during the day) having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. This happened again the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy?

Anyway, the apeman sequence is one of the best parts of the movie and recalls those werewolf flicks noted above (of course “Wolfen” isn’t really a werewolf picture). But “Altered States” is so much more than a standard creature feature or nature-runs-amok flick. The apeman make-up is great and the bizarre imaginings are similar to the same in “The Lair of the White Worm.” While I disagree with the evolutionary nonsense (humans didn’t evolve from apes, rolling my eyes), this is a fantasy about finding the truth by Ken Russell and so I don’t expect those kinds of details to be accurate anyway.

Blair is winsome in a girl-next-door kind of way and Russell doesn’t fail to capture her beauty (and I’m not tawkin about the top nudity), although that’s there too, if you’re interested.

I suggest using the subtitles since a lot of the jargon is pretty technical. It helps the viewer to stay with the story if you can understand what the characters are saying and discussing.

The movie runs 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot in New York City (including the Bronx Zoo); Boston; Sierra Tarahumara, Chihuahua, Mexico (the rock formations); Burbank Studios and a VA hospital in Los Angeles.

Stir of Echoes is written and directed by David Koepp who adapts from the novel of the same name written by Richard Matheson. It stars Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Zachary David Cope, Illena Douglas, Jennifer Morrison, Kevin Dunn and Conor O'Farrell. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Fred Murphy.

Chicago phone engineer Tom Witzky (Bacon) submits to being hypnotised by his sister-in-law and finds that his young son's imaginary friend is not imagined after all...

Undeniably lost in the slip-stream of the similar themed ""The Sixth Sense"", Stir of Echoes screams out to be seen by more fans of supernatural mysteries. It's a near faultless production, with Koepp getting all the key ingredients right on both the page and in transfer to the screen. Pacing is often the problem with films of a similar ilk, but Koepp deftly structures it in three engrossing sections.

First third establishes the main characters and the supernatural set-up, but the bonus here is that character reactions are believable, especially with Erbe's confused wife. Koepp has a great sense of atmosphere whilst ensuring we are fully immersed in Tom Wizky's new world of disorientation by way of terrifying visions and red light shocks. Second third brings the chills and the odd boo-jump, again the director is aware that too many jumps can overkill the plot, so they are nicely spaced out and accompanied by a palpable fear of the unknown. Then the last third unravels in a whirl of Roy Neary like obsessions and ghosts of the past denouements. It's a standard formula, yet it's amazing just how often film makers get it wrong, especially in horror. Not a problem here. 

Film is further boosted by Newton Howard's score that blends the ethereal with rising thunder and Murphy's colour photography, the latter of which helps to paint a harmonious Chicago neighbourhood, soon to be turned upside down, literally at one end of the street. The acting is super, which in Bacon's case is a given to anyone who has followed his career, and Koepp shows some nice and creepy visual filming techniques to further enhance the great Richard Matheson's story. There's the odd little misstep, such as a thread involving a secret organisation that has the ""gift"" of being ""open"" to the supernatural, that feels like filler to over state Tom's torment. While the post reaction to a suicide attempt isn't given nearly enough screen time to really add impetus to the unfolding mystery. But small complaints only, for Stir of Echoes (great title) remains a truly involving and entertaining supernatural mystery. 8.5/10",2019-10-16T23:11:30.698Z,9.0,Stir of Echoes,1999
10973,Dsnake1,"Creature from the Black Lagoon is a fairly straight-forward horror film, but even sixty-five years later, it still works. 

The movie plays on the fear of the unknown creature. Deep in the Amazon Rainforest, there might be some kind of ancient, half-fish-half-man horror that sets out to kill all humans who come into its territory. Maybe it even wants to steal away the women to continue living. That's a scary thought, in and of itself.

When you add that to the movie's best quality, the score, it makes for some truly chilling, truly tense scenes. The whole film is well done, especially for 1954. The set design is fully believable, and the acting is solid all around. Julie Adams specifically does a great job.

10973,John Chard,"We didn't come here to fight monsters, we're not equipped for it.

Out of Universal Pictures, Creature from the Black Lagoon is directed by Jack Arnold, and stars Richard Carlson, Julia Adams, Richard Denning, Antonio Moreno, and Whit Bissell. The eponymous creature was played by Ben Chapman on land and Ricou Browning for the underwater scenes. The cinematography is by William E. Snyder and the score is composed by a trio of men, Henry Mancini, Hans J. Salter & Herman Stein. The story sees a scientific expedition at the top end of the Amazon encounter a Devonian Period amphibious creature. As the creature starts to defend its turf by attacking members of the expedition, in fighting begins to take a hold as the men argue about the best course of action to take. Should it be killed, or should it be captured for scientific research? Either way they need to act fast as the creature has taken a fancy to Kay, the sole female member of the expedition group.

One of the better creature features that surfaced in the 1950s, Creature from the Black Lagoon was one of the film's made as part of the 3D craze that filtered out of Hollywood in 53 & 54. However, unlike many of those film's that were made in the format over those two years, this one has rightly managed to break away from its gimmicky beginnings to become regarded as a genre classic. There are many reasons why it is still well regarded and taken in appreciatively by newcomers.

The story of course is nothing new, the old ""beauty & the beast"" theme can be traced back to the daddy himself, ""King Kong"". But much like Kong, Arnold's movie thrives within the endearing story by getting the audience to sympathise with the titular creature. He is after all only defending his territory, he was happy wallowing down in the depths, remaining undiscovered for many a moon. That he is fascinated by the considerable beauty of Kay Lawrence (Adams sexy and gorgeous), is no crime either. The amount of sympathy garnered for ""Gill-Man"" is helped enormously by the illogical actions of the humans; who in turn go diving and swimming where legend has it men get eaten! This coupled with their bickering about pro science or trophy hunting makes it easy to side with the amphibious one.

It also helps that the film is pretty brisk and only runs for 80 minutes, there's no sags or pointless filler. Too many similar film's of its ilk labour until the monster shows up and all hell then breaks loose. But under Arnold's (It Came From Outer Space/The Incredible Shrinking Man) astute direction, atmosphere and unease is built up by ominous talk and sightings of the Black Lagoon-and only initial glimpses of the creature's scaly webbed claw; accompanied by the attention grabbing theme music. And when the creature finally reveals itself it doesn't disappoint for its an impressive creation. A half-man/half-fish creature covered in scales, resplendent with gills and with cold, dark featureless eyes. It also has great characteristics with a distinctive swimming style in the water, and a lumbering Frankenstein thing going on when on the land. A definitive monster that would be merchandised for ever after.

There's also technical accomplishments away from the creature itself, notably with the memorable underwater photography by Snyder, who uses a portable camera to flow with the swimming sequences, while his shadow and light work down in the depths is memorably mood enhancing. The three tiered score is also one of the best to feature in a ""B"" movie schlocker, three different composers, three different emotional strands; nice. Then there's of course the definitive sequence, the sexy underwater flirting as ""Gill-Man"" swims below the shapely form of Kay, beguiled by her, it's love at first sight. He's not the only one beguiled, we all are, as was Steven Spileberg, who would homage the more dramatic part of the sequence in his opening for Jaws 21 years later. Whilst last but not least it should be mentioned that there are little asides to ecological issues in the piece, something Arnold was want to do. Two sequels would follow, Arnold would return for ""Revenge Of The Creature"" in 1955 and then the John Sherwood directed ""The Creature Walks Among Us"" would round off the trilogy in 1956.

For a film made so long ago, it really does age nicely. Sure some of the ways used to bring the creature to life look a little dorky in patches, but for the most part I felt the required creepiness - especially via the creature's face. It has the feel of a very well made production, which is little surprise given it's a Universal production of course. I also like how it has a sense of knowledge to it, who knows if it all adds up but it sounds the part at least.

The special effects also were incredible (here in 2012, when special effects have progressed so far, for me to mention the special effects in a truly film marks them as something special).

""Nope contains extraordinarily immersive technical elements, but the thematic focus raises narrative issues.

Jordan Peele takes full advantage of Hoyte van Hoytema's phenomenal cinematography and Michael Abels' memorable score to create a spectacle worthy of the big screen, but it's the sound production that really elevates the movie to that level.

Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, and Steven Yeun are exceptional, but the latter is tied to an extremely thematic storyline - immensely rich - with little to no impact on the main plot, leaving countless questions unanswered and a divided audience while still affecting the overall pacing.

Humor is surprisingly effective, and the moments of suspense and tension deliver what viewers most desire. A film that deserves multiple viewings and will generate endless debates.""

Nope's characterisations are moderately relatable but somehow, also seem to appear oddly misconstrued. The mostly monosyllabic cowboy character, for example, only adds to the sense of ambiguity (perhaps that's the idea).To my mind however, this ploy, if that's what it is, stifles development, of the already ambiguous, story line. The sister, his complete antithesis, is superficially verbose but seems equally, to lack any depth of self awareness.

The only thing I can say conclusively about Nope, is the visuals are  compelling, complex and, at times, almost intricate. This film certainly scores a A+ in this regard. 

That said, so much else is lacking, in particular a clearly articulated narrative, that it failed to resonate, with me.

Jordan Peele's 'Nope; comes in with some big expectations due to Peele's previous work. 'Get Out' shifted the paradigm for horror movies, taking a genre which has historically been associated with a temporary experience of thrill and adrenaline, to being social commentaries on society and raising some deeper questions about ourselves in the process of watching his stories unfold.

Nope is no exception, and in fact it can be argued that it attempts to combine story, metaphor and meaning in a more ambitious way than his previous outings. Taking the central theme of 'spectacle', Peele beautifully illustrates its dangers and how we as a society are so obsessed with the spotlight to our own detriment (and even int he worst cases, eventual demise). Choosing a more science fiction approach this time around, Peele does a great job of story telling, and often subvert's out expectations time and time again in the process. Aside from the film's deeper meaning, some of the other highlights come in the form of the cinematography and performances from the central characters (mostly notably, OJ, Emerald and Angel). Peele has managed to create some complex characters which are highly relatable, and the chemistry between the actors is something which will be a lasting memory for me.

However, I do feel that the film does sacrifice plot and narrative in its relentless effort to hammer in the metaphor of the central theme - 'Spectacle'. While I did enjoy each story (OJ and the Animal Alien and Gordie and Jupe), I had a hard time understanding the relationship they had with each other from a narrative point of view. It often felt like two stories could have been played out better without the interference of the other. Other than that I did have some questions around OJ's motivations to tame / kill this animal, the legitimacy of the final impossible shot, the nature and behaviour the animal, and how / if OJ survived (or was this open for interpretation?). The ending of the film also was a slight let down with the death of the animal not being all that grand. This however could also be tied into the overall message of 'Spectacle' as the finale is often not worth the what we expect it to be.

Overall, I think Nope is a very good movie which will probably get better with a few re-watches to fully appreciate what Peele was trying to tell us.",2022-09-07T07:26:25.444Z,7.0,Nope,2022

The journey our characters take in immense in terms of emotion and distance. I had such a great time watching our leads travel across country going wherever their hearts desired or wherever their noses took them. There were some creepy and intense encounters that had me on the edge of my seat but that was balanced with intimate moments between our leads. These scenes fill the majority of the 2 hour and twenty-minute runtime, and while that is a decently long film, it flew by, and the pace never seemed to lull. There were some scenes that could have been cut to save some time, but I argue that they were essential for character development and to make the film whole.

Throughout the course of the runtime there are intense introspective themes of morality that are at constant play. Watching the characters balance desire and need was so heartbreaking and real. Despite the horrific acts our main characters are performing, there is a deep hidden shame that seeps out as our character learns more and more about what she is.

These are very complex emotions to handle on screen and our two leads absolutely nailed it. Both Taylor Russell and Timothée Chalamet were brilliant! I will be honest, Timothée Chalamet is one of the big reasons why I wanted to see this movie so much and while he did an excellent job, he was outshined by Taylor Russell. She was so excellent, honestly perfect! This is the first film I have seen her in, and I was blown away. She deserves all the award recognitions for this film.

Bones and All is a masterpiece and needs to be seen in theaters. This is a hard movie to sell to an audience, but it was done perfectly and deserves all the credit, awards, and viewership.

791177,CinemaSerf,"""Maren"" (Taylor Russell) sneaks out of her home to visit her girlfriends one night only for one of them to discover that she has a peculiar appetite - and I'm not talking sexually! Forced to flee with her father, who subsequently abandons her, she decides to try to track down her mother. A few bus journies later, she encounters the enigmatic ""Sully"" (Sir Mark Rylance) with whom she shares a snack and from whom she discovers a little more about her nature. Still, he makes her very nervous so she continues her journey alone where next she encounters ""Lee"" (Timothée Chalamet) after an altercation in a grocery store. He also has the same nourishment predilections and so the two start to bond. He helps her with her familial quest before an unexpected visitor throws quite a spanner in their plan. At times this is little better than a derivative road movie. The characterisations are all just a bit too contrived, and the narrative is hardly original - but, that said, there is a quirkily spooky performance from Sir Mark - who looks like he would not be out of place half way up an Alp and Russell offers a reasonable effort as the conflicted and confused young woman trying to reconcile her innate desires with her aspirations as a woman. Chalamet presents us with one of his more natural and charismatic performances here, even if - shirtless for much of it as he is - he still makes me want to force feed him a bowl of fries (indeed the title could have been applied just to him!) Lots of dialogue, too much really, but the story has layers of complexity to it surrounding issues of identity and purpose - especially amongst the American young, some fine photography and it plays the accruing sense of affection between the youngsters without cringing sentimentality before an ending that seemed a little unnecessarily brutal. I suspect this may get better with another viewing.",2022-11-26T07:42:06.241Z,7.0,Bones and All,2022

Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross' score shines and is the work's greatest chance of receiving an Oscar nomination, taking into account the shocking approach to cannibalism - it partially affects the connection with the protagonists - and horror aspects.

I'd totally recommend <em>'Bones and All'</em>. I found plenty of enjoyment across the just over 2hr run time, despite plenty of unsettling moments scattered in there. I personally found the first half stronger than what follows it, though all in all it's a movie I had a positive time with.

Taylor Russell and Timothée Chalamet, two actors who give impressive showings in this 2022 production. Russell kinda outshines Chalamet in parts, but the latter does come up trumps with some strong emotion near the end. One thing's certain though: Mark Rylance is the star of the show, for my money at least. What a performance, loved every second of him being onscreen. Simply the perfect actor for the role of Sully!

A well made film, props to 'em for sticking with the creepiness of the story too. I mentioned recently after watching <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/saltburn/"" rel=""nofollow"">Saltburn</a>'</em> that I was disturbed.

49018,John Chard,"Tiptoe Through the Tulips.

Insidious is directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell. It stars Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Ty Simpkins, Barbara Hershey, Lin Shaye, Andrew Astor and Leigh Whannell. Music is scored by Joseph Bishara and cinematography by John R. Leonetti.

The team behind ""Saw"" and ""Dead Silence"" bring us ""Insidious"", one of the finest exponents of the haunted house movie in the modern era. Of course that doesn't count for much with those not particularly struck by the formula, but it does seem to be one of the very few horror sub-genre movies to come out with better than average appraisals.

Of course it's not perfect, few films, especially in horror world, can stand up and come through unscathed by critics and fans alike, yet for the like minded adults who can set the mood and channel themselves into the boo jump and creepy atmosphere world wrung out by Wan and Whannell, then this is the bomb.

Much has been made of the shift in the last third, where the film brings in Astral Projection as its reasoning for the pant soiling previously unleashed. Undeniably the film runs away with itself, goes too far and the last 15 minutes are a chaotic mess of bold ideas and inadequate staging. However, it's interesting to note how often the haunted house movie in recent times gets accused of not bringing something new to the table, something thrown at the wonderful ""Woman in Black"" that followed ""Insidious""down the pipe. Here the makers offer up something different, true, it hasn't worked in the way they or the hardened genre fans would have liked, but personally I found on second viewing it is forgivable. It's like riding your favourite Big Dipper, you enjoy the spins and upside down scream moments, but just tolerate the flat standard drive stretches of track while your heart tries to steady its beat.

When ""Insidious"" is hitting its heights it's utterly thrilling and unnerving, paced to perfection, it builds from whispered voices on a baby monitor to entities invading the home of the poor Lambert family. The mystery element is strong, just what do they want? Why is son Dalton in a coma but the medical boffins have no idea why? How come the entities have followed the Lambert's even when they move house? The latter of which is refreshing to see in the screenplay, it's a logical move but so often it's not done in other horror movies. The jumps are nicely placed throughout and a number of scenes are so freaky they get under your skin and stay there for some time - seriously, I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" again without my blood being chilled. The use of photographs and mirrors bring the goose flesh to the skin, while Lin Shaye's arrival as the paranormal physic, and the subsequent use of a gas mask, keep things ticking on the freaky deaky scale (though once the gas mask scene hits it's where the pic slightly falls away).

It borrows ideas and takes its tonal cues from other horror movies, definitely, and the second half doesn't live up to the promise of the first; hell I'll even concede that a certain entity is badly designed, but it does have something new to offer the formula, it's also well performed by the cast, that itself is a rarity. It hasn't resonated with all, but it was a monster hit at the box office, making nearly $85 million in profit. The market for a good haunted house spooker is always open, so Insidious, in spite of its second half irks, sits in the top draw with the best of them. 8/10",2019-11-01T00:01:44.111Z,8.0,Insidious I,2010
270303,Reno,"> An innovative horror-drama with a simplicity.

It was not too long ago I saw the director's other film, his first one and liked it instantly. I did not expect him to go all the way from a beautiful teen drama to a creepy horror flick. But I liked this movie as well, thus that prove he's not a fluke. After seeing his both the films, I can detect the style of presentation that marks his trademark. That is very realistic, dull, but a natural societal atmosphere with a mere background score.

I have said many times that these days horror flicks are heavily leaning on the scary noise/sounds. But this film brings the tone that's really happening around us. The story was like a straight flowing river, no twists or turns like the Amazon river. Even it did not try to hide the existence of the evil spirit. Not only from us, but among the characters in the story. That means it is a very simple tale with the compelling scenes.

It does not look like a cheap horror, this 2 million movie can stand up to any fancy horror flicks. The writer/director's interpretation was very interesting too. Like he said IT could board a plane to follow who he's after. The theme was also very innovative. Quite similar types have made out, but this one was way better. Yep, many movie goers overwhelmed by the unexpected, even the filmmakers for the response.

Now I pray for if there is going to be a sequel, it must be made by the same writer/director. My worry is the B category filmmakers going to spoil the original in the name of follow-up. I highly recommend this movie, especially for adults due to the plot that develops on the sexual intercourse. Though there's no strong nudity. I also suggest you to watch at night, if possible alone. I won't guarantee that it would scare out of you, but that's the best way to watch any horror flick.

The premise is certainly interesting and it does create suitable tension, while the effects used are neat. The plot is quite sexual, potentially overly so in a couple of moments but in truth it needs to be for the most part. I would've, elsewhere, appreciated a deeper dive into the antagonists, also.

Ok, ok, ok. I know the synopsis of this movie sounds like a lame excuse to focus on the sexual escapades of young college students, as many horror movies do. Instead, It Follows is surprisingly creative, well-done, and fresh that doesn't linger on the sensual but instead almost warns of potential consequences. The premise of a slow but relentless entity endlessly pursuing its cursed target is eerie, tense, and filled with suspense. Typical horror films repeat the same face-paced terror and disturbing gore and images. However, It Follows sets itself apart with a slow-building tension that keeps its audience unsettled but engaged, wondering what will happen next. This movie deserves all its hype with its innovative concept, clever script, and genius directing. While it does have unnecessary random nudity near the end, It Follows is worth fast-forwarding a few seconds to enjoy a creepy masterstroke of slow-burn horror.",2022-10-28T19:37:13.052Z,7.0,It Follows,2014
270303,Ahmad,"The exceptional cinematography contributes to its distinctive atmosphere and is unquestionably the finest element of the “It Follows”. Exploiting the idea of impending doom to terrify the viewer rather than depending on a monster or jump scare is a refreshing change.

Nevertheless, the premise was rather uninteresting, and the acting, although adequate, failed to leave an impression. Moreover, a ludicrous climax causes “It Follows” to lose focus, resulting in an underwhelming conclusion. Although enjoyable, the film falls well short of the high expectations set by its critical acclaim.

It has a lot of pictures and camera settings. The individual scenes are told leisurely and you take time for each individual setting.

Alex Garland also understands how to set the special effects to the perfect scene. The effects are very colorful and you can also notice how he is charging the tension. The creatures are very beautiful, although you know that in the next scene you can't trust the beauty. The meaning of life is also a message from Garland. Where we come from and where we go. Unfortunately, Garland sometimes delays the story too much and then waits in vain until Garland comes to the point. Also the actresses are very well selected and you notice that each of the women have a heavy backpack to wear.

The team gathered of multiple field experts to investigate this event was reminiscent of The Arrival and was fascinating. I found that there were certain plot points that were a little far-fetched, i.e. Lena being added to the team and being given classified shortly after arriving to the military base. There were certain scenes that had so much tension and were done with some pretty interesting creatures that had me on the edge of my seat.

NO SPOILERS – SheBlogger hates spoilers :)

 

Okay…so here’s another horror movie review from the girl who is yet to be scared with scenes shot in the dark, gory murders and startling sound effects.

 

HeBlogger and I went to the mall last Sunday to watch a different movie.  We thought Tiktik, which is a Filipino horror movie, was already showing.  Apparently, it is not scheduled until next week.  Then we saw Sinister’s poster, which said, “from the producer of Paranormal and Insidious”.  We have seen both movies and we both didn’t like Paranormal but both enjoyed Insidious. So we said, okay…let’s watch this instead.

Didn’t know anything about this movie Sinister so as we walked inside the empty movie house, I wondered which one is it going to be like. Is it going to be a homemade movie about paranormal activities with three different endings? Oh please…I fervently hope not! I crossed my fingers because I noticed there were rolls of super 8 films on the poster. Or is it going to be about demons capturing souls and possessing the physical body with a non-happy ending? Or is it going to be a totally different story?  I hoped it would be.

We were the first two of the five people who came to watch this movie.  The others were a group of three teenage girls, who surprisingly didn’t scream or shout at all, throughout the screening.  What a joy to be watching in silence and absolute peace!

Okay, on to the movie review…

The movie opens with a scene shot like a home video, so I go like, uh-oh… But don’t be disheartened. It’s nothing like Paranormal and deeper into the story, you’d see that it is more like Insidious. That much I would tell you.

The story is about a real crime stories writer, played by Ethan Hawke (the only actor I know in the movie), who moved his entire family to a house where a family was hung to death in the backyard tree and their little girl still missing.  In the course of his research and with the help of rolls of seemingly innocent and happy family home videos that mysteriously appeared in the attic, he discovers more brutal murders of different families in different houses. So there’s the question… Are these murders in any way related, considering there’s always a little child missing?

I must say that I find the premise of the story original. Well, at least for me. So I give it 4.5 gems for Story and Originality...

82507,John Chard,"Bughuul the Bastard!

After moving himself and his family into a new house that was the scene of a horrendous crime, true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) finds a box of 8mm ""snuff"" films that suggest the murder he is currently researching is the work of a serial killer whose career dates some way back still further...

It is becoming the un-reviewable genre, horror that is, there are just too many splinters of horror to choose from and so many people to cater for. There are many who stand up and proudly proclaim that they will watch any horror film and view it on its own terms, yet in this new millennium age that doesn't appear to be the case. I know I'm at fault, I hate torture porn and excessive grue type films, they just bore me, so can I review Hostel 9, Saw 27 and Wrong Turn 12 fairly? No, I don't think I can. I mean the human body can only be sliced up in so many different ways, right? Right? Vice Versa, can someone who loves Argento, Roth and the like, review fairly a boo-jump ghost story that caters for those who want to wet themselves when something jumps out of a cupboard? I really don't think so, but I digress...

Sinister is a wonderfully creepy movie that deals firmly in the realm of demons who come into the real world to cause unmitigating terror and heartbreak. It has no ""axe"" to grind with the blood thirsty who want to see arteries sliced and diced, it just wants to put a protagonist front and centre as he gets in way above his head, have his family come under serious threat; especially the child (oh my, the children...), and throw in the odd ""boo-jump"" moment to keep the pant wetters happy. The video footage used to show us the previous crimes unnerves greatly and there's a strong mystery element to keep the intrigue level high, whilst the ending doesn't cop out in the slightest. Hawke is excellent, perfectly portraying a man horrified yet submerged by the need to unravel the story, but his turn is sadly balanced by Juliet Rylance as the wife who seems unable to generate believable emotion.

This film really isn't for any horror fan who isn't into the ""demon in the real world"" type horror; like Insidious for example. While those who like this splinter of horror and still decry it brings nothing new to the table, I'll ask again, well what would you like to see brought to the table then? I love this sub-genre of horror, and I feel Sinister is one of the best films of its type in recent years.

398173,LachieD,"Another film by Lars von Trier done very much in the flavor of his previous picture, Nymphomaniac. It is, in my opinion, much less uneven and messy, but still too undisciplined to feel fully realized and satisfying. It ranges from brilliant to dubious constantly, while Nymphomaniac, despite also containing brilliant segments, sinks to cringe-worthy more than once.

Similarly to Nymphomaniac, where our main character is exploring a central part of her personality, in the case of that film her sexuality, by confessing her history to another character, all intertwined with commentary from philosophy and religion, here it's a murderer confessing the central part of his personality, his killer nature, to another character, all again mixed with dialogues on philosophy, art, etc. So in the style and approach the films are quite similar. Maybe even more that I would prefer, because Nymphomaniac didn't rub well off me, as the premise took precedence over proper story development.

The story in The House That Jack Built again is told in episodic manner, here even more so with the narrative being split into separate ""incidents"", and it often feels too artificial, staged, and improbable. I'm not sure how much this was premeditated and intentional. As I already mentioned, it feels too often quite implausible and ridiculous. It makes you question director's true intentions with this approach. Is he toying with the nature of the film medium, with audience expectations, or is simply using this narrative instrument to make a statement on art and (his own) filmmaking? It's hard to say. The approach however, has a quite potent result, which is in my opinion accidental. It tapped on that feeling of reality being stranger than fiction, and that impression of life being utterly indifferent to people doing evil things. But how the movie was executed, it makes you feel that this aspect of the film was a mere accident of the director's approach, and not a fully realized vision. As previously noted, the script veers into absurd one too many times for this sense of reality being stranger than fiction to have a chance to establish a footing, or simply, too feel convincing and compelling. As maybe it should have been. From the technical standpoint, I've found the usage of shaky cam very innapropriate for the story being potrayed and rather detrimental to the enjoyability of the film. But missed opportunities in the script feel more jarring to me, to be terribly bothered with this specific directorial choice.

It is definitely a more satisfying film than Nymphomaniac, but again feels too sketchy, too undisciplined, it's hard to embrace it. Despite being a fan of self-referential, meta filmmaking, I think this specific approach does this film a disservice. A more subtle, distanced angle, would do this story, keeping the same structure, wonders. It just so obvious that von Trier has the chops for a much more compelling film. You can sense is so many times during the course of this film, that you feel frustrated witnessing how he opts for another direction repeatedly.

Lars von Trier is a marvelous director, a talented visionary willing to tap into uncharted territories, and because of his prestige he is able to secure solid budgets for his film projects, as well as A listers probably doing the work for a discount, just to be in a Lars von Trier film. In that sense, his every new project is an exciting event for any film buff. But after these last two endeavors, I'm personally starting to lose interest. I'm simply convinced that discipline is important in art, and von Trier, at the current stage of his artistic career, chooses to blatantly disregard it, with weak results.

- Lars von Trier; ""Lars von Trier: 'I know how to kill'"" (David Jenkins); _Little White Lies_ (December 13, 2018)

Ostensibly a psychological horror/serial killer film, in reality the latest from professional provocateur Lars von Trier is more a dark comedy about the nature of art, capped off with a quite literal descent into Hell. As much an interrogation of his own dark psychology as an ""up yours"" to his detractors and the oft-levelled accusations of misogyny and nihilism, von Trier all but _dares_ you to be offended, whether by the violence done to a duckling, the cold-blooded murder of children, the verbal degradation of a woman, the critique of the #MeToo movement, the celebration of Albert Speer, or the mockery of American gun culture. Partially self-reflexive in nature, the film suggests a parallel between murder and artistic creation, with von Trier offering more of an _apologia_ than an apology for his oeuvre. When he's really on his game - _Breaking the Waves_ (1996), _Dancer in the Dark_ (2000), _Dogville_ (2003), _Antichrist_ (2009), _Melancholia_ (2011) - von Trier is capable of depicting horrific violence alongside psychologically complex characters and scenes of devastating emotional veracity. _House_, which is far too long and tends towards self-indulgence, doesn't come anywhere near those heights, and is thus more open to accusations of empty provocation, but von Trier has definitely tapped into ""something"" here, and, love it or hate it, you _will_ react to it.

As the film begins, we hear (but don't see) a conversation between Jack (an emotionless Matt Dillon) and ""Verge"" (the always superb Bruno Ganz) as Jack attempts to defend and justify his serial killing. Choosing to discuss five random but illustrative ""incidents"" over a period of twelve years during the 70s and 80s, the subsequent film is divided into six sections (""1st Incident"", ""2nd Incident"" etc., and ""Epilogue: Katabasis""). A wannabe architect whose mother forced him to be an engineer, Jack, who suffers from OCD, contends that his murders are literal works of art, and has given himself the moniker ""Mr Sophistication"". And short of describing each incident, that's about it as far as plot is concerned, although it certainly wouldn't hurt to be at least partially familiar with the work of William Blake and the _Inferno_ book of Dante Alighieri's _Divina Commedia_ (1320).

_The House That Jack Built_ was originally developed as a TV miniseries by von Trier and Jenle Hallund, who has a ""Story By"" credit on the final film. Premièring out of competition at Cannes 2018, it was the first time von Trier had been to the festival since receiving a ""lifetime"" ban in 2011 for making ill-judged comments about sympathising with Hitler. Not that he is saying sorry, of course; how could he be when the film extols the work of Albert Speer, and lauds the design perfection of the Stuka dive bomber. The first film in Cannes history to feature a warning on the tickets (for ""_scènes violentes_""), at the much-publicised première, over one-hundred people walked out, although those that stayed gave it a ten-minute standing ovation. This kind of extreme polarisation has continued ever since; _House_ is one of those rare films whose Metacritic scores range from zero (Jessica Kiang's hilarious rant for _The Playlist_) to 100 (Michael Roffman's review for _Consequence of Sound_). Particularly galling to some viewers has been the scene where a young Jack (Emil Tholstrup) cuts off a duckling's leg, places it back into the pond from which he took it, and watches it drown. PETA, however, defended the film, praising the fact that it draws attention to the link between adolescent animal abuse and adult psychopathy, and for the realistic special effects (which, it has to be said, are flawless – like many viewers, I thought the scene had been shot for real).

To begin parsing the film, one first needs to look at the character of Jack himself, specifically his lack of emotional interiority. Call it sociopathy, call it an inability to empathise, whilst there's definitely an intellectual core (seen in the many digressions he and Verge take concerning art and the nature of the artist), Jack is emotionally dead. Although we see him practising various emotional states in the mirror, he does this so as not to stand out when in the company of others, and the only _real_ emotions we ever see from him are irritation and anger, and even they are rare. Irritation is confined mainly to the 1st Incident, where he gives a lift to a woman whose car has broken down (Uma Thurman), and gradually gets more and more vexed as she goads him – telling him he looks like a serial killer but is obviously way too much of a ""_wimp_"" to ever actually kill anyone. Anger is mainly seen in the 5th Incident, when, right as he is about to murder a group of men tied up in the industrial freezer he uses to store bodies, he realises he has been sold hollow-point bullets instead of full metal jackets, prompting an infuriated trip to the gun store and a hilarious berating of the owner, Al (Jeremy Davies).

However, the running joke with Jack is not his emotional barrenness; it's his utter banality (the ""_banality of evil_"" personified). A frustrated architect, he's convinced that if he hadn't been forced to study engineering he could have been another Antoni Gaudí, Albert Speer, or Frank Lloyd Wright. In reality, however, he proves incapable of designing and building even a modest house – his grand artistic ambitions undermined by his limited abilities. Indeed, his delusions of grandeur are such that he sees himself of the same ilk as people such as Shakespeare, Mozart, Blake, and, especially, Glenn Gould. In contrast to these heightened artistic aspirations, especially in the early stages of the film, his actions are often those of a bumbling neurotic. Interestingly, however, the more he kills, the less his OCD bothers him; essentially, the more pain he inflicts on the world, the less in pain he feels.
Specifically on this point, it's impossible to ignore the parallels between Jack and von Trier himself. Von Trier, who suffers from depression and has battled alcoholism, has said in the past that his films are a kind of therapy, an attempt to work out his own inner demons. In this sense, the more films depicting pain and torment that he makes, the less in pain he feels. It's definitely a superficial reading of the character, who is clearly not a 1:1 surrogate for the director, but it's hard to deny the analogy of how Jack feels the need to one-up himself with each murder, becoming more and more sadistic as he goes. This, of course, has become a very common criticism of von Trier's filmography. He has also been accused of misogyny and of exploiting the psychological (and often physical) suffering of his actors, just as Jack is obviously a misogynist who exploits the suffering of his victims. And this isn't subtext. Rather, von Trier himself makes the connection explicit when a discussion of genocide and tyranny features a montage of scenes from his own filmography; _Forbrydelsens element_ (1984), _Medea_ (1988), _Riget_ (1994), _Breaking the Waves_ (1996), _Dogville_ (2003), _Antichrist_ (2009), _Melancholia_ (2011), and _Nymph()maniac: Vol II_ (2013). There's even an element of self-flagellation about the whole thing, with Verge positing that ""_hubris must be punished by Nemesis_"" – are the criticisms von Trier has faced the Nemesis punishing his hubris?

Thematically, according to von Trier, the film

> _celebrates the idea that life is evil and soulless, which is sadly proven by the recent rise of the Homo trumpus – the rat king._

Yep, that's a reference to Donald Trump. As with _Nymph()maniac_, the film is structured around a conversation between two people, with frequent digressions to topics often fairly tangential to the main narrative. So whilst _Nymph()maniac_ gave us treaties on fly-fishing, parallel parking, and the Fibonacci sequence, _House_ features discussions concerning viticulture, the oak tree in Buchenwald, cathedral architecture, photo negatives, and the dichotomy of predator and prey, via a rather simplistic comparative analysis of Blake's ""The Lamb"" (1776) and ""The Tyger"" (1794). One especially interesting digression, and perhaps the most obvious instance of von Trier biting his thumb at his accusers is a monologue where Jack laments the fact that men are the _de facto_ villains of every situation. Being set in the 70s and 80s, there's obviously no specific mention of #MeToo, but it's obvious where the invective is aimed. Coming across like a slightly more unhinged Jordan Peterson, Jack has no time for debates concerning gender fluidity or sexual misconduct, even going so far as to suggest that women are more cooperative murder victims because they're ""_easier to work with_."" You can all-but hear Rose McGowan blowing a gasket!

Aside from the aforementioned duckling scene, by far the most disturbing scene is the 4th Incident. Here, we are introduced to Jacqueline (an excellent Riley Keough), whom Jack has been dating for a while. What is most distressing about the scene is not how Jack kills her (although it's far and away the most graphic death in the film), but what precedes her murder. After making an incredibly kind and thoughtful gesture, Jack then proceeds to mercilessly verbally belittle her, calling her by the nickname he has given her, ""Simple"", because he believes she is so unintelligent. He then takes great delight in revealing to her that he is Mr Sophistication, enjoying her discomfit as she tries to decide whether or not he's telling the truth. The cumulative effect of the psychological torment is unsettling, to say the least, and when she does finally realise that he is not lying about being a killer, he revels in suggesting that she scream; the futility of which he demonstrates by shouting out an open window, ""_no one will help you_."" It's a devastating scene, far more emotionally upsetting than it is physically violent, and because of that, it's one of the best scenes in the film, provoking a genuine emotional response in the viewer beyond mere disgust.

As unsettling as this scene is, the film can also be extremely funny, with the entire 2nd Incident playing out like an extended _Key and Peele_ sketch. Trying to gain entry to a woman's (Siobhan Fallon Hogan) house, Jack does a hilariously bad impression of a policeman, explaining, ""_I don't have my badge with me because I'm getting a promotion_"", and then cheerfully waving to a passing driver as if they are best friends. Once inside, he only manages to kill his victim at the third attempt, and then, having left the house, his OCD compels him to return three times to check for blood splatters in such places as behind a picture on the wall and under the leg of a chair. Finally, to get away from the cops that have shown up, he ties the body to the back of his van, pulling it along the road, and leaving a blood trail from the house to his industrial freezer, only for it to start raining and erase the blood.

From an aesthetic point of view, Von Trier and regular cinematographer Manuel Alberto Claro shoot _House_ in a cinéma vérité style; almost the entire film is handheld, with the immediacy further enhanced by having the focus occasionally drift in and out, creating a scaled-back naturalistic look somewhat reminiscent of John McNaughton's _Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer_ (1986). The interesting thing about shooting it this way, however, is that the pseudo-documentarian visual approach clashes with the narrative and thematic concerns, which more closely resemble Mary Harron's _American Psycho_ (2000); both films are focused on unreliable narrators, both feature scenes in which the killers try to confess their crimes and are ignored, and both tell stories that may very well be taking place only in the demented mind of the central character. In a general aesthetic sense, the film ends on a very strong note as Jack and Verge descend to hell (""Katabasis"" is the Ancient Greek word for ""descent""). This incredible sequence starts with a stunning repurposing of Eugène Delacroix's _La Barque de Dante_ (1822), and culminates in a Hell that's equal parts Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and Zdzisław Beksiński.

However, the film is far from perfect. For starters, it can be incredibly self-indulgent. Von Trier's name, for example, appears on the title card, not in the sense of ""A Lars von Trier film"", but just his name, as one would expect to see of a major actor. The film is also unnecessarily long, and there are stretches which are extremely tedious, a problem which also afflicted _Nymph()maniac_, particularly _Volume II_. I'm also not sure that a clip reel of his own films was the wisest choice. Additionally, the female characters are, by the very nature of the film, essentially empty shells who exist only to be murdered. We may feel a degree of sympathy for them (especially Sofie Gråbøl in the 3rd Incident), but only Jacqueline has any degree of psychological verisimilitude. Some of the digressions concerning art and its relationship to love and hate are also (perhaps intentionally) juvenile and intellectually vapid.

Whilst it could be argued that _House_ is about a desensitised world indifferent to suffering, it seems to be more about Lars von Trier and the criticisms that have been levelled against him over the years. Although he doesn't seem willing to apologise for anything, he is more than happy to defend, attempting to use the depiction of violence so as to facilitate introspection, reflecting on the importance (or lack thereof) of morality and culpability in artistic creation. Does he point the finger at an indifferent and often culpable audience yearning for blood, such as Michael Haneke does in _Funny Games_ (1997)? Is he using violent extremes to criticise societal oppression and exploitation, such as Pier Paolo Pasolini does in _Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma_ (1975)? Is he simply mocking the contemporary craze for thrill-kill films and TV shows? The answer to each is perhaps. _House_ is an especially self-reflexive and somewhat self-disdainful film, which Von Trier has intimated may be his last. If that is so, it certainly makes for a fittingly provocative and confrontational final word.",2019-07-05T00:15:44.138Z,7.0,The House That Jack Built,2018
242224,John Chard,"Ba Ba-Ba Dook! Dook! Dook!

The Babadook is written and directed by Jennifer Kent. It stars Essie Davis, Noah Wiseman, Daniel Henshall and Hayley McElhinney. Music is by Jed Kurzel and cinematography by Radek Ladczuk.

Amelia is a single mother still haunted by the violent death of her husband, she is trying to deal with her young son Samuel's fear of a monster in the house. Initially tolerating it as a flight of fancy, the arrival of a book in the youngster's bedroom called Mr. Babadook, signals the start of a sinister presence that she herself can begin to fear as well.

Australia has been producing some great horror films in the last couple of decades, The Babadook is one of the best of the bunch. Jennifer Kent made it as a 10 minute short back in 2005 called Monster, itself a super piece of horror film making, now in full feature length form (Kent’s first), the vision and intelligence explodes off the screen in every frame.

The premise at the core is not exactly fresh, but Kent manages to make The Babadook its own entity, skilfully steering away from formula jolts and terrors. Which in this day and age of horror retreads, sequel frenzies and blood for blood’s sake, is most refreshing. This is a big character piece, a two hander of incredible emotional power, a mother and son dealing with their own demons before the eponymous Babadook enters the fray. We care about this pair of troubled souls, so much so that as we start to feel the dread, get the tingles down the spine, our hearts are also aching for them. The two performances of the actors quite simply magnificent.

Mr. Babadook is a pop-up picture book that suddenly arrives into their lives. The creature  is a sort of cross between a German expressionistic nightmare and Jack the Ripper. The book itself is creepy enough in its own right, more so as it starts to take on a more terrifying tone – and Amelia proves unsuccessful at getting rid of the thing – the picture starts playing its ace psychological cards. The monster is kept mostly to the edges of the frames, or just popping up for a quick glance in unexpected places, this is a great move and suits the narrative perfectly.

The tech credits are top notch. A key aspect to getting the most out of The Babadook is to make sure the sound is loud, for the sound mix is tremendous and can bring pounds of gooseflesh rising up on your arms. Ladczuk’s photography is at one with the themes pulsing away in the story, the colours paled and cheerless, enhancing the fractured psyches of mother and son, but Mr. Babadook is a jet black presence in this landscape. All told the art design from the book to the house and the creature is excellent.

Umbrella’s Australian All Region Blu-ray Release has a super transfer and does justice to the sound mix. There’s over an hour of interviews, which are a mixed bag of informative chat and back slapping, a 12 minute behind the scenes making of and some trailers. The bonus is the 10 minute short, Monster, The Babadook in its infancy but no less scary for it.

The Babadook is a superlative horror film for adults, like when Polanski met Kubrick and they decided to pay homage to Fritz Lang and George Melies. Yes it’s that good. 10/10",2014-11-19T23:18:48.541Z,10.0,The Babadook,2014

I would've liked more from the monster and how it works, though the film does give you enough and certainly does a fine job at building up the atmosphere of uneasiness that the thing produces. One great part I noticed is the sound editing, which is astutely crafted throughout.

Essie Davis does terrific in the role of Amelia, she shows every emotion that her character is feeling nicely - I felt her pain initially with the kid, too. Noah Wiseman plays her son, Samuel. He is actually quite impressive given his age, there are a few scenes where he adds a fair deal to them.

242224,MovieGuys,"The Babadook is one of those elusive horror films, that's open to broad interpretation. 

My personal feeling have watched the whole film in the context of the single mothers predicament, is the real monster is the spectre of domestic abuse. Abuse that happens when a fundamentally decent person, is pushed too far by life and circumstance. 

I will warn you, this film is most definitely not for everyone. If, like me, you don't like films, that emulate the abuse of animals, you might want to give this one a hard pass.

That said, there is a lot to like in The Babadook. Its a grimly realistic insight into how life's tragedies can compound and grow, beyond the first tragic event. 

Acting too, as is so, so often the case with Australian films, is of a very high standard. Its easy to be drawn into the unfolding, sad tale of a struggling mother, who suddenly finds herself single, sad and alone, with a young son to support. 

In summary, quite brilliant, in a dark, at times sad and depressing way. By no means an easy watch but certainly a haunting one, that will remain with you, long after the closing credits.",2024-02-18T04:52:55.033Z,7.0,The Babadook,2014

And this is something different. Actually, no films are different these days, but it has succeeded to shape differently with an already known platform. Except the small parts of the opening and the ending, the rest of the story takes place in a postmortem room and its building. It is a one night story and revolves around two characters, a coroner father and his assistant son. After receiving an unidentified body to examine, the son decides to stay back with his dad by dropping out the plan to go a date with his girlfriend. As the procedure begins, the night goes on. But at the half way through, they begin to experience the strange events. And once it goes beyond their hands, they try to survive the threads that come their way which pretty much the rest of the film.

A short and sweet horror. I mean no sweet, but very effective theme. There are lots of things you won't understand, even the film does not explain them for us. But if you sit back and think about them after you have watched it, you would get many perspectives, like about the corpse, and what happened at the end. I could have revealed mine in here, but it would only spoil your watch if you are yet to see it. Overall, there's nothing serious you are going to miss any details. Except one question that nobody sure about is who is/was Jane Doe, I mean her background story that linked to this film event. Only a prequel would explain that. So I hope they make one quickly. Meantime, don't miss it if you're looking for a decent horror film. Because it's much better that any recent horrors.

The Autopsy of Jane Doe starts strong with a mysterious corpse and two coroners who find themselves in greater danger with each clue they uncover to the death of this disturbing body. The first half of the film is fantastic. The tension builds with each passing second. Every new bit of information the characters discover cranks up the anxiety and horror. As the answers become more apparent and more terrifying, so does the fate of the coroners. But once the terror finally begins, the film falls flat. Nothing really happens. Mostly a lot of panic and implied danger, but not a lot is actually shown. What is shown is slightly below average for the typical supernatural horror film.

82654,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is a quite different zombie movie. I think it can best be described as a romantic zombie movie with a humorous touch and some action thrown in for good measure. It is not at all a bad movie. I do prefer the “shot everything that moves and when it doesn’t move anymore shot some more just to be sure” type of zombie movies but I still quite enjoyed this one. The words “romantic” and “zombie” is of course two words that you really would never expect to see in the same sentence. Surprisingly enough it does indeed work in this movie.

I think my main enjoyment of this movie was the voice-over with R’s thoughts though. At times it is incredibly funny. The actual story, that the zombies’ magically starts to heal themselves is of course pretty nonsensical but you do not really watch zombie movies for their elaborate plot anyway. I have seen worse and this was not really supposed to be a horror-zombie movie anyway so I can live with that.

This is the first zombie-movie that I have watched where you actually see the story from the zombies perspective. Another thing that, surprisingly enough, worked quite well. The voice-overs helped a lot to make that happen.

The special effects are fairly low key for being a zombie movie but I would say that they are just about right for this movie. The “bonies” are the most monster-like ones in the movie and their make-up is quite cool. Unfortunately their movements are quite stiff and look decidedly computer generated. That is a shame and pretty much the only complaint I have concerning the actual implementation of this movie.

1408 is based on one of horror writer Stephen King's short stories. It stars John Cusack as a supernatural investigator who rents room 1408 at The Hotel Dolphin in New York. It is said to be a most haunted room and the scene of many deaths. He soon finds his scepticism tested to the max.

Although it has deep themes of grief et al, this essentially boils down to one man in a room being plagued by psychological and physical attacks, with the intended chills and shocks surreal in presentation. It's all very twisty and big on conundrums, which makes a second viewing something of a necessity, whilst Cusack's performance is also reason to check in for another viewing. However, it's not the scary movie some have lauded it as, in fact it's more fun-house palaver than anything terrifying, but there's no doubting the intelligence and skill of the writing. The mind is a curious, wonderful and troubling thing, and 1408 wants us to know it. 6/10",2017-03-10T03:18:10.471Z,6.0,1408,2007

3021,RalphRahal,"(Watched the Theatrical version)

1408 is a solid psychological horror that pulls you into its dark and twisted world. John Cusack does an amazing job as Mike Enslin, a skeptic writer dealing with supernatural horrors while battling his own guilt over losing his daughter. His performance really makes the movie—he sells the fear, grief, and madness perfectly.

That said, the endings are what really stood out for me. The theatrical version felt too neat and safe. Sure, it wraps things up nicely, but for a movie this dark, it needed something heavier. The director’s cut hit harder—it’s bleak and sticks with you. The haunting moment with his daughter fit the tone of the movie so much better. It kept the unsettling vibe that should linger after a film like this.

The production was great too. The way the room constantly changes and traps you with Mike was done so well, keeping you on edge the whole time. Overall, I enjoyed it, but the director’s cut is the real winner for me. It keeps the dark, disturbing feel that a movie like this needs.",2024-12-17T16:45:00.073Z,8.0,1408,2007
790,John Chard,"00:00: 21st April, 1980.

The Fog is directed by John Carpenter who also co-writes the screenplay with Debra Hill. It stars Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook, Jamie Lee Curtis and Nancy Loomis. Carpenter also scores the music and cinematography is by Dean Cundey.

The Californian fishing town of Antonio Bay is preparing to celebrate its 100 year anniversary. As the clock ticks past midnight strange events start to occur around the town, it seems that the town has a secret and that secret is back to make a point...

Not as praised as Halloween and The Thing from John Carpenter's early horror output, The Fog sees the director tackle the ghost story premise. For many who lapped it up back when the 80s began, it still enthrals and holds in its eerie vice like grip, for others in this desensitised age of gore and cgi overkill, it proves to be a film unable to justify the love poured on it by the fans. Which is a shame.

Being able to appreciate the craft of John Carpenter back in 1980 certainly helps to avert some harsh criticisms thrown its way, because Carpenter has achieved, pound for pound, a better ghost story on a fraction of the budget afforded big Hollywood genre productions that have been made since. That's not to say it's perfect, for it's not, Carpenter himself has never been wholly satisfied with the final film, this even after re-shooting a third of the film after originally making a picture reliant on suggestion over presence, but with some smoke machines, a synthesiser, a game cast and a spooky revenge story on the page, he's made a sub-genre classic.

Carpenter has somehow managed to blend old fashioned ghostly goings on within a modern setting, that of a fishing town that proves perfect once the sun goes down and the town tries to sleep. You can practically smell the salt in the sea, such is the knack of the director for setting the mood. Then with minimalistic panache, the director marries up fog with synth beats to create maximum dread, and then he teases, perfectly, by only letting us glimpse his ghosts as dark figurines, making us fill in the blanks as to what they look like, where armed with our imagination they prove to be more scary than some CGI enhanced entity created in the blockbuster age. The killings that follow carry a high gruesome factor, and we don't need (or get) buckets of blood for them to impact, and the suspense is jacked up so much in the final quarter it proves to be edge of the seat stuff as the spring finally uncoils.

Filmed in widescreen to give off a higher end production value, which works, Carpenter surrounds himself with familiar folk and inserts in jokes and homages that also keep the film grounded and a mile away from Hollywood excess. From character names to Hitchcock stars and references (Bodega Bay anyone?), the pic feels exactly what it is, a film made with love; Carpenter even cameos at the start of the film and it is a world away from the smugness of a Shyamalan. Yes there are problems, Curtis and Atkins are strangers who meet and in the blink of an eye they are in bed together, which looks to be a bad edit, while the gathering of principal characters in one place for the finale is a bit of a contrivance. Yet these are minor irritants, because The Fog is a film that once loved will always stay loved. In 78 Carpenter plotted the course for the slasher formula to follow, in 1980 he helped realign (see also Peter Medak's The Changeling) the good ship ghost story that was on rocky waters. Low budget creepy excellence. 9/10",2019-05-28T22:18:38.892Z,9.0,The Fog,1980
790,CinemaSerf,"A century after a ship sank losing all hands, an eery fog makes it's way along the coast towards the small town of Antonio Bay in California. The residents think nothing of this until a series of para-normal incidents start to occur and folks start to disappear. Could the mysterious fog have anything to do with these mishaps? A bit of investigation into the history of the town discovers that it was founded after an heinous crime committed by their predecessors on a passing ship, wrecked deliberately, that was carrying lepers - and gold. Could the fog be part of the retribution? Well it's soon down to Jamie Lee Curtis (""Solley""); Adrianne Barbeau (""Stevie"") and Janet Leigh (""Kathy"") to try to get to the bottom of things before the looming mist deposits it's own menacing cargo. The instantly recognisable opening tones from John Houseman's ""Dr. Machen"" set the scene well here for what is a gently accumulating horror film that leaves much of the sense of peril to our own nervousness, imagination and also offers the largely female cast an opportunity not just to run about screaming and wailing in the face of danger for a change. Darkness, fogginess, eeriness - lights flickering, cars not starting - the sense of isolation and loneliness. All of these fears are well capitalised upon by John Carpenter - not just with his use of the lighting and the camera, but also with his creation of a score that is also effective at heightening the tension. The acting is really only adequate, it has to be said - with Adrienne Barbeau struggling a bit, I felt - but unlike with many other Carpenter films, he stays focussed on the simplicity of the peril - the characters are given enough to say and do and the pace doesn't hang about for just shy of ninety minutes.

9871,Wuchak,"***Melancholy, foul (but amusing) werewolf flick in the suburbs of Toronto with Katharine Isabelle***

Two Goth-ish sisters in the burbs of Ontario are outcasts at their school and obsessed with death. Redhead Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is hot and blunt while Brigette (Emily Perkins) is mousey. When the former gets bit by an evident werewolf she slowly starts morphing and it changes the siblings’ lives forever. Kris Lemche and Jesse Moss are on hand as the dudes in the girls’ lives while Mimi Rogers plays the seemingly oblivious mother.

""Ginger Snaps"" (2000) takes place in the Fall and there’s a gloomy pall with constant F-bombs (mostly from Ginger), but an edge of black humor. The blithe mother, for instance, is amusing. There are similarities to “The Rage: Carrie 2” (1999), but it’s nowhere near as effective. The set-up is good, but the story starts to drag from there and the suburban locations are disagreeably one-dimensional. Katharine Isabelle is the sole feminine interest, but Perkins plays a somewhat interesting character. Meanwhile Lemche’s Sam is notable as the unexpectedly gallant pot-pusher.

The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in suburbs of Toronto (Brampton, Mississauga & Markham).

1946,John Chard,"Free will is obviously not a big factor in this little world of ours.

Hee, yet another David Cronenberg picture that divides opinions, not just among the casual film watchers, but also his most ardent fans.

Plot is a little nutty in actuality, as it finds Jennifer Jason Leigh as the world's most high profile games designer. While testing her new virtual reality game out with a focus group, an assassination attempt puts her on the run with an ally of sorts, marketing man Ted Pikul (Jude Law). With the prototype of the new game in their possession, the pair must enter the game's realm to unlock the various puzzles and threats that now confounds and stalks them.

With Cronenberg back to writing something solely from his own head, eXistenZ finds the Canadian auteur happy to be back making a truer piece of work for his kinked visions. Unfortunately the advent of such virtual reality fare and various realist themes was well in filmic swing come the time eXistenZ was released, rendering it in some eyes as a band wagon jumper. That's unfair, because it's still a unique film, as Cronenberg blends body horror with visual invention to create a mind warp of gaming possibilities, a thrum thrum of futuristic verve. He gets top performances out of Leigh (great hair as well) and Law, while the narrative is constantly tricky enough to demand the viewer pays attention whilst being prepared to, perhaps, be surprised.

Kevin McKidd keeps the troop focussed at they face their foes with grim determination and their black humour prevails pretty much throughout their ordeal.

10493,John Chard,"Stay calm and you may yet not end up dead.

Dead Calm is directed by Phillip Noyce and adapted to screenplay by Terry Hayes from the novel of the same name written by Charles Williams. It stars Sam Neill, Nicole Kidman and Billy Zane. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Dean Semler.

After losing their young son in a car accident, John (Neill) and Rae Ingram (Kidman) head out alone on their yacht for an ocean vacation. Whilst taking in some R&R, the couple spy a ship drifting in the distance, then a man in a dinghy hurriedly rows towards them. He boards their yacht, frantic and panicked, he tells them the ship is sinking and that all on board are dead, killed by food poisoning. His name is Hughie Warriner (Billy Zane), and the Ingram's are about to wish they had never met him....

The Saracen and The Orpheus.

It's so refreshing to find a thriller that works without tricks or elaborate plotting, where the narrative is stripped down to the bare bones and played out purely by three characters. Dead Calm, whilst not exactly the most credible of thrillers from the 80s, contains genuine suspense, a pot boiling heart and production value of some distinction. Director Noyce deals in psychological studies, primarily that of a lunatic and that of a woman beset with grief having to use her mental fortitude to hopefully save herself and her husband.

Noyce and his team get the maximum amount of edge of the seat thrills from a small isolated yacht in the middle of a vast ocean, with tight camera work and nifty editing, it's a film of quality that belies its pared back production. Even ace Aussie photographer Semler (previously Mad Max 2/Razorback, latterly Dances With Wolves/Waterworld) creates beauty out of such a sparse set up, where the blues and greens of the ocean warm the soul and the red sunsets please the eyes. They be glimpses of Mother Earth that give the Ingram's something tangible to fight for.

With the plot requiring Neill to be in his own isolated hell, he turns in a more measured performance, perfect in fact, but it's Zane and Kidman who steal the show. This would prove to be the launching point of Kidman's career, and it hints at the top actress she would become. She gives Rae Ingram a real strength through adversity, with energy in abundance, intelligence and a simmering sexuality, she's a lady character earning respect by film lovers because of Kidman's performance. Zane is suitably edgy, very much giving Hughie a man-child persona, he too exudes a dangerous sexuality, and when it inevitably kicks off, he is scary into the bargain.

A couple of daft character decisions within the story, and a WTF finale, stop it from being near the top of the thriller movie pantheon. But it's not far off from sitting with the best and it remains fresh and entertaining as the decades roll by. 8/10",2014-03-24T08:33:23.052Z,8.0,Dead Calm,1989

315011,Frank Ochieng,"One might nostalgically recall the days back when the cheesy yet infectious Japanese monster movies were such a magnificent draw during those hazy Saturday afternoons showcasing the double creature feature matinees that aired weekly on television. We were considered very lucky if we had Mothera battle Gamera in one showing followed up by experiencing the sheer thrill of watching Rodan take on his latest ferocious foe as well. However, as well-known as these mentioned Far East big screen beasts were in all their glorious rage and colorful destruction nobody was as legendary or instrumental in seriously wreaking havoc on vulnerable Japanese soil both heroically or horrendously than our heralded King of Carnage in the celebrated _Godzilla_. 

The famed and humongous rumble-and-tumble reptile makes a grand return courtesy of Toho Studios reviving the catastrophic critter in writer/co-director Hideaki Anno’s and Shinji Higuchi’s monster mash offering **Godzilla Resurgence** (a.k.a.”Shin Godzilla”). Interestingly, the last _Godzilla_ flick that was released by Toho Studios was more than a decade ago in 2004. Naturally, Japanese audiences were privileged to the exploitative antics of the favorable large lizard when **Godzilla Resurgence** premiered earlier this year.

Thankfully, Anno’s and Higuchi’s spry creature concoction is now showing up in limited release in other countries as _Godzilla_ dusts off his combative cobwebs from yesteryear and makes a contemporary return to the cinematic psyches for baby-boomers looking to revive their childhood memories of the spike-toothed rampaging rogue doing what he does best: stomping through the endangered streets of Japan in the name of high-wire popcorn entertainment. In any event, there is a willing welcome wagon to embrace this familiar and feisty monstrous menace with robust enjoyment. There have been previous _Godzilla_ editions that were not necessarily received with the pat-on-the-back reception (yes Roland Emmerich–we are referencing your disastrous take on 1998’s _Godzilla_). Still, **Godzilla Resurgence** accomplishes the impossible as it stays close to its humble 1954 roots while managing to sprinkle some fresh impishness within its clever manufactured mayhem.

The screening experience of viewing the majestic monster _Godzilla_ is stunning and surreal because the film’s handlers create the terrorizing tension and torture of a full-scale predator crashing his way into the miniature-sized obstacles (people, buildings, bridges, power lines, etc.) with demolished durability. The physical details on the _Godzilla_ monster are hideously wondrous and every bloody drool from the creature’s jagged mouth and ominous scaly skin is profoundly sinister. The thought of Godzilla’s two-ton tail pouncing and waving with destructive defiance generates the additional mystique of this Asia-based destroyer.

For those not quite informed about the backstory of the _Godzilla_ mythology it is quite simple: a classical creature was born/created back in 1954 at Toho Studios where filmmaker Ishiro Honda presented a monster flick that would go on to endure as a cult favorite in Japanese cinema and elsewhere around the world for the next six decades. Sure, the various _Godzilla_ installments (not including the derivative American versions) were saddled in inspired cheesiness (you got to love the laughable “man-in-the-monster-suit” cheapened special effects) with toy model sets serving as a deteriorating Japanese background to _Godzilla’s_ cinematic wrath. Nevertheless, the clear message was received thoughtfully and philosophically–_Godzilla_ and his creepy contemporaries was conceived and symbolic of that country’s disillusionment with its atomic bombing past. As a result, the Japanese-based beasts were reflective of the man-made devastation that haunted a targeted region of the world that knew annihilation and humiliation. _Godzilla_ made for some escapist thrills and chills for Japanese movie audiences in the heyday of the 50’s and 60’s but Honda’s alarming predatory pest would also resonate as a freakish catalyst for the country’s past and present turmoil for political, societal and technological survival. Hence, _Godzilla_ is a representative (and product) of a historical nuclear blast that remains as an immense ugly chapter in humanity.

**Godzilla Resurgence** (_Shin Godzilla_) introduces good ole Godzilla as a mystery wrecking machine unbeknownst to the Tokyo city officials that have no clue in how to contain the unknown boisterous, beastly intruder as he storms through Japan like a loose sledgehammer through a light bulb factory. Once the return of the ravenous Godzilla had been identified the big brass now has to figure out how to eradicate the enormous fiendish phenomenon. Do they nuke the corrosive creature without the dire consequences of sacrificing its jeopardized citizens in the territory?

As the Japanese government agonizes over what should be done with Godzilla’s dubious presence as he methodically smashes everything in his wicked path the cynicism grows moment by moment. Specifically, why is Godzilla’s tumultuous existence impacting their way of life? Is the creature’s overstayed welcome some sort of plot from the rest of the world to dump unrest and debauchery on their sacred grounds? Better yet can the foreign superpowers such as the United States, China or Russia collaborate to help terminate the mighty monster? Will Godzilla disturb global concerns and if so how will the militaristic mindset play out in Japan’s beleaguered backyard?

**Godzilla Resurgence** aims to be more than just a typical giant monster movie mired in splashy CGI special effects and engulfed explosions. Anno (“Evangelion”) and Higuchi (“Attack on Titan”) actually serve up a sophisticated and thought-provoking creature caper that digs underneath the throwaway exploitation surface. The tongue-in-cheek nostalgia is firmly maintained and the moviegoers are treated to their share of Godzilla’s manic mischievousness. Importantly, Anno and Higuchi amp up their brand of a disguised political potboiler in the form of a sci-fi monster B movie that sufficiently labors at mirroring the current-day chaos and conflicts that bombard a modern-day Japan (or any inserted nation for that matter). Whether spotlighting international trust/distrust or pinpointing kaiju (meaning “big, brutal monsters”) terrorism as an allegory for Japan’s temporary unseen but inevitable national fallout caused by an impenetrable nature disaster it is quite revealing that **Godzilla Resurgence** delves beyond its cartoonish ruination.

Whatever interpretation that one derives from **Godzilla Resurgence** the verdict is undeniably sound that Toho Studios delivers a lively and message-driven platform about uncontrollable forces and critical decisions that befall an ambivalent country undergoing in-house scrutiny. To put it in layman’s terms: **Godzilla Resurgence** is a surprisingly well-done despite its sometimes campy makeup. Surely **Resurgence** is solid enough to uphold the G-man’s beloved legacy in the kaiju genre.

A man (Art Hindle) investigates a pop psychologist’s unconventional therapy techniques after his daughter shows signs of abuse when visiting her mother (Samantha Eggar) undergoing the secretive treatments. The mystery deepens when people linked to the situation wind up slain by… the Brood. Oliver Reed plays the strange, formidable doctor.

“The Brood” (1979) is a psychological drama/horror written & directed by David Cronenberg after his divorce & custody battle, which makes sense once you see the movie. As my title blurb states, the theme concerns the personification of internal rage, whether conscious or subconscious, which wasn’t a new concept in 1978 when the film was made; think “Forbidden Planet” (1956). A couple issues of the Man-Thing comic also addressed the issue in 1974. To forge the script Cronenberg combined this element with the oft-used idea of nefarious offspring a la “Village of the Damned” (1960) and “Children of the Damned” (1964).

One highlight is Reed’s intense performance and understated, intimidating presence. He was one of Brando’s few contemporaries that matched his brooding magnetism. Another highlight is the setting of Toronto in the late winter (or early spring), particularly the awesome Somafree facility in the country. The realistic tone is good and the movie has the confidence to take its time, but some parts & dialogues are too slow, which tempts your mind to wander. Also, the movie scores poorly on the female front.     

The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Toronto & Mississauga, Ontario.

The Brood is written and directed by David Cronenberg. It stars Oliver Reed, Samantha Eggar and Art Hindle. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Mark Irwin.

Frank Carveth (Hindle) attempts to uncover the truth about  an unconventional psychologist's therapy techniques on his institutionalized wife. Could the treatments at the Somafree Institute have anything to do with the recent series of brutal murders?

Come 1979 one David Cronenberg was getting into his grove for laying down a marker for body horror and psychological distortion. The Brood is at its core a little ""too"" out there, but it is high on thought provoking worth and as we would come to expect from the great director, it's also in turns repulsive. Crucially, as is the director's want, it isn't spoon feeding you answers, the narrative gaps are deliberate, pic urges you to invest your all or get nothing in return.

Pace is very much on the slow burn, the story trundling along as we get to grips with the key characters - most importantly that of Nola Carveth (Eggar). Working with a par for the course tight budget, Cronenberg goes big on atmosphere and simmering tension (utilising his cinematography know how), stopping only briefly for some short sharp shockery as strange mutant children - maybe? - suddenly appear to unleash brutality. There's a cold and distant disquiet about proceedings, which ironically matches the settings for the play unfolding.

Interesting to note that not for the first or last time Cronenberg was accused of over stepping the mark. Recently off of a caustic divorce, he then made The Brood, which on the outside definitely does have anti woman leanings. To say more would be spoiler territory, so make up your own minds on that score, but either way it's the clinically unsettling work of an always challenging director. 7/10",2019-06-26T22:13:14.932Z,7.0,The Brood,1979

His techniques are either cutting edge or reckless, depending on your point of view - and his peers take the latter view, so he carries out much of his work in a remote facility that appears little better than a glorified cabin. When his young daughter returns from a visit to her mother, ""Frank"" notices some rather nasty bruises on her back. Concerned, he forbids his daughter from returning, but when firstly his mother, then his father are brutally killed by being beaten to death, he begins to suspect all is not right with ""Raglan"" and his practices. Now, we are given clues far earlier than ""Frank"", so I found there to be little jeopardy with the developing plot. David Cronenberg's story, here, is not one of his more complex, or finest for the matter and the ending made me laugh. It isn't that it is nonsense, it's just that it lacks any sense of peril or horror. The Howard Shore score tries hard to create a sense of fear, but we all know (or can easily guess) too much, too early in the proceedings for it to really build-up a head of steam, with the effects - especially at the end being more comical than terrifying. Much more could have been made of the meta-physics themes that underpinned the story, but as it is - it's just a bit half-baked.",2023-06-05T19:35:29.841Z,6.0,The Brood,1979

It was a compromised production, with director Tom Savini announcing that the finished cut is not half the film he set out to make. Surprising, then, to find it still works to the point of being viable. It's a very effective zombie pic, one performed with quality by the cast, with the concept of a group of people holed up in a house - under intense attack by the walking dead - still terrifying. It helps to cast Tony Todd in a reimaging of a horror classic, while Patricia Tallman is a fine spunky lead lady horror protag.

Group dynamics again explode, heroes and villains are born, and the creatures are high grade in scary construction.

Stonehearst Asylum (AKA: Eliza Graves) is directed by Brad Anderson and adapted to screenplay by Joe Gangemi. It's loosely based on an Edgar Allan Poe short story. It stars Kate Beckinsale, Jim Sturgess, David Thewlis, Ben Kingsley, Michael Caine, Jason Flemyng and Brendan Gleeson. Music is by John Debney and cinematography by Thomas Yatsko.

Stonehearst Asylum - Is nothing as it seems?

For his latest foray into the horror mystery realm, director Anderson provides a film that is away from conventionality's. The horror here is the blurry lines between sanity and insanity, and it has plenty of tricks and dark humour up its sleeves as well. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out quite early on what is going on at Stonehearst, the makers leave enough clues, but as the ungodly treatments show their hands, and the caustic observations on mental health and the treatment of such are made, there's a strong mystery element booming out of the screen.

Naturally this is a tale full of weird, wonderful and scary characters, and with that comes equal helpings of brutality and tenderness. The key characters are very Poesque, all magnificently framed by the Gothic surroundings (where the design department have worked wonders), while Yatsko's photography is gorgeous or chilly as required. Cast come up trumps, the right blend of Gothic ham and emotionally driven portrayals. Savaged by many critics upon release, it has risen above that to gain a deserved fan base, the word of mouth on the street crucially preparing newcomers for the tone of the play. 7/10",2017-01-29T19:10:07.068Z,8.0,Stonehearst Asylum,2014
241842,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"The original Dead Snow movie was actually not that bad. It was quite okay within its somewhat confined genre. Dead Snow 2 however is a major disappointment. It abandoned all pretence of actually being a real horror movie and wandered into the land of pure comedy…and failed miserably. This movie is like Bad Taste but on a higher budget (and regardless of what the fans want to pretend Bad Taste is a piece of shit movie).

The movie does have a plot that makes sense, again for this kind of movie, that has to be said but that lone does not make a good movie. There are literally NO really scary moments at all in this movie.

The movie has plenty of goory stuff. Actually the gore is pretty much thrown at the viewer from the first scene to the last. Unfortunately much of it is so ludicrous that it is embarrassing. To add to the embarrassment a bunch of absolutely nonsensical characters are thrown into the mix. The so called Zombie Squad is just pathetic. The Norwegian police office makes me squirm in my seat. The puking pet zombie makes me want to throw up my supper.
This movie is nothing but brain-dead people (and I am not talking only about the zombies here) and tasteless effects stacked onto each other. The only reason it does not get a single star is that there was one or two laughs in there and because some of the ludicrously overdone gory effects was not too bad from a technical point of view.

As I wrote it was a major disappointment. This movie can only appeal to the die hard fans of the genre or, with its frequent puking scenes, bad jokes and senseless gore to people who … well I will not go there actually.",2018-03-06T15:54:29.103Z,2.0,Dead Snow 2: Red vs. Dead,2014
713704,garethmb,"Evil Dead Rise Gives Series Fans A Fresh Take And Plenty Of Gore
Usually when a film series is embarking on a fifth outing the challenges
of keeping things fresh and original yet being new and creative can be a
massive obstacle.

Horror series ranging  from “Halloween” to “Friday the 13th”, “SAW”, and
“A Nightmare on Elm Street” all faced issues with moving the series along
yet trying to stay true to the original film that inspired them and in
every case; failing to fully capture what made the original film a hit.

“Evil Dead Rise” is not only the latest entry into the series but a bold
take on the cinematic series as it abandons the remote cabin setting of
the first two films and the reboot in favor of an urban setting.

The film does open in a remote lakeside locale before jumping a day
earlier to California where estranged sisters Ellie (Alyssa Sutherland)
and Beth (Lilly Sullivan) reunite. Beth has been working as a guitar
technician and bristles that her sister refers to her as a groupie.

Ellie is raising three children after their father left and informs her
sister that the building they are living in is scheduled to be demolished
so they will have to move soon which is a shock to Beth as she has learned
that she is pregnant and is trying to figure out her life all the while
seeing what she thought would be a source of stability for her upended.

The arrival of an earthquake allows access to a hidden area in the parking
garage of their building and since the locale was a former bank; the kids
soon find a hidden book and records which the only son Danny (Morgan
Davies) hopes he can sell despite his sister Bridget (Gabrielle Echols)
admonishing him constantly to leave it alone and return it to where it was
found.

The book turns out to be a Necronomicon or “Book of the Dead” and as fans
of the series know; nothing good ever comes from one and thanks to playing
old records left by a Priest describing his thoughts on the book; a
summoning incantation is read and this causes Ellie to become possessed
and unleash grotesque carnage and terror on her family.

What follows is a gory and at times intense game of cat and mouse
punctuated by moments of levity as the demonic infestation knows no end.

The film has the over-the top- gore that is expected of the series and the
makeup and effects are very effective. Writer? Director Lee Cronin has done
a great job capturing the tone of the series while moving it forward as he
cleverly incorporates lines and nods to the series without making them
seem forced.

Some may find the excess of blood too much but the series has always been
known for taking things to the extreme as the blend of horror and comedic
parody is what made the original film such a success.

In the end “Evil Dead Rise” does enough to keep fans of the series happy
and hopefully, we will be seeing a new entry in the series in the future.

713704,Chris Sawin,"_Evil Dead Rise_ is mostly entertaining as a new entry of the _Evil Dead_ franchise, but it’s got some hiccups that should be ironed out in any potential sequel.

The cast’s performances are all strong, with Sutherland masterfully making the most of her character with spine-tingling body language and unnerving dialogue, but as a fifth film in a well-known horror franchise, it’s disappointing to see that its most memorable moments are throwbacks to previous films.

Ultimately, _Evil Dead Rise_’s biggest flaw is that it simply isn’t as good as its ten-year-old predecessor. Nevertheless, the film is fun, blood splattering carnage that will hopefully take the _Evil Dead_ franchise in a bold and exhilarating direction.

713704,CinemaSerf,"This is certainly a triumph for the visual and audio effects folks. Otherwise, I found it all a bit derivative and frankly a rather classless rehash of the much more entertaining original. It's tough to just keep on re-inventing these themes - they do tire, and as I reckon with the recent updates of the ""Halloween"" franchise, they maybe just rely too heavily on a current generation who were not around to see the originals in the cinema first time round, and who maybe just don't appreciate that the acting and the writing - though never exactly crucial to these plots - did have more of a role than just relying on well made-up (virtual) demons spinning around the ceiling emitting threatening shrieks. It's not terrible - it moves along quickly for ninety minutes and might just put you off a bath anytime shortly afterwards, but there just isn't any real sense of menace or jeopardy and to be honest I wasn't entirely sure that the family weren't nightmarish enough - before their visitor arrived. Perfectly watchable on the telly around Halloween with a drink in your hand, and it's a sort of gift that keeps on giving because you'll be able to watch it again the next year without the faintest recollection of what is going to happen!",2023-05-16T12:25:17.923Z,6.0,Evil Dead Rise,2023
713704,Nathan,"Evil Dead Rise puts a creative spin on the classic franchise while also remaining faithful to the core experience.

The story is not overly complex and admittedly somewhat generic, as the main characters find the Book of the Dead, read it, and all hell breaks loose. But the conditions surrounding this plot are what truly set it apart. For one, the high-rise setting was brilliant and created a very claustrophobic environment that worked really well. I found the earthquake to be an original idea not only for the discovery of The Necronomicon but also for the entrapment of our main characters.

Speaking of our cast, this film does a really great job of setting up these characters. I genuinely liked all of them, which made it difficult to see some of them go, unlike in Evil Dead (2013). The familiar bond between them was palpable, and this could not have been done without a fantastic cast. Alyssa Sutherland is by far my favorite Deadite in the entire franchise. Her motherly connection was haunting, her facial expressions, and mannerisms are nightmare fuel. Lily Sullivan was genuinely fantastic as a final girl. Her badass nature to defend the children is incredible, and she had some really great moments to stand out in the film. The kids overall did fine, nothing that was too amazing but nothing that took away from the film either.

The direction was my favorite part of the film by far. Lee Cronin did such a fantastic job with haunting camera work with subtle tilts and use of reflections. The action was top-notch, and the practical effects were amazing. So many scenes had me physically wincing with some insanely creative violence mixed with stomach-churning blood and wound effects. It is definitely a worthy successor to Evil Dead (2013) in the gore department.

Overall, this may not be the best in the franchise, but I think it is one of the most refined. The story lacks in some areas, but the direction, performances, and violence really cement this as one of the best horror films of the year.

I find most of these films boring, predictable, stupid and not especially scary. In fact, the only ones to which I’ll even give a second look are smart horror films (like “Get Out” (2017) or “Annihilation” (2018)) or campy romps (like “Renfield” (2023)). So the fact that I somehow managed to sit through this trash heap is quite an accomplishment. (Actually, the only reason I watched was because I was channel surfing and there was nothing else on, so I decided to give it a chance (I would have been better turning on the radio).) This pointless parade of endless blood and gore is a prime example of the decline of the mainstream movie industry (how projects like this get greenlighted is beyond me, except, of course, for the obvious box office considerations). It’s so utterly ridiculous that the picture plays like something that was made up as the crew went along. I’ll admit that there was some modestly cheeky humor here, but not enough to make it a genuine camp fest.

11906,tmdb17996075,"There seems to be a never-ending feud between many horror fans regarding 'Suspiria', due to the fact that this film is considered Dario Argento's outstanding masterpiece. Personally, I'm completely against the idea of praising something that you don't actually like, so I respect anyone who thinks that this movie is overrated or even plain awful. My summary is only an opinion, but by no means I intend to make people change their mind or disapprove their concept of this film.

'Suspiria' is one of the many Italian horror films that came out during the late 70s and early 80s, that is extremely criticized for having a supposedly questionable plot and denouement. If we compare this movie to some of the other popular films directed by Dario Argento, we're probably going to think that 'Suspiria', is perhaps not as intriguing or well developed, when it comes to the story. To give a few examples of some of the Argento films that are widely considered the actual masterpieces because they offer an intriguing plot, good imagery and well done endings, I would probably name 'The Bird with the Crystal Plumage', 'Deep Red' and 'The Cat o' Nine Tails'. So what is it that we should believe? Nothing! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and even though I agree with those who claim that 'Suspiria' is Argento's real masterpiece, I would never waste my time trying to convince people that this is true. As a matter of fact, I'll be honest and say that I also believe that 'Suspiria' has a somehow underdeveloped story, but I still regard it as one of the best horror movies in history. The reason is simple: in my opinion, you can make something wonderful, without a wonderful plot. This is perhaps one of the most visually enchanting horror movies I have seen so far and I honestly doubt I will ever find another film that can enchant me as much as this one. Everything about 'Suspiria' is beautiful, even the violent deaths. I know this may sound sick and disgusting, but I believe Mr. Argento has the special gift to make beautiful images out of gruesome situations, like murder, for example. From the beginning until the end, this film takes us to a dark dreamland with beautiful contrasting colors, eerie locations and a recurrent unsettling music. The locations are perfect. The ballet school in which the story takes place, seems to be a nonexistent place taken from someone's dream. Indeed, it was revealed once that 'Suspiria' was partly inspired by a dream that Daria Nicolodi once had (Mrs. Nicolodi was the co-writer and Argento's girlfriend at the time). So if the idea was to create a dream-like movie, I would say they did a perfect job. Everything about 'Suspiria' looks surreal and charming. It's a dark fairy tale, in which the characters behave in a childish way, like playing along with the scenario. It is also said that the actresses were initially supposed to be little girls, but fearing that the film could be banned, Argento had to choose older actresses, but he didn't really change much of the dialogs, which I think is genius. Strangely, the characters don't come off as moronic or anything, they simply are strange and childish, but in a good way. The subject of sex, for example, is barely even mentioned, which is something that doesn't happen too often in horror movies with twenty-something year old characters. But regarding the actors who played these characters, I would mostly compliment the work of the late actresses Joan Bennett and Alida Valli. The young cast was simply fine, but no one did a remarkable job. Not even Jessica Harper, who was a bad choice for the lead character, in my opinion. This is probably the only little detail I would criticize about this film. Mrs. Harper pretty much has the same facial expression and tone of voice throughout the entire film, which is not good. On the other hand, like I said before, Mrs. Valli and Mrs. Bennett were flawless as the two bitter old women who run the school with their awful temper and their little psychological tortures against those who stand in their ways.

So concluding: 'Suspiria' is one of those films that you either love or hate. Both feelings are equally respectable and I can understand why some people don't really appreciate it. But if I have to recommend or 'sell' this movie to someone, I would definitely highlight the dream-like imagery and the creepy music composed by The Goblins, that go perfectly well with what is seen on the screen.

This is a masterpiece. Nothing will ever come close to this movie’s cinematography and soundtrack. Many people comment on the ‘style over substance’ aspect of Suspiria (and some of Argento’s other films), but I don’t see it as a flaw. It’s an experience. I don’t care if everything makes 100% perfect sense, when I put Suspiria on I feel transported to another world and that’s the best kind of movie. One that can just take you away from the real world. 

Suspiria is oddly comforting to me. I guess it’s that taking me away from the world feeling. It feels like a hug which I know isn’t what Argento was going for, but hey, apparently people ran out of theatres screaming in the 70s and I’m just a freak.

Would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I can’t imagine not liking it. I get that the dubbing and the cinematography or whatever may be a little jarring at first as beautiful it is, but go in with an open mind and let yourself get lost in the beautiful world of Suspiria and I can’t see anyone at least not somewhat liking it.

Before taking off for Paris, Alex Browning has a vision that the plane is going to explode.

With the number of hugely disappointing teens in peril movies that were made post the success of Wes Craven's hugely successful Scream, it's refreshing to find one that was, well, refreshing. Not purporting to be anything other than a wickedly entertaining piece of horror based nonsense, Final Destination is inventive, funny and above all else, shock laden.

From the opening, and terrifying air crash sequence to the clever and gross way that our protagonists shake hands with the grim reaper, this film is gloriously proud of its horror intent. One peak at the surnames of the characters will tell you just how into their horror roots the makers are here, whilst not a homage movie as such, James Wong and his team clearly know what makes a modern horror picture work.

If you find yourself complaining about the writing then you clearly are missing the point of Final Destination's existence, either that or you are in fact dead yourself!

9532,Wuchak,"***Innovative premise for a 'Dead Teenager Movie,' but the last act isn’t compelling***  

This first ""Final Destination"" movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper. A group of people escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways. The opening tragedy in this case is a plane crash; in the second film it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.

I've seen (and own) the first four of the currently five-film franchise, but they all tell the same basic story with different characters and a different location and are all of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same.

This first one has a quality heroine or 'final girl' in Ali Larter. Amanda Detmer is also on hand as a fellow student while Kristen Cloke plays a freaked-out teacher. They coulda done better showcasing these women IMHO. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum there’s Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott and Chad Donella. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his first of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.

For me, what makes these movies kinda dull is the fact that it's impossible to cheat Death. Sure, you can escape it here or there, but Death's been in business for millennia and expertly knows what he's doing. As such, everyone's gonna die except maybe the 'final girl,' who will most certainly die in the sequel.

The script began as an X-Files teleplay and, indeed, the movie was made by two veterans of that series. And you can tell due to the basic feel of the movie and the inclusion of two government agents. I’d give “Final Destination” a higher grade because I love the concept, but this one curiously gets dull in the final act (despite all the ‘exciting’ things going on) and they coulda done more with the women.

The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area (although the events take place around New York City).

9532,RalphRahal,"Final Destination kicks off with an eerie premise that immediately sets the tone for what’s to come. The plot follows a group of characters who narrowly escape a disaster, only to realize that fate doesn’t like being cheated. Instead of diving deep into the mystery of why things are happening, the movie focuses more on tension and the creative ways death finds its victims. While the concept is solid, the execution sometimes feels a bit surface-level, making it more about the spectacle than the psychological depth it hints at.

The directing does a good job of keeping the suspense alive, using clever foreshadowing and unsettling visual cues to build tension. Cinematography plays into this well, with zoom-ins on seemingly random objects that later become crucial, adding an extra layer of unease. The film also makes great use of lighting and framing to amplify the feeling that something ominous is always lurking around the corner. It’s not a groundbreaking approach, but it works effectively within the horror-thriller genre.

Acting is decent for the type of movie it is, with a few standout performances that help sell the fear and paranoia. The script keeps things moving, though some dialogue can feel a little forced at times. Where the movie really shines is in its sound design, using an eerie score and well-placed sound effects to enhance the tension.

9532,r96sk,"<em>'Final Destination'</em> is top entertainment! I've been meaning to watch this franchise for ages - happy to get started. The only thing I know coming in is there's some sort of scene with a car driving behind a (presumably unsafely loaded) lorry? Presumably that's in a sequel.

This is the first time I've watched Devon Sawa at this age of his, I know from watching TV's <em>'Chucky'</em> that people always mention this film(s?) when talking about him. He is a well chosen lead, for sure. Ali Larter is solid too. Interesting to see Seann William Scott involved.

Some of the characters behind that trio are iffy, in terms of how they are written/portrayed. Kerr Smith's Carter is mostly annoying, for example. Larter's Clear is written a bit odd around the middle part too. The bit with touching the thing (no spoilers) with Kristen Cloke's character is also silly.

To be fair, it is a movie designed to be entertaining rather than being something super intricate and highly logical. It does deliver in regards to the former, the effects are great and the deaths do get nicely creative. It is well paced as well, a 90 minute run time is perfect for a film like this.

I will say that the ending seemed a bit off to me (if still fun and fine), it kinda felt like the filmmakers didn't know how to end it given how the 'skipping' works and obviously they wanted to set a sequel. It's not a big issue whatsoever, it did seem a little roughly concluded though.

All in all, as you can see from my rating, I did love watching it. Interested to see how the follows-up turned up, I'd imagine it's a mixed bag (at best) but time will tell.",2025-03-18T14:53:07.239Z,9.0,Final Destination,2000

Next thing, well the river is being trawled and everyone is confused. Is he some sort of terrorist? Is he a warlock? Was it all fate or is there more to come? Is anyone safe? This is actually quite a solid story about just how people deal with trauma, grief and death whilst also introducing that mysterious question of pre-determination. Is death a thing that’s fluid, alive and scheming - or was it just bad luck that someone was aboard a busted aircraft or got hit by a bus or got their head sliced off by a rogue piece of metal…? Anyway, James Wong does well to galvanise a pretty lacklustre collection of acting talent, most of whom would entirely deserve any grizzly fate, and the stunt co-ordinators and visual effects technicians deliver something that has it’s tongue in it’s cheek (even if that’s not necessarily in a head on the right shoulders) - and just who was that mortician?

787752,RalphRahal,"Fresh (2022) is an interesting mix of horror and dark humor, taking a different approach to the usual thriller setup. The plot starts off engaging, following a modern dating experience that quickly spirals into something unexpected. While the premise isn’t exactly new, the way it unfolds keeps things unsettling enough to hold attention. It does lose some of its sharpness as it goes on, leaning a little too much on familiar horror tropes, but it still manages to keep things entertaining. The writing is decent, though some character decisions feel out of place, making certain moments less believable than they should be.

The directing is solid, with a good balance of tension and style. There’s an interesting use of close-up shots that add to the unease without feeling forced. The cinematography stands out, using lighting and framing to create an eerie atmosphere that matches the film's tone. The sound design and score do their job well, adding to the creep factor without being overbearing. It’s not the kind of movie where the music steals the show, but it complements the visuals nicely.

Acting-wise, Daisy Edgar-Jones carries the film effortlessly, making her character feel natural and relatable even when the script stumbles. Sebastian Stan brings a fun and unsettling energy to his role, making the dynamic between the two leads work well. Some of the supporting cast feel a bit underdeveloped, but the main performances keep things engaging. Overall, Fresh is an entertaining watch that delivers just enough tension and style to stand out. And while the story may not be entirely original, at least some parts of it are very well done… just not overcooked.",2025-03-07T21:17:53.616Z,5.0,Fresh,2022
338967,SWITCH.,"Even with its flaws, ‘Zombieland: Double Tap’ doesn’t overstay its welcome with its 99-minute run time, and remains a solid piece of popcorn entertainment. Although it doesn’t push any boundaries, it’s harmless fun (the Homer zombie of horror films, if you will... that’ll make more sense after you’ve seen it). So stumble into a cinema and join these friends on a reunion - sure, one filled with endless blood, guts and brains, but that’s half the fun of a zombie comedy, right?

338967,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

As you probably know by now, since I posted the original film's review a few hours ago, I loved the first Zombieland. I defend that it's a zombie cult classic, and I was genuinely pumped for its sequel. It didn't go through any external controversy (something quite rare nowadays), the cast didn't say anything wrong in the interviews (haters didn't have enough words to twist this time around), Ruben Fleischer returns as the director, as well as Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (plus a new member, Dave Callaham) as the screenwriters. If a studio wants to do a 10-year sequel, it might as well get the creators and original cast back together, right?!

That's what I love the most about Double Tap. It didn't lose the original's essence, and it didn't forget what made it so successful. The cast's chemistry can be felt thousands of miles away, but the new additions also fit in seamlessly. Zoey Deutch portrays Madison, a purposefully stereotypical ""dumb blonde girl"" who has some of the funniest scenes as well as some of the most cringe-worthy (Deutch gives an excellent performance, though). And Rosario Dawson plays Nevada, basically a women version of Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), which means she has a bunch of badass action sequences. As for the old gang, well…

Everyone delivers great performances, but this time, Harrelson really elevated his character. Not only does he have the expected awesome kickass moments, but he also offers some emotionally compelling displays. Emma Stone (Wichita) and Abigail Breslin (Little Rock) keep being amazing as their characters, and Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus) does get a bit too … Jesse Eisenberg, but it never stops feeling natural, having in mind how his character acts. These four are the heart of the whole show. Hence, getting the original cast back together is halfway through success, even more than in the first movie. Story-wise is where I do have some complaints, unfortunately.

Maybe it's due to the fact that I watched 2009's Zombieland just a couple of hours before Double Tap's screening, but I wish that Fleischer and his team were more creative. Sure, the original was 10 years ago, and not everyone is going to rewatch the original (especially not right before), so it's expected that a lot of classic moments are recreated in some shape or form. However, for an extended period, I felt that I was watching the exact same film, just with older characters. I know I'm going to hear some of Columbus' original famous rules, but there's a surprising lack of new ones. I know Tal is going to repeat some of his catchphrases, but he's an imaginative guy, he can think of fresh ones (which he does say in the last minutes, but still).

To move the plot forward or actually make the story happen, a lot of questionable things occur, and not in the sense of them not being rational (it's not like Zombieland is a groundbreaking piece of storytelling). It's the apparent lack of character development through all of the years that have passed, and I'm not addressing their personalities being the same (it's pretty normal). To create this movie, characters make decisions that don't feel right, having in mind they spent so much time together. It's impossible for love, trust, and emotional attachment not to be developed throughout such a long time. So, while Little Rock's arc is understandable and relatable, Wichita and Columbus' lacks convincing arguments, in my opinion. Both make decisions too dumb for such intelligent characters, but I guess ""that's love"".

Once again, the technical features that defined the original so clearly are seamlessly employed in its sequel. Beautiful production design, cool soundtrack, fantastic application of practical effects and real sets, which nowadays are getting rarer. The slightly longer runtime still manages to carry a fast pace, which is always a good attribute, and it's packed with thrilling, hilarious, bloody action sequences. Amusing pop culture references, and the most significant moment of all: Double Tap has one of the best, if not THE best, mid-credits scene of the year! Don't you dare leave the theater, it's right at the beginning of the credits, so stay in your seat!

All in all, Zombieland: Double Tap pays a decent homage to the original zombie cult classic by getting everyone (cast and crew) back together, and delivering yet another entertaining flick. By maintaining the essence of the first film, Ruben Fleischer is able to capture the outstanding cast's chemistry, as well as present those amazingly entertaining action sequences. Even though the central narrative isn't as straightforward and interesting as in the original, it's still captivating enough for the audience to care about. There is an excessive amount of callbacks to classic catchphrases, rules, or moments, which shows a bit of a lack of imagination to create new material. While it's not as funny or entertaining as the 2009's movie, it's still a good time. If you're a fan of Zombieland, definitely watch it! If not, well… Nut up and watch it or shut up and let others enjoy it.

> _I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead._

- Jimmy Buffett; ""Growing Older But Not Up"" (1981)

The original _Zombieland_ (2009) was something of a sleeper hit, earning over $100 million against a $24 million budget, becoming the most financially successful zombie movie ever made, until it was surpassed by Marc Forster's asinine _World War Z_ (2013). Smart, funny, and self-aware, it didn't take itself too seriously, and it had bucket-loads of heart, but it was hardly a film crying out for a sequel. And as time passed, it seemed more and more unlikely such a sequel would happen. However, after a decade in development hell, _Zombieland: Double Tap_ has arrived, and boy is it one of the most unnecessary sequels I've seen in quite some time. However, as unnecessary as it is, it's also extremely enjoyable. It doesn't do a whole lot that wasn't in the original, but the irreverent sense of humour, fourth wall breaks, sharp character interactions, and, most importantly, shedloads of charm are all present and accounted for. Directed by Ruben Fleischer (who helmed the original) and written by Rhett Rees and Paul Wernick (who wrote the original), along with Dave Callaham, _Double Tap_ may not take too many risks, but it's a fine companion piece.

10 years after the events in the first film, the quartet is still together and still getting on one another's nerves – there's the neurotic but sweet Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg doing his Jessie Eisenberg thing), the crass but caring Tallahassee (a wonderfully acerbic Woody Harrelson), the sarcastic Wichita (a dead-pan Emma Stone) and the laidback Little Rock (Abigail Breslin doing a lot with the little she's given). As we meet them, they're in the process of taking up residence in the White House – Columbus and Wichita are still a couple, but recently, she's started to wonder if perhaps their relationship is more important to him than it is to her; Little Rock is now a young woman who resents the fact that Tallahassee still treats her like she's 11; and Tallahassee, for his part, hasn't changed an iota. After Columbus proposes to Wichita (using the Hope Diamond), she and Little Rock skip town, but she returns a month later, telling the others that Little Rock ditched her and headed to a supposed zombie-free commune. And so the trio reluctantly set out to find her. Along the way, we're introduced to Madison (Zoey Deutch, who completely steals the film), a millennial bimbo who's been holed up in walk-in freezer; Berkeley (Avan Jogia), a peace-loving hippie; Nevada (Rosario Dawson), a tough-as-nails Elvis aficionado; and Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch), who are eerily similar to Tallahassee and Columbus (the reveal of which was spoiled by the trailer). There's also a new breed of zombie, which is faster, stronger, and more intelligent than the regular kind, and which can only be killed with multiple head-shots.

And that's about it as far as the plot goes. The original film came at a time when the zombie genre was just starting to be taken more seriously – Danny Boyle's _28 Days Later_ and Juan Carlos Fresnadillo's _28 Weeks Later_ were released in 2002 and 2007, respectively, introducing all manner of innovations and turning many of the genre tropes on their head; Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza's _[•REC]_ films were released in 2007 and 2009, setting a new standard for found footage films; _The Walking Dead_ debuted in 2010, and for the first few seasons it was as well-reviewed a show as you could find (until it turned into repetitive self-parody). Zombies also featured heavily in video game franchises of the era, such as _Siren_ (2003), _Dead Rising_ (2006), _Dead Space_ (2008), and _Dead Island_ (2011). _Zombieland_ cared about none of that – it was, in fact, the inverse of such titles, a film that didn't take anything seriously, least of all itself. 

With this in mind, although 10 years have passed and the landscape is very different, one of the sequel's most successful elements is that next to nothing has changed; in essence, it acknowledges the gap precisely by ignoring it. So, Columbus's opening voiceover specifically refers to the long break as he thanks us for choosing _Double Tap_ when there is such ""_a wide choice of zombie entertainment_"" and Madison tells Tallahassee his catchphrase is ""_very 2009_"", but the film as a whole feels as if it was shot immediately after the original. Of course, this is important insofar as in the universe of the franchise, the last decade has been very different to the last decade of our reality, so the filmmakers can't layer in too many contemporary references – although Columbus does mention how ""_unrealistic_"" _The Walking Dead_ comics are, there's a hilarious deconstruction of the concept of Uber, and there's a subtle allusion to Trump when Wichita sarcastically tells Tallassee he'd have brought ""a real dignity"" to the office of the presidency.

This factors into the performances as well, insofar as Columbus, Tallahassee, and Wichita are all broadly similar to how they were 10 years ago. Little Rock has changed significantly, but that's as much to do with the fact that she was a child in the original and is now a young woman. This lack of character development may sound like a bad thing, but really, the familiarity of the characters and their group dynamic has its own inherent charm, we welcome it because it's familiar, with the cast essentially doing the same things they did in the original. Speaking of performances, Zoey Deutch completely owns every scene she's in. Sure, the character is clichéd as all hell and, on paper, she should be all kinds of annoying, but that she isn't, is a testament to Deutch's warm performance, finding genuine pathos amidst the perpetually peppy and cheerful high-energy ditz. She also has great chemistry with the original cast, especially Harrelson. In fact, all of the new actors have terrific chemistry, which is nice to see insofar as effortless chemistry was one of the hallmarks of the original.

In terms of problems, as mentioned, the film doesn't do a whole lot that wasn't in the original – the characters are the same, the narrative beats are the same, the group dynamic is the same, the sense of humour is the same – and for some, this will certainly be an issue. Indeed, as much as I enjoyed the film, I would have liked to see it take more risks (there's certainly nothing here to rival the inspired Bill Murray cameo). Because of this blanket similarity, there is a sense in which the sequel isn't really its own thing, it's defined primarily by what the original did rather than forging its own path, and a lot of the meta-humour only works if you know the original. Another problem is that it fails to do much with an interesting set-up, which sees women chaffing against traditional gender roles and the identities conferred on them by men. Once the gang end up on the road, this theme is pretty much forgotten (even with the introduction of Nevada, who seems more like a man's idea of what a tough woman should be than her own person). There are also more than a few clichés, primarily in relation to Madison (as blond a character as you'll ever meet) and the one-note Berkeley (a weed-smoking gun-hating hippie, who is literally introduced by way of a sitar on the soundtrack).

_Zombieland: Double Tap_ is undemanding and doesn't completely justify its existence, but it also does justice to the original, and never for one second does it take itself seriously. The effortlessness with which it slots into the original's groove is either funny in its own right or poor writing, depending on your perspective, but the film is smart enough to know and acknowledge that it feels slightly out of place in 2019, in a way the 2009 original did not. And if a little of the spark has been lost, the warmth, the characters, the jokes, and the playfulness more than make up for it.",2019-11-04T03:00:18.087Z,7.0,Zombieland: Double Tap,2019

1696,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**Between black comedy and disgusting horror, it's not a movie that wants to be taken seriously.**

Rob Zombie is a decidedly strong stomach man. His musical curriculum could be enough to prove it, but we still have his horror films, full proof of his taste for blood and shocking scenes. Personally, I'm not a fan of excessively bloody films, I think that the blood and deaths in a horror film shouldn't be indiscriminate, it ends up being counterproductive and having a perverse effect, as if we got used to it, making this type of resource less effective.

This film is the sequel to “House of 1000 Corpses”: starting where it ends, it shows us the siege of the decrepit Firefly house to arrest or massacre that family of degenerates. They manage to escape and will spread panic in the region, while the local police try everything to catch them. To understand this film, therefore, I recommend first seeing the film that gives rise to these events (and which is just as violent and disgusting as this one). However, I felt that this film has a slightly better script than its predecessor and that it tries to at least create a good story, ""Bonnie & Clyde"" style, with cultural references to Ned Kelly, Ma Barker and others.

The slash subgenre, to which this film belongs, has a legion of fans and some renowned films, namely the “Saw” franchise. They are films filled with violent deaths, infamous acts, obscenities and graphic content. I already expected this here. What I really don't understand is how Zombie tries to introduce comedy into a movie like this. Even dealing with black humor, attempts to introduce humor end up cutting the atmosphere.

Back to characters they already knew, Sid Haig and Bill Moseley continue to do a great job as actors. They dominate the film and their characters are both comic (it didn't work for me but…) and brutal and sadistic. Sherry Moon Zombie, who is the director's wife, gained more prominence in this film, where she appears naked (or almost) in several scenes. The veteran and prestigious Leslie Easterbrook (who most people will remember for her performance in the comedies of the “Police Academy” franchise) replaced Karen Black, but I confess that I felt at various times that the actress did not fit into this type of material. The film also features other well-known actors such as William Forsythe, Ken Foree, Danny Trejo and Taylor Maine.

Technically, the film has some points that deserve to be highlighted, starting with the use of good special effects and good digital resources, which the director took full advantage of. We cannot fail to observe with some pleasure the richness of detail in the sets and costumes, and the good work of the camera. The soundtrack features several well-known songs, and contributes to not taking the film too seriously.",2023-03-24T12:06:26.848Z,3.0,The Devil's Rejects,2005

19898,CinemaSerf,"With humanity finally having milked the earth to death, a sort of Noah’s Ark is hurtling through space in search of somewhere new for humanity to start again. Crewman “Bower” (Ben Foster) awakens from his hyper-sleep to find his inter-stellar vessel eerily devoid of crew and making some curious creaking noises. His explorations of the ship soon pairs him up with “Payton” (Dennis Quaid) whose pod had broken and who is just as disoriented. With the latter man staying on the bridge, “Bower” sets off into the body of the ship ill-prepared for what he is about to find. In some ways, this is reminiscent of “The Descent” (2005) with a decent chunk of menace, some end-to-end gruesomeness and a fair amount of spatial paranoia that Foster holds together well. Quaid is also on quite decent, if sparing, form too delivering a character that is never entirely trustworthy and there’s Cam Gigandet’s slightly enigmatic “Gallo” with whom “Bower” teams up as he manages to ally, after a fairly ropey start, with a small team of scientists holed up in the gunnels trying to work out their own way to safety. The visual effects and the photography have an effective claustrophobic sense of peril to them, and when coupled with some effective use of lighting and audio it all helps to create quite an ominous serious of scenarios. For a change, there is also some more meaningful - if not always so easily audible - dialogue as opposed to the usual gung-ho, yee-ha, type of stuff and I was pleasantly surprised with this well paced and above average sci-fi adventure.",2025-11-09T07:17:19.790Z,7.0,Pandorum,2009
8769,John Chard,"Christine

No Strawberry Girl, She’s Plymouth Fury. CQB 241.

Christine is directed by John Carpenter and adapted to screenplay by Bill Phillips from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Robert Prosky and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Carpenter and Alan Howarth and cinematography is by Donald M. Morgan.

How Do You Kill Something That Can’t Possibly Be Alive?

1983 was a busy year for Stephen King adaptations to the screen, along with Christine there was also Cujo and The Dead Zone, so for fans of the legendary author there was plenty to chew on. Christine tells the story of a possessed car that takes over the life of the school nerd, with devastating consequences. As a story that’s pretty much all there is to it, the beauty of the pic is how Carpenter ensures the car really does have a malevolent life of its own. The theme at work such as automobile obsession and the bonkers love story at the narrative heart, are not sacrificed for cheap shocks and gimmickry, but Carpenter rightly made the car the star and she doesn’t disappoint.

Christine’s move from being a knackered old banger to super shiny speedster runs concurrent with Arnie Cunningham’s (Gordon) transformation. Where once was the misfit being bullied, is now a supremely confident dude, he even dates one of the school babes. But with Christine’s love and protection comes great danger, and this lets Carpenter craft some super scenes. From self healing to fiery vengeance, the director brings his lensing skills to the party. Music, unsurprisingly for Carpenter, plays a key part as well. A ream of 50s Rock “n” Roll tunes play out of Christine’s radio to align with what is unfolding on screen, while the score is distinctly Carpenteresque.

Cast are very good in their efforts, though more of the wonderful H. D. Stanton should have been a requisite. Unfortunately the screenplay doesn’t afford many character instances to run smoothly, it sometimes feels like the studio demanded that Carpenter hurry up to the next Christine is evil scene instead of building the character bridges! However, it’s a film that may be undeniably 80s in tone of film making, but it has aged surprisingly well. Suspenseful, exciting and devilishly playful, this is another Carpenter movie worthy of re-evaluation. 8/10",2014-10-06T01:53:14.466Z,8.0,Christine,1983
8769,talisencrw,"One of the most intriguing coming-of-age stories in cinema, and this tends to be overlooked, both as a Stephen King story and horror film, in place of the more sensationalized frolic and mayhem of works such as 'The Shining', 'Carrie', 'Misery' and 'The Shawshank Redemption', which is a crying shame, because: a) John Carpenter is probably the finest director (at least Top 3) ever involved with King adaptations; and b) it perfectly conceptualizes, like earlier short experimental films by the likes of Kenneth Anger, the downright uncomfortable sleaziness and fetishism that has existed, mainly in America, between men and their cars.

Keith Gordon does some really fine acting here (as he did previously for Brian De Palma in 'Dressed to Kill') as all possible dynamics along the range from nerd to psycho. It's impressive that, while growing up in film, he obviously learned some of the tricks of the trade from such cinematic greats (at least of American film of the past 50 years) and ended up becoming a decent film helmer himself.

9/10 for me; Grade A Carpenter. It simply isn't top-tier for me, of his oeuvre, because I know he, like Sir Alfred Hitchcock, De Palma and other greats, is capable of cinematic perfection (Halloween, The Thing, etc.).",2016-04-11T06:04:08.774Z,9.0,Christine,1983
8769,DrewBlack,"“She’s a killer!” Said one of the promotional posters for John Carpenter’s feature film, based on the homonymous best-selling novel by famous writer Stephen King. Since its 1983 release, the movie has become a cult-classic, especially for gearheads and horror fans, thanks to its premise.

But is the movie a killer thriller or just a clunker 1980s film? For this reviewer, it is an absolutely enjoyable, fun to watch deep character study. Carpenter turns his wrenches on King’s over the top supernatural material, and polishes it into a clearer, more relatable version of the horror romance. 

The plot is intriguing to say the least. In the 1980s, a young, bullied nerd, Arnold “Arnie” Cunningham, buys a trashed red 1957 Plymouth Fury (named Christine by its previous owner) purely by impulse, as if he had fallen in love at first sight. He becomes obsessed with restoring the automobile to its former glory. His personality begins to change after that, as noticed by his best friend, Dennis, and his brand new girlfriend, Leigh. The car does share Arnie’s feelings, and will do anything to protect him… Even from his loved ones. An interesting take on an unhealthy romance, in which the parties are jealous and obsessed with one another, differing from King’s book, that used tropes such as possession to dictate the supernatural elements of the story.

If there was one person to be able to make a film of this sort, it had to be John Carpenter. Coming out of what would be (years later) considered one of his most important works, The Thing, one year prior, he took the director’s chair for the Christine project. Despite also being known for adventure thrillers (like Escape From New York and Assault on Precinct 13) and satirical takes on other genres (Dark Star being an example), he is considered one of the masters of the horror cinema, and it is not for no reason, as he had vast experience in the genre, with all time classics such as Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980) and the aforementioned The Thing (1982) already under his belt. After Christine, his horror resumé would only expand, with the additions of They Live (1988) and Blood River (1991). 
Even though Carpenter is greatly responsible for the success of Christine, he says it was one of his easiest works, which leads us to the reason he affirms such a thing: the phenomenal acting by rising star Keith Gordon. 

Gordon was an eager-to-learn filmmaker aspirant by that time, but also a rising name on the acting scene. Despite being more concentrated on plays at the moment, he took the part and made a good team with the director. Bringing creative elements such as changing his hairstyle when his personality would change, he took the challenge of a (as he described) Jekyll-and-Hyde, rangy type of character surprisingly well, having a noticeable division between the Arnie of the beginning and the Arnie of the ending. Alexandra Paul did a great job bringing the element of the worried lady in Leigh. John Stockwell played Dennis, the jock, the successful best friend of the loser. Despite being fun to watch,Stockwell was playing a stereotype, so his acting was what needed to be expected from the 80s hero. It wasn’t bland, in no way, but not outstanding. Stockwell would go on to retire from acting and become a filmmaker. But what is interesting about the casting choices in Christine is that the producer, Richard Kobritz, and the director agreed on having less human star power to its cast, to give the spotlight to the real star of the film: The 1957 Plymouth Fury, Christine herself.

The soundtrack is something to behold. The incredible 1980s electro-style original compositions blend so well into their scenes, because they were made by no other than John Carpenter himself, in his long time collaboration with Alan Howarth. The two composers also worked together in They Live, The Thing, Halloween and many others. When the one who is guiding the scenes makes the pieces who will accompany them, the two things become intrinsically related, assuring a good completion between the two. But something not to be overlooked is the amazing selection of 1950s songs, through which Christine “communicates”. They are a key element coming from the book itself (every chapter starts with a 50s Rock ‘n’ Roll quote), and represent Stephen King’s love for that time period. The rockabilly selection includes Buddy Holly’s Not Fade Away, Dion and the Belmonts’ I Wonder Why, and Danny and the Juniors’ Rock and Roll is Here to Stay. This blends not only with Christine’s communication, but also with Arnie becoming more “1950s” as the movie progresses, influenced by his obsession with his beloved car. And, of course, there needs to be an honorable mention to George Thorogood and the Destroyers’ Bad to the Bone, that features in a chilling opening.

Visually, the film is quite smart, especially for a time in which virtually no special effects were available. Using practical effects, such as recording a car being smashed in reverse, to create the effect of it rebuilding itself, the creativity is what pays off for a film that won’t look visually dated, even well over three and a half decades since its first release.

At the end of the road, Christine is a V8 powered monster movie thrill ride, with some old fashioned scares, a banger soundtrack, an acting with little turbo lag, visual effects that corner like they were on rails, and a pace that doesn’t run out of steam. Despite the premise being considered “silly”, the result can appeal to regular horror fans and gearheads alike… And she is ready to show you why.",2021-02-11T11:35:44.867Z,10.0,Christine,1983

Arnie is a nerdy teenager. Bullied but finds refuge in his lone friend Dennis. That is until Arnie becomes obsessed with his possessed car, an evil 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine. Now, those that are close to him are worried. They see a change. Then people turn up dead. Could Arnie be off-in the people that are wronging him or, is the car doing it? 

It’s confusing to know what or how Christine works. She has been possessed. But she can also affect people in a telepathic way. At the Drive-In, Christine makes Arnie’s date, Leigh, choke on a hamburger. It closes her throat or something. Music gets louder. Lights on the dashboard brighten. Doors lock. But that’s what’s scary. The ignorance. You never know. And Christine is such a devoted killer. She will destroy herself for bloodlust. She knows she can come back. It’s a car that's an unrelenting killer. 

Christine is a perfect movie for this time of year. It’s so dark, moody and dreary. Early John Carpenter films are so damn good. Even movies made during this low period. The Thing had just failed at the box office and he didn’t want to make this picture but ultimately came around. And it is a solid choice for satisfying that stray fear craving. The scenery and world that Carpenter had created is so detailed. So alive. It’s complemented with an amazing soundtrack of these creepy fifties tunes and Carpenter’s signature synth. The cast is fantastic. Keith Gordon is our lead, Arnie. At first I wrote him off as a stereotypical nerd. Gordon made it much more. John Stockwell is with him as always, Dennis. Jim to his Marlin Perkins. Harry Dean Stanton, Alexandra Paul, Robert Prosky and William Ostrander are all great too. Harry Dean Stanton is great as the detective. I love his slyness. Rest in Peace, Mr. Stanton.

I cannot suggest Christine more. It’s a Stephen King feature by John Carpenter. This has gone down as one of the better King adaptations. Even though it veered. Carpenter may not look at the film positively, but it is more than just a JOB piece. This movie is good. If you don’t find it frightening, then I think you might still find it entertaining.

399366,BadChristian,"Marrowbone is another drama being mismarketed as a horror movie. While I would agree that Marrowbone has some thriller elements, I felt that fear in the horror sense as much as horror felt through dread. Aside from the disappointment upon the realization that the trailers mislead me, Marrowbone is is a very solid film. All of the acting is great (although George MacKay doesn't really portray pain very authentically), the set is both beautiful and haunting, the camera work makes some memorable scenes, and the story is compelling. The Spanish title is The Secret of Marrowbone, which is a much better title. While I wasn't satisfied with the ending they chose and I still have unaddressed plot holes that still bother me, Marrowbone drew me in and I was pleased with the journey.",2018-11-19T22:02:23.047Z,8.0,Marrowbone,2017
399366,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A good psychological horror movie.**

For me, the only good thing about Halloween is the amount of horror movies on television. The Anglo-Saxon reader, don't get me wrong, I know it's a tradition very dear to the Americans and the British, and I respect that, in the same way I respect Dia de Los Muertos. But in my country, this tradition is non-existent. I only started hearing about it fifteen years ago, due to an irresistible alliance between commerce (always interested in selling trinkets and masks left over from Carnival) and the weight of globalization, which turns cultural variety into a homogeneous, tasteless soup. What we have in my country is just the Catholic celebration of All Saints and, the next day, the religious feast of the deceased, with the traditional pilgrimage to the cemeteries. For those who are not Christian or have no one dear in the cemetery, maybe these are days like any other. But let's get down to business!

As you can see, I saw this movie for Halloween, and I really liked what I saw. Despite the presence of Sérgio Sánchez, who signs the script and guarantees impeccable direction, and despite having been filmed and produced in Spain, the film features English-speaking actors and the entire story takes place in the United States. The script begins with the arrival of a mother, with her children, to her family home, which has been closed for a long time. It's clear from the start that they are on the run and hiding from an abusive husband/father left in Europe. Everything goes well until the mother's death, who leaves the children in the care of the eldest. From then on, they try to hide her death until he turns 21, the age from which he will be entitled to be the brothers' legal guardian, thus ensuring that they all remain together.

There's so much more to the script, it's not just a family melodrama about close-knit brothers and the dangers of an abusive father. Terror is very present in the remains of that decrepit house, where something else is present, and a dark secret hidden somewhere on the upper floor, totally inaccessible. The young orphans' relationship with Allie, their closest neighbor, and with a lawyer from the nearby town, will be the impetus for new developments, which will lead us to know more about the young people, and what really exists in that isolated house. The film is full of twists, and some of them surprised me a little.

George MacKay is the great protagonist of the film and gives us a truly superb, deep and sometimes disturbing interpretation. Despite the quality of the cast, in general, being good, he stands out from the others and steals our attention whenever he appears. Charlie Heaton is another good addition, and especially shines in the scenes where he plays with MacKay, in particular in his various conflicts. Tom Fisher is quite effective as a villain, even though he is not happy with his character, stripped of any depth and turned into a mad beast, a closet monster determined to eat little children. Anya Taylor-Joy was a nice and effective addition, but it has very little to do.

Technically, the film relies heavily on cinematography, filming locations, sound effects and set design. The cinematography takes advantage of the cold colors and misty days, as well as the dim light from the interiors of the house, and from the lit candles, to help create a tense and suitably somber atmosphere, which is thickened by the sound effects, very well used, and by the scenery of the country house, aged and in need of works. The house is transformed, as in other scary house movies, into an additional character in the plot, with its own personality and its own history and quirks. The choice of costumes and cars puts us in tune with the time when everything happens (the 50s). However, it lacks an effective and truly memorable soundtrack.",2022-11-12T05:03:24.829Z,9.0,Marrowbone,2017

In a town near coastal Georgia, a widow (Cate Blanchett) struggles to make ends meet with her three boys via her psychic abilities. When a young woman goes missing (Katie Holmes), the authorities ask her for assistance. Greg Kinnear, Keanu Reeves, Hilary Swank, Giovanni Ribisi, Gary Cole and JK Simmons are all on hand.

“The Gift” (2001) meshes plot elements of “Resurrection” (1980) with the setting or tone of “Murder in Coweta County,” “The General’s Daughter” and a little “Cape Fear” (1991). You can’t beat the cast and the Southern town ambiance is great, plus the flawed characters are nicely fleshed-out.

There are no less than five possibilities of who the culprit is and, with 20 minutes to go, it becomes clear who it is. Regrettably, it’s just so cliched and contrived I rolled my eyes, not to mention it ‘steals’ the hope of the viewer. I don’t want to say more because I don’t want to give anything away.

Still, if you can roll with that banal element, it’s a quality drama with a worthy point. Both Cate and Holmes are fetching in a girl-next-door kind of way.

36586,Gimly,"The second piece of this vampire hunter trilogy blurs the lines between Action, Super Hero and Horror, which personally I'm kinda liking.

This time around, Blade (Wesley Snipes; New Jack City, Chaos), Abraham Whistler (Planet of the Ape, Provinces of Night) and new arrival Scud (Norman Reedus; The Boondock Saints, Pandorum) must team up with the Blood Pack, made up of Dieter Reinhardt (Ron Perlman; Hellboy, Outlander), Nyssa Damaskinos (Hell Ride, Wrong Turn at Tahoe), Chupa (Matt Schulze; The Transporter, The Fast and the Furious), Asad (Danny-John Jules; Red Dwarf, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels), Snowman (Donnie Yen; IP Man, Highlander: Endgame), Verlaine (Marit Kile; Doctors, Blue Murder), Priest (Tony Curran; The Midnight Meat Train, Underworld: Evolution), and Lighthammer (Daz Crawford; Hammer of the Gods, Game Over) in order to defeat UberVamp Jared Nomak (personal favourite Luke Goss; Death Race 2, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Tekken) and his army of Reaper Strain Vampires.

With me so far? No? Then go watch the damn movie! It's very fucking good. The opening is almost as strong as the original, and pretty much everything else about it is better. Not to mention the fact that I'm a total Luke Goss fanboy. All of the characters are so much better. They interact and everything. And even though Wesley Snipes has never really impressed me as an actor, the character of Blade was a little less cheesy, which always helps, and basically just better all 'round.

SPOILERS FOR BLADE, BLADE II and TRINITY: An interesting point, without ruining anything about the trilogy is that in all three films, vampires fight vampires. Not in the whole ""Blade's half a vampire so he kills full-on vampires"" way, although there is most certainly that, but in Blade, Frost kills the Elder vampires to become La Magra. In Blade II, The Blood Pack and Blade team up to take down a new, much more dangerous breed of vampires. And in Trinity, Dracula goes around killing vampires, pretty much for fun. Just food for thought. I've never read the comics much myself, so I don't really know if that's something that's been going on for a while, or if it just turned out that way.

There were a couple of lame bits. Some very stupid lines like ""they took all of our weapons. Even your sword."" Even your sword! Man, the single weapon for which you were named after that has killed more vampires than any other thing on the planet, and the vampires took it away from you? The audacity! And there's this whole thing where Whistler is alive again, they went most of the way to explaining it, and then sort of forgot. It would have been so simple to have a four second flashback cover the lot of it. Oh well.

Still though, I'm very, very fond of this one.

Blade II was a significant step up for the Blade franchise (and, unfortunately, the trilogy's peak) with a much more experienced director and a unique and exciting premise. This time the vampires are the prey and are desperate to survive the growing horde of vampire zombies, desperate enough to side with their sworn enemy, Blade, in hopes of surviving this plague. Both Blade and Blade: Trinity placed inexperienced directors at the helm, but Blade II put experienced horror and creature director Guillermo del Toro in charge, and the result was outstanding! Blade II has the most horror influence of the trilogy and the best story. Del Toro's involvement in all three films might have saved the series, but instead, we got the all-out action letdown of Blade: Trinity. Wesley Snipes was a perfect choice for Blade, and surrounding him with a cast that included Ron Pearlman, Tony Curran, and Donnie Yen (all experienced in the genre and with action) makes Blade II a top-notch vampire action comic book film.",2023-02-11T06:00:58.321Z,8.0,Blade II,2002

This has quite a strong storyline, the characters are given some time to evolve and the chemistry between the rather static Snipes and Kris Kristofferson (""Whistler"") works well on the few occasions it is on screen - though not really well enough to compensate for pretty wooden performances from messrs. Goss and Reedus. As with the first film, the fight scenes are far too heavily staged; they rob the story of menace and the over-use of the soundtrack to accompany these extended, gory, slaughter-scenes really does reduce this to an almost cartoon status.

Behind him, Ron Perlman stands out.

I didn't know Norman Reedus was in this, love him in <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> - he elevates an otherwise forgettable character. Another favourite of mine is here too, as Matt Schulze of <em>'The Fast and the Furious'</em> fame appears. I also recognised Karel Roden, who distractingly has his lines dubbed by a British actor - very odd!

Lastly, I have to commend the special effects. The majority of which is admittedly as passable as was the case for <em>'Blade'</em>, but the new addition of that effect for the reaper mouths is outstanding - it genuinely still holds up to today.

Talking of the onscreen lot, Jean Marsh as Princess Mombi is the only performance I felt entertained by - she's very good. Away from her, there's not much to note. Fairuza Balk is solid in the role of Dorothy, nothing really to say about her other than she does an OK job; considering her age. The Wheelers are kinda interesting, they do look cool.

It's a shame they don't make use of Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and Tin Man - the latter I'm actually glad they didn't, given how awful his design was. I get why they don't feature more, given the source material, but it feels a needless change-up especially with Billina, Tik-Tok and Jack Pumpkinhead being so lame.

575776,SWITCH.,"'Saint Maud' is an insight into a very modern, very lonely existence that is sadly only too recognisable. It's a testament to how effective the film is that Glass aligns us closely with Maud to the grisly end, because she's really just acting on her own twisted nature, still looking for that elusive personal connection that will relieve a lifetime of loneliness. Glass delivers on so many levels as a writer/director that it's hard to believe this is her debut, establishing unease through suffocating mood, she finds fright in stillness, quiet, and isolation.

Is religious fanaticism a form of mental illness? Certainly the ""Four Horsemen"" of New Atheism (Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens, and Sam Harris) would argue it is. However, from the perspective of the fanatic, such fanaticism is often not only logical and justified, but unavoidable; they don't choose to be fanatical, they are compelled to be fanatical, no matter how insane their behaviour may seem. The disparity between what a fanatic believes and what other people believe is the main issue examined in _Saint Maud_, the stunning debut feature from writer/director Rose Glass. Part-horror, part-psychological thriller, part-character drama, part-ecclesiastical treatise, _Saint Maud_ can be read in a variety of ways – an analysis of the interaction between faith and self; a threnody for the life of a young woman suffering a mental breakdown; a drama about loneliness; a study of the importance of friendship; a tale of possession; a tragedy about the frailty of the human body. Told mainly (although not entirely) from the perspective of a fanatical Christian, the story makes room for the possibility that, however unlikely, such fanaticism isn't mental illness at all and that God really is communicating with this person. And this magnificently handled ambiguity is the film's trump card. Disturbing, horrifying, challenging, unpredictable, emotional, and occasionally very funny, this is a film that forges a path entirely its own, and is as impressive and daring a directorial debut as you're ever likely to find.

The film takes place in a thoroughly depressing English seaside town (it was shot in Scarborough, but the town in the film is unnamed). There we're introduced to Maud (an incredibly physical performance from Morfydd Clark), a recent convert to Roman Catholicism. Exceptionally devout, Maud believes that all of mankind is amoral, lustful, and wicked, and that only by way of a true saviour can we be saved. Is she that saviour? It's possible, because God has explicitly told her that he has very special plans for her in the near future. Before being called upon to save humanity, however, Maud is working as a private palliative care nurse, explaining to God (we hear her prayers in voiceover) that she feels tending to a dying person and treating them with kindness and dignity in their last days is akin to saving their soul. The story begins as Maud arrives for her first day with Amanda Köhl (the always brilliant Jennifer Ehle); a formerly world-famous American dancer and choreographer suffering from end-stage spinal lymphoma. Amanda has a reputation for being acerbic, but she and Maud get on well – Maud admires her strength of character and zest for life, whilst she wants to help Maud let her hair down a little. However, there are certain elements of Amanda's life of which Maud does not approve – her smoking and drinking, for example, or the frequent visits from Carol (Lily Frazer), Amanda's much younger lover, and as time goes by, Maud starts to exert more and more control over Amanda's life. Meanwhile, although God continues to promise Maud that the time is coming when she will be called upon, she's started to get a little frustrated waiting. And so, facing the possibility that something hideous from her past could resurface, Maud decides to prove to Amanda, God, and everyone else just how far mankind has fallen and just how sanctified she really is.

Although Maud is a hard-line fundamentalist, Glass refuses to dismiss her as an irredeemable monster, arguing instead that such individuals genuinely believe they really are communicating with the Divine. It's the old thing about how a crazy person doesn't know they're crazy, but manifested in a more complex form – Maud may be mentally ill, but even if that is the case (and the film is in no rush to confirm that it is), then surely she deserves compassion and kindness, so completely has her mind bent reality to support her delusion. As will be discussed in a moment, Glass tells much of the story from Maud's subjective perspective, and in this sense, it's almost understandable when she sees signs of God's presence in everyday things (an inexplicable whirlpool in a glass of beer, for example) and when she's occasionally rendered almost catatonic as the Holy Spirit flows through her. As the subjective perspective communicates brilliantly, this may be delusion, but if it is, it's a total delusion that she is powerless against. In a very real sense, she cannot be held accountable for her actions.

Even irrespective of mental health issues, however, Maud is all-in on the whole Catholic thing. She tells God about how important her work is, as it allows her to ""_save souls_"", which is the greatest task she can imagine; she credits her recent conversion to Catholicism as reversing the downward spiral of her life, explaining that she always felt ""_there was more than this_"", but it was only when she became a Catholic that she was allowed to see what that ""more"" was. She's also a firm adherent of the Job school of faith-by-suffering, cheerfully telling a beggar, ""_never waste your pain_"" and later engaging in some truly gnarly DIY shoemaking.

Along the same lines, she tolerates Amanda's little digs about her life and how lonely she seems, but when Amanda turns her caustic wit to Catholicism, Maud is unable to let that stand without offering rebuke. Of course, her relationship with Amanda forms much of the film's narrative backbone, and is deeply nuanced and layered, with neither woman allowed to occupy the moral high-ground. Ehle plays Amanda as profoundly bored with her failing body, whose isolation and inability to leave the house mean she must find amusement where she can, and so she seizes on this strange, ultra-serious young woman who has come to look after her. Amanda is never portrayed as a villain, but she does regard Maud as something of a plaything and Maud's reverential and humourless attitude as something to be joked about, not with the intention of hurting Maud, but with the intention of amusing herself. Amanda, however, fails to understand that these are not mutually exclusive intentions.

As strong as _Saint Maud_ is thematically, however, where it really excels is in its aesthetic design. Glass directs the hell out of it and there's not a weak link amongst her crew – from Ben Fordesman's murky cinematography to Paulina Rzeszowska's detailed production design to Paul Davies's oppressive sound design to Adam Janota Bzowski's creepy score to Mark Towns's ambiguous editing (including a shocking slam cut right at the end that's as brilliantly jarring and thematically crucial as anything in the work of Nicolas Roeg). 

Crucial to the overall aesthetic is how Glass handles perspective; most (although, crucially, not all) of the film is told from Maud's perspective, so we encounter her visions not as an objective third-party would, but as she herself does. So, for example, when she sees a small whirlpool spontaneously appear in a glass of beer, we see the same thing, and there's no cutaway to show us Maud staring at a normal glass, _sans_ whirlpool; when a towel placed near a crucifix falls to the ground for no obvious reason, we see it fall just as she does, and there's nothing to objectively suggest why it may have fallen; when God talks to her (in Welsh, no less), we hear His voice as she does, and there's no portion of the scene where we see Maud answering a voice we cannot hear.

Similarly, is it just a coincidence that so many shots of Maud are blocked with windows or lights in the background that create a halo effect, and is the shot of her walking on the beach, with a thin layer of water covering the sand, intentionally framed in such a way that it looks like she's walking on water? One particular scene near the end of the film, which I won't go into as it would be a spoiler, is especially important in the construction of a subjective point of view – what we're seeing couldn't possibly be anything other than psychosis, and yet the film has given us very little to confirm such a reading. Could it be that what Maud is experiencing is real? Is this scene confirmation that her mind has irreparably snapped, or is it confirmation that she was completely sane all along? Constructing a scene based on two literally inverse interpretations can't be easy, yet Glass does it so smoothly, you won't even realise the sharp dichotomy until it's all over. At the very least, even if we don't accept Maud's view of things, the film encourages us to sympathise with a woman undergoing a mental breakdown. There's no cynicism here – either Maud is truly in contact with God or she isn't, and if she isn't then her story is as much of a tragedy as Amanda's, and she deserves help, not condescension or ridicule.

Running only 84 minutes, it's extraordinary how much Glass squeezes into her debut feature; from the arresting performances by Clark and Ehle to the thematic complexity to the extraordinarily well-handled perspectival ambiguity to the haunting aesthetic design. Looking at issues such as trauma, faith, fundamentalism, sexuality, and human impermanence, the film has much more going on than the generic horror elements one might expect. Either a depiction of the mental collapse of a young woman or a study of the supernatural, the ambiguity might frustrate those who prefer their narratives with solid answers, but for the rest of us, there's much to embrace and celebrate here. One of the best directorial debuts I've seen in a long time, I was only half-way through the movie and I was already looking forward to whatever Glass might do next. _Saint Maud_ probably won't break any box-office records, but as a calling card, it's second-to-none, and we are going to be hearing a lot from Rose Glass in the future.",2020-03-12T01:58:47.314Z,9.0,Saint Maud,2019
575776,Giovanni,"Full Analysis at **_Spotamovie.com_** - **Intro** - Released in 2019, while in streaming in February 2021, Saint Maud is a British movie that belongs to drama, thriller, and mental health categories. It lasts for one hour and 24 minutes, and those are intense, disturbing, inspiring and, in our opinion, a must-watch.
We can add more flavours mentioning that Saint Maud won already ten awards and twenty-eight nominations. Among those awards, it got a BAFTA as “Outstanding British Film of the Year” and “Best Actress” to the protagonist of the story Morfydd Clark (Maud). - **The Story** - Maud is a nurse who brings with her a problematic past. Then, finally, she gets the strength to restart her life after her conversion to Catholicism. Life or God offers a new opportunity to Maud. She needs to assist Amanda, a formal ex-dancer and minor celebrity, in the last days of her life.
They will get to know each other and, it seems, in the right moment of their lives.

768,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I cannot say that I am an outright fan of old era British crime stories but I do fancy them now and then. This one is a rather dark, grim and gloomy story perfectly suitable as a evening movie at this time of the year when darkness already starts to come quickly and matches the candlelight mood of Victorian London.

I found this a quite nice movie. Well up to its very end which I have to admit is way too tragic for my taste. The voyage to the end was well worth watching though. The dark scenery is very well done. Beautiful and depressing at the same time. It is yet another Jack the Ripper based story and it is pretty much pure fiction loosely based on the character of Jack the Ripper. It is a good and well implemented story though and it was enjoyable to follow Inspector Abelard unravel to true reason behind the murders.

As far as I am concerned the acting was without any major faults and generally of high standard although it is perhaps a bit sad that Johnny Depp again proves that he plays best in roles that portrays a more or less crazy, even insane, character.

The movie is not as gory as one perhaps and it certainly would not classify as a horror movie. Most of the violence is hidden from the viewer although there are a couple of scenes which are a wee bit “splattery” but only if you really have a weak stomach for these things and if you do perhaps you should not watch serial killer movies in the first place.

The ending took a star or two off this movies rating but otherwise it was surprisingly enjoyable.",2014-10-14T13:44:55.503Z,7.0,From Hell,2001
768,talisencrw,"I went into this having only seen 'The Book of Eli' by these directors, The Hughes Brothers. I quite liked that film, although I did feel their vivacious stylizations interfered with the telling of the story. Seeing this earlier film of theirs confirmed that suspicion, though it's still a fine film. Though Johnny Depp (the brothers' 5th choice for the lead) does a fine job as the film's protagonist (I haven't read Alan Moore's graphic novel yet, so I can't say how this filmic adaptation compares), it certainly would have been interesting to see how any of their previous choices would have done (in order of their preference): Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Connery, Jude Law and Brad Pitt (but especially either of the first two). It has a fine supporting cast, is beautiful to look at and is consistently intriguing. I especially liked Heather Graham (I think this is solidly amongst her best work), Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane and, most significantly, Katlin Cartlidge.

768,Wuchak,"From Alan Moore, the Hughes brothers and Johnny Depp

RELEASED IN 2001 and directed by the Hughes brothers, ""From Hell"" details the Jack the Ripper slayings in the slummy Whitechapel district of London in autumn, 1888. Johnny Depp plays an opium-addicted detective while Robbie Coltrane appears as his colleague. Heather Graham is on hand as a prostitute that captures the Detective’s interest.

The film was based on Alan Moore’s graphic novel of the same name. Moore condemned the change of his ""gruff"" version of Frederick Abberline with an ""absinthe-swilling dandy,” referring to the protagonist played by Depp. In real life, there’s no evidence that Abberline “chased the dragon” or that he had “psychic visions.” Speaking of real life, Moore’s graphic novel was based in large part on the royal conspiracy theory popularized in Stephen Knight's 1976 book “Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution.” This is one of several theories on the identity of the slayer. True or (probably) not, it makes for a good story.

“From Hell” plays like a Hammer film, but with a blockbuster budget in the modern era. A couple of comparable Hammer flicks are “Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed” (1969) and “Taste the Blood of Dracula” (1970). “From Hell” even shares a minor subplot with the latter (high society ‘gentlemen’ in the Victorian era secretly partaking of taboo hedonistic pleasures). Like Hammer’s Gothic horror catalog, you can expect top hats & black coats, cobblestone streets, alluring women, a ghastly killer (or monster) and lush colors.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 2 minutes and was shot in Prague, Czech Republic, and England (Boscastle & Goldings).

Almost everyone else is old British guy, and it really feels like the complex mystery and drip-fed information investigation is really what makes the movie stand out.

They do go a weirdly tasteful route where they previous showed high schoolers being killed, but do not show younger children being killed.  I honestly didn't expect it given the amount of blood and wounds are shown, but not really gore come to think of it, at least not in this one.

8643,slayrrr666,"During the trial for his events, a lawyer tries to help her client, a priest, seek the truth about what happened to the young woman who died under his care while performing an exorcism to cure her of a demonic possession and eventually lets the truth about it be known.

This wasn't anywhere as bad as it could've been. The film is really split into two halves here with this one being basically helped greatly by its really good possession and shock scenes. The opening scene that sets her up to becoming possessed is one of it's best sequences, as the long hallway and the unearthly voices floating around give it an unearthly feel while the first scene in the classroom where she sees a demonic face appearing in the window through a cloud of mist and turns around to see a student's face turn into a distorted demon's face giving off an unearthly roar makes it quite shocking. Running out into the rain and seeing more demonic faces give off the same unearthly roar is a bit clichéd, but it still helps to sell the mood while the finale in the church giving this a quite creepy conclusion. The different manners of how she’s become afflicted are quite memorable moments with the frenzied bug-eating, speaking in tongues or just contorting her body into such impossible positions that it really becomes obvious something is wrong with her, and the long, suspenseful and chilling exorcism is the film's selling point, coming off with any number of creepy ideas and scenes in such a drawn-out style is one of the best scenes in the film. Otherwise, beyond the shocks and the exorcism, there isn't much else to like about it. Therefore, everything else in it doesn't really work which is only relegated to the courtroom battle drama. It's marketed as being a supernatural possession film, and the best moments come from those scenes, but the fact that the majority of the film is a courtroom battle with the supernatural elements coming in the form of flashbacks is a real misstep and is likely to confuse those coming in expecting the other kind of film. It's not that they're boring or anything, it's just that it's out of nowhere that it becomes that way, and it can be a disappointment. The fact that these are slow and really long don't help matters, extending this out far longer than it should. This could've easily been an hour and a half, or maybe a little longer, but the two hours running time forces it to keep the courtroom antics going for no reason other than to extend the running time. A few extraneous scenes could've been snipped as well, including the introductory scenes at the bar that repeat information we already know and also keep the running time going, and most of the time simply elicit a feeling of wanting to move along and get to the good scenes. These really harm the film.

8643,Wuchak,"**_Scares the hell out of ya_**

This was based on the actual story of a German girl who died while being exorcised in the late 1970s. The priest was then put on trial for neglectful homicide. Google it for details.

Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) plays an agnostic who defends the priest (Tom Wilkinson) while the prosecutor (Campbell Scott) is a believer. This creates some problems: How can an unbeliever defend a believer who performs a service that apparently kills the young woman? How can a believer come against another believer who was simply trying to deliver the girl from spiritual malevolence?

The prosecutor makes the case that the woman was ill with various mental disorders and that the exorcism was just a bunch of superstitious mumbo jumbo. By contrast, Erin Bruner argues that these illnesses were the RESULT OF possession -- that the girl's possession brought on the symptoms. This makes sense in light of the scriptural evidence of Jesus Christ delivering people from evil spirits who induced insanity, muteness and deafness.

Another important argument of the defense is that a potent drug that Emily was prescribed trapped her in a mode that was resistant to the exorcism.

The fascinating story provokes many questions. We need to take an honest look at our mental health practices and institutions. Although there are some genuinely good people working in this field who care about the patients, it seems that the best we can do is drug people and make them, more or less, numbed-up living zombies or even mindless vegetables. Unfortunately this is how they're damned to live the rest of their lives, subservient and dependent on the mental health establishment (that actually needs them to stay ill in order to exist).

Such people don't need more drugs and ""therapy."" What they need is delivered. They need delivered from evil spiritual powers that have possessed them. They need FREED. Don't mistake me here, I'm not against mental health people or facilities because I realize they're just doing what they know to do. It's just not working. Again, the mentally ill need delivered not force-fed more drugs and essentially locked-up for the rest of their lives. That's not life, it's living death!

Of course, releasing a horde of religious wackos into our mental institutions isn't the answer. Yet, what if some believers who walked in the boldness and authority of Jesus Christ were available, people who show documented evidence of DELIVERING the mentally ill? The New Testament relays case after case of Jesus Christ exorcising demons from hundreds of people, maybe thousands. He didn't numb 'em up and sentence them to a life of living death. Rather he came to set the prisoners free from darkness, heal the sick and heal the brokenhearted! If there are people out there who walk in this same anointing of power and freedom, shouldn't we allow them to minister to our mentally ill?

Unfortunately a large percentage of the church is very weak in regards to spiritual deliverance. Except for offering eternal salvation, which is wonderful, their gospel is powerless and next to worthless. Yet this wasn't the way of the early Church. Paul, Peter and others offered total deliverance. Thankfully, there are still a remnant of these types of believers and these are the ones who can help our mentally ill, as long as the oppressed WANT freedom, healing and deliverance (since some WANT to stay dependent and ""cared for"").

I'm only raising such moral/theological/philosophical questions because the film provokes it. So please don't be irked at me for getting all heavy and theological.

Despite the numerous courtroom scenes (which I'm not a fan of) there are certainly enough horrifying elements in ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" to please most horror fans, just don't expect Freddy or Jason shenanigans.

Interestingly, while it's horrifying ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is also somehow warm and faith-affirming, even sometimes beautiful.

My only criticism is a theological theory introduced late in the movie. This theory is incredible wrong. I won't elaborate except to say that God would never allow the option of Emily's possession as a supposed testimony to the world of the existence of dark spiritual powers, rather the God's purpose is always to deliver such people, which not only testifies to the existence of the malevolent powers but, more importantly, sets the person FREE and gives glory to the Almighty.

The film runs 119 (the unrated version 122 minutes) and was shot in Vancouver, BC.

It tries too hard in places and a few of the characters were unrealistic or maybe the acting was just bad. The dad was acted poorly and the neighbor girl was too old and unbelievable. She seemed like some 25-year-old Playboy Bunny crushing on the nerdy kid she used to babysit. There is no universe in the multiverse where this would happen. All that said, the conclusion was pretty good and obviously opens it up for a sequel at some point.

Trick 'r Treat plays out as an anthology of four Halloween related stories. One tiny figure with a burlap sack over its head links the film together.

Warner Brothers kept it on the shelf for two years, a mistake since it happens to be a delightful little frightener that appears to be made with a love of omnibus shockers from back in the day. It's never overtly scary or bloody, but it has a twisted slickness that is rather pleasing in this day and age of poor horror remakes and boorish cash cow sequels.

Arriving at a Swiss Academy for girls, Jennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly) gets embroiled in the workings of a serial killer. Her friends the insects and Professor John McGregor (Donald Pleasence) are on hand to help if possible.

Directed and co-written by horror legend Dario Argento, Phenomena is a mixed bag. Ignoring the butchered American version, which was titled Creepers, the full uncut version is still messy. Argento the director is doing good work here, which explains why the film has a sturdy reputation. His eye for striking imagery and horror scene staging is evident here for sure, but Argento the writer (along with Franco Ferrini) fails to string a decent enough narrative together. Pace is all over the place, the dialogue often boorish, while wasting Donald Pleasence is a crime against horror film making.

The Austrian thriller-drama, is going to contend with another nearly 100 movies from the different countries for the upcoming (2016) American Academy Awards. I hope it will make into the final shortlist and my wishes to the cast and the crew. A minimal cast movie, set in an isolated lake house where the 9 years old twin boys and their mother lives. After their mother returning from the major facial surgery, the brothers doubts is she's the same person. They have no choice, but have to go for an unusual route to find out the truth.

Initially it was very slow, but keeps accelerating since the beginning of the second half and it ends strongly. You have to be an open minded, that is very important especially for this movie. Try to understand what it delivers than what you want see. I mean prediction is okay, but don't assume in a wider aspect. The narration was so simple and you may think the end is so cliche, but the movie does not bother to provide a surprise. Before going to talk about the twist, you have clear a couple of things.

The first question you have to answer yourself is what is 'horror' mean to you. The demons? The ghosts? Other creepy creatures? The zombies? Possession and exorcism? Haunted places and objects? Imposter? You know 'terror' is also called 'horror', which is a very close to the 'thriller' than being an actual 'horror'. Different movies explain in a different way, but this movie is not that distinctive from those, except being unconventional in revealing the details related to the story and characters.

> ""I want you to repeat ten times
> that I'm your mother.""

This film had a few diversions in the name of the genre. That is the reason why it failed to satisfy the horror fans, but so much better without mentioning that around. You have to be careful from the beginning itself, observing closely every scene. Because the storytelling commences with a hint within the first 10 minutes which is equivalent to the twist. You must get it right, or the rest of the narration won't be interesting enough.

So it is a one time shot, for the second time watch it won't be that effective. Some people deny the casual twist that comes in the first act which is too early for them and so they expects one in the final section only to get disappointed. Nothing wrong with the audience getting annoyed, but the film being atypical, just changing the order of all the three acts, that's it. The writer wanted the viewers to keep guessing throughout the their watch. That's the twist in the filmmaking, not in the actual film. Other than that it was not a smartest movie with the turnovers to amaze or confuse you.

I mean it has a proper conclusion, and you would know what it is, but should have to wait for how it's going to take place. I have seen many guys criticising that part particularly, but I felt it was good and made the movie a better product. Definitely one of the best films of the year, especially in my perception. From the posters to the trailer and teaser to the movie, it was being truthful. Never intend to cheat you, except like I said if you assume the things to happen in your way. Specially a big NO to the fancy stuffs like graphics and high pitch sudden sound/noise that's very common in horror to scare you. If you are a Hollywood fanatic, you definitely miss those doses and blame the movie.

A great directional debut as well as the twins with the real names on-screen. It got some intense scares, but limits the grossness. Had less dialogues and more in acts. Pretty rare movie and I am surprised that the critics liked this film more than the movie fanatics. But I'm happy that I'm not one of those to dislike it being a movie buff. My only disappointment is the outro scene (the exit scene) (in Hollywood it for kissing) which comes after the conclusion and before the end credit (sometimes, along the credit). I strongly recommend it, and I hope you consider some of the points I wrote in this review, otherwise I barely recommend it.

310135,Frank Ochieng,"Now who would think that the kiddie-inspired, Science Fiction post-apocalyptic ‘Turbo Kid’ could motivate one’s appetite for nostalgic cheese-ridden action yarns? Well, the directing/writing trio of Francois Simard, Yoann-Karl Wissell and Anouk Wissell deliver the devilish gaudy goods in this frolicking futuristic fantasy that begs for audiences to reminisce about such off-beat and clichéd guilty pleasures that are so goofy-minded and gory but infectiously high-spirited for one’s disturbed liking.

Instinctively, ‘Turbo Kid’ looks to shrewdly ridicule the jolting junk cinema with its homage to such trashy treasures ranging from the lopsided likes of gems ‘The New Barbarians’ and 2019,  ‘After The Fall Of New York’ to even saluting high-minded 80’s roguish schlock such as the international cult favorite ‘The Road Warrior’. Fortified with kinetic kookiness and an off-kilter preference for its cockeyed convictions, ‘Turbo Kid’ generates an appealing penchant for cheeky outlandishness that we all relish in our taste for low-grade, salacious cinema.  

Astutely, ‘Turbo Kid’ sets out to do what it is compelled to do and that is to trigger the hungry imagination for yesteryear’s yearning for those gloriously cheapened, low-budgeted cornball capers that oddly registered with the fanboys’ appreciation for convoluted, sensationalistic big screen cheeseball escapism that this unruly genre provided on many occasions for the sanctioned unintentional chuckles.  The gruesome threesome of Simard and the Wissells refreshingly never shy away from the bombastic serving of violence and hokey-minded hedonism  that are the true trademark of throwaway entertainment at its finest.

As the lone wolf adolescent in the distant future of 1997, the orphaned Kid (‘Degrassi: The Next Generation’s Munro Chambers) survives in a tattered world defaced by ominous components of Mother Nature (namely acid rain) and the aftermath results of nuclear destruction. The existence for The Kid, frankly speaking, is bleak and nothing to write home about enthusiastically. Nevertheless, he keeps himself engaged with what he likes to do consistently whether it is chilling out in his bomb shelter-style quarters, riding freely on his BMX bike or browsing comic books–particularly his favorite issue of ‘Turbo Man’ .

Of course things become quite interesting for The Kid when he meets up with the ever-so-quirky Apple (Laurence Labeouf), a young woman whose strangeness and mysterious backstory becomes an attractive magnet for the soon-to-be daring hero. The opportunity arises for The Kid to show his heroic chops (much like his idol Turbo Man) when his galpal Apple’s safety is jeopardized by resident fiend Zeus (Michael Ironside). Not only does the diabolical Zeus kidnap Apple but looks to manipulate and dictate the region’s precious water supply. Naturally, this does not sit well with the miffed Kid as he already harbors resentment towards Zeus based on past unkind dealings with the Villainous One.

As luck would have it The Kid discovers what appears to be Turbo Man’s powered costume and arsenal of skills. Conveniently, this is enough to transform the youngster into a formidable force to take on the dastardly Zeus, restore the honor of the loopy Apple and save the day in general. Not too bad for a wandering cad that escaped his reality in a reliable comic book only to become a real-life comic book rescuer in the form of his worshiped mentor Turbo Man.

Sure, the mayhem and mockery is indeed over-the-top and as lame as the proceedings are in reality one still cannot stop from looking away. ‘Turbo Kid’, with its bloody wackiness in tow, toasts its creative absurdity proudly. The corrosive camp factor works because the mindset is geared for unapologetic subversion into a flagrant fantasy that wears its badge of debauchery with sordid honor. The exaggerated and bizarre displays of colorful chaos as drowned out in crazy-minded outfits, challenging bike chases, manufactured doom-and-gloom predicaments and the basic plodding of good versus evil make ‘Turbo Kid’ an ambitiously naughty and boisterous delight. Clearly, the filmmakers demonstrate their affinity for the aforementioned off-balanced furious-minded fluff of the 80s and early 90s that invaded video shelves the same way weary soldiers approached the unknown shores of Normandy.  Combative, unconventional and guaranteed to impale one’s exposed guts on a spiked iron fence ‘Turbo Kid’ is weird and wonderful if only for the afterglow of basking in the art of dimwitted decadence so lovingly realized in the not-so-forgettable impulsive retro flicks of shining shame from the years past.

It was made in the style of the 80s movie and the story sets in the future, that mean in the late 90s. If your childhood were the 90s, probably you would have seen plenty of the 80s sci-fi films and this one is dedicated to the fans of that era. Kind of semi-superhero movie like 'Super' and 'Defendor'. Other than that this film has nothing to do with 'New Kids Turbo' and its sequel 'Nitro' as I initially presumed it might the third in the series.

I thought it was a pretty cool flick, so much fun. Sort of replicates the recent 'Mad Max' film, but both the flicks came into the production at a same time and this one is not all about the chasing or even a road flick. So I think it just inspired by the previous trilogy from that franchise, where automobiles are replaced by the BMXes here. Kind of eco-friendly movie!

As the many post-apocalyptic themes depicted, this one as well prioritised about a regional conflict for the source of water. A territory where a ruthless man controlled it and he kills who pose a threat to his crown. There comes an act of revenge from a boy and a girl along a man who challenge him. Who's going to that win the battle is what the finale of the movie.

> ""A man never knows how strong he is
> until being strong is the only choice he has.""

The first impression was the movie is for all, especially for the kids, but once the action parts begin to take place, my stance has changed. There are no high-end stunts, but too much of blood and gore. Although, nothing was so serious, somehow keeps entertaining and sometimes slightly disgusting, but the momentum was held at a moderate pace throughout the film.

The character Apple was so sweet and cute who actually lifted the movie's spirit with her funny, bubbly part, but also disappoints to learn the what's her kind is. Pretty much she helped to bring faintly a romantic atmosphere around which I was not expected. A simple story and a simple twist with the good characters and the fine supporting visuals.

Definitely an above average, but still not that awesome, excepting it is very enjoyable for the first watch. The filmmakers were the quite newcomers, but proved enough with their abilities, under a limited budget to give an acceptable standard flick. If you are okay with the B flicks, then it won't upset you, except you are not familiar with those types. I think it will hit a cult status moving into the next decade and so on among the B movie fans.

Absolutely a kick-ass horror-comedy from the Kiwi. In a horror, usually we expect too much, particularly we calculate them according to how much it scares us. That's a tough job for the filmmaker, but when the comedy tag was attached to it which makes even tougher. In this kind of theme, very rarely people say they're satisfied enough and this is one of those. Yep, a surprise film written and directed by a newcomer. Since it is a New Zealand film, I don't anybody from it, but they all were excellent. Particularly the lead woman was unbelievably good, totally loved her, kind of reminds Nia Vardalos of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' fame and her expressions too matches for in this film.

The story was familiar, even some part of it can be compared to the recent film 'The Boy'. Likewise, other pieces from different films, but I did not care, because it still looked fresh of its own. The way it was developed contributed to the film's success and those suspense lived up to the hype that were made in the early stage of narration. The woman who won't get scared easily, finally meets her ultimate fear after returning to her mother's house where she grew up. But only to discover the house is haunted, followed by mysterious events and the final confrontation between her and whoever on the opposite.

Great setting with the awesome performances, and always keeps us on the edge. But the laughs were delivered in the form of black comedy. The twists and turns make the film to flip to the opposite side after reaching at one point of the narration leaving the viewers to judge how strongly it linked to its genre. But I don't think most of them care about that since they're already entertained and only going to witness the final thrilling conclusion. I hope there won't be any follow up, because this one-off film was one of the best from the down under, so I don't want it to be ruined, like they do in the Hollywood. Recommended, you will enjoy it even your rating does not meet what I've given.

52274,Matt Golden,"Twin sisters Julia and Sara (each played by Belén Rueda) both suffer from a degenerative eye disease that robs them of their sight; Sara lost her vision completely, and it’s only a matter of time before Julia’s sight follows. The film begins with the death of the blind Sara, apparently being menaced by someone in her home, then hanging herself. Details surrounding Sara’s death don’t add up for Julia, however; why would Sara kill herself? She was scheduled to have an operation to restore her sight, and she just met someone. Julia and her husband Isaac (Lluís Homar) begin to investigate, but time is running out: Sara may have been murdered, her danger is now turning toward Julia, and the added stress is stealing Julia’s remaining vision ever faster...

There are so many great concepts here. The most primary is blindness, and the terror it invokes. Our heroine knows the remaining time she has with her sight is short, and the agony she (and her husband) feels over its loss is palpable. Not content with the mundane horror of blindness, the film ups the ante by putting this woman with ever-dimming sight into a life-or-death struggle to discover what happened to her sister and prevent it from befalling her as well. Few horror films are able put their protagonist in such a nail-bitingly vulnerable position.

Even fewer horror films, however, have the terrific Belén Rueda anchoring them. Rueda’s performance is incredible, by turns vulnerable, heartbroken, terrified and full of steely resolve. She and Homar have a warm, believable chemistry that informs their performances as a married couple with a devastating disease hanging over their heads. Will he love her when she’s blind? Will he abandon her? He’s sick with worry over the stress and her imminent plunge into blindness. She’s driven by guilt to discover what happened to her sister, even knowing what it may cost her.

The film itself is a masterwork of tension and style, including some gorgeous and clever cinematography by Óscar Faura. This is indeed one of the most stylish thrillers I’ve ever seen, particularly a conceit that director Guillem Morales effects around the midway point and is clever, frustrating, and hideously effective. The film eschews (as all the best do) copious blood and gore, and milks the quiet horror of Julia’s predicament for everything it’s worth.

There are a couple of story beats high-concept enough they may raise your eyebrow after the fact, but when your film is this immaculately-crafted, this terrifying, this effective…who the hell cares? If you’re not on the edge of your seat by the time of the film’s hellishly tense finale, I fear you may require medical attention. Mystery, thriller, horror, character study…the film is all these things and more, blended into an arresting film experience that elicits a full catalog of fears ranging from the mundane to the Grand Guignol.

52274,CinemaSerf,"Failing eyesight runs in the family here as the blind ""Sara"" apparently takes her own life in the basement of her home, leaving sibling ""Julia"" (Belén Rueda) - herself with irreversible eye problems of her own - left to investigate just what happened. Everyone is convinced it was suicide, but not ""Julia"" and when she and husband ""Isaac"" (Lluís Homar) have to temporarily move into her sister's home she begins to piece together a puzzle that involves the specialist eye clinic they both attended, a mysterious boyfriend and some very sceptical police officers led by ""Dimas"" (Francesc Orella). The first hour of this is all pretty standard horror fayre, but once we've got past the character establishment and domestic squabbling stage, it turns into a decently menacing thriller with quite a compelling effort from Rueda as the increasingly panic-stricken character. Most of the sense of horror here is easily transferable to an audience if you shut your eyes and let your ears and the darkness do your petrifying for you. It's not for the squeamish either - needles, eyeballs, hospitals - not for the faint hearted! The end product here is an hybrid of a few styles and is hardly ground-breaking, but it benefits from taut direction at the end and a solidly fearful performance from a Rueda who looks as terrified as were were supposed to feel.

934433,The Movie Mob,"**Scream VI cranks up the violence, paranoia, and chaos but also enhances the character development and story, making the new directors' second entry even better than I had hoped!**

I have been hyped and anxiously anticipating this movie since the final moments of finishing Scream (2022) in theaters - and it did not disappoint! The Radio Silence team (Bettinnelli-Olpin and Gillett) prove they are the perfect new shepherds of the franchise. The four young survivors take giant leaps in character development as they grapple with the trauma, fallout, and spotlight of the last film's events. Their loyalty and care for each other draw immediate similarities to Sidney, Dewey, and Gale, which quickly endear the ""Core Four"" as beloved characters you desperately want to survive. The danger, kills, and gore all have been cranked up a notch, and for the first time in the franchise, even the survivors are possible Ghostfaces. I doubt and suspect everyone while simultaneously caring for them - that is masterful writing right there! On top of all that, having another legacy character back with Kirby Reed returning was fantastic. I loved this movie, but I really missed Dewey and Sidney. I also think the main Ghostface killer is a little too over the top when revealed, which keeps Scream (1996) and Scream (2022) ahead on my list. But those are incredibly minor complaints! Scream VI is another exceptional entry in the Scream franchise, and I hope we get another one soon!",2023-03-10T05:28:12.976Z,8.0,Scream VI,2023

While it is somewhat self-referential it is not nearly as much on that vibe as Scream V. Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett are back with the same knack for set pieces but they're even stepped up their game more! Each scenario is cleverly set up for maximum suspense and tension, then pays off with buckets of blood. There's a scene set on the subway that is especially hair-raising.

The women rule here -- Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega, and Jasmin Savoy Brown are totally believable and likable. It just goes to show that this franchise can survive and even thrive without the legacy characters.

""Scream VI is satisfying enough as another sequel. The new location and sets bring much-needed freshness to the franchise. The killings have never been this visually violent and gory, pushing the entertainment levels of a pretty fast-paced story. Melissa Barrera proves that she's capable of leading a film of this scale, but Jenna Ortega plays in a league of her own. Unfortunately, the third act is everything that it shouldn't be: predictable, forced, underwhelming, and incapable of bringing together all its meta commentary – lacking development, or a plot. One too many inconsistencies, even for a saga known for not taking itself seriously.""

934433,CinemaSerf,"Now I did approach this with some trepidation. I positively hated the puerile outing for ""Ghostface"" from last year. Still, it could hardly be much worse - and, as it happens, is actually really rather better. The plot still reminds me of something from an edition of ""Scooby Do"". The slasher manages to penetrate tight security; be in half a dozen places at one time; have access to secret phone numbers etc...; whilst those impaled appear to have a remarkable resilience for survival and recovery after an onslaught that would have felled an elephant. That's not the point, though. Unlike so many of the genre, this is actually quite scary and works well as a bit of a self-parody. If you've watched the others in the franchise, you will know how the dynamic plays out - and this is just an extension of that. The story doesn't really matter - it's the way in which the directors manage to imbue the whole thing with an entertaining degree of menace and paranoia, a few quite effective jump moments and by using a cast of relative non-entities (and by only using the wooden as a draining-board Courteney Cox sparingly), they manage to create a film that is actually a bit frightening at times. There are plenty of new characters for us to suspect including love interest Josh Segarra (""Danny"") - who reminded me of Christian Bale, and the rather hapless Jack Champion's (""Ethan"") before an ending that was, admittedly, quite ridiculous! This is not a film that will engage your brain on any level, but as piece of well constructed entertainment with some frequently quite witty dialogue and an eye watering encounter between a boy and a taser - it's well worth catching up with.",2023-03-23T14:33:22.637Z,7.0,Scream VI,2023
934433,Nathan,"Scream VI is bloodier and more gruesome than its predecessor, but that does not make up for an average plot and rushed first act.

This movie is a tale of two halves for me. The first half was pretty messy, with a lot of new characters introduced and events taking place across multiple different locations. The New York setting created a multitude of interesting set pieces, but the spanning locations result in the movie being slightly unfocused at times. The film rushed through this introduction, which resulted in poor pacing. The second half was an intense, paranoia-inducing sequence that had me on the edge of my seat. As a whole, the movie worked well but could have been much better.

The best parts about Scream VI are the characters and the action. All of our returning cast is fantastic, and their chemistry works so well together. They are so great on screen that I feel as though the film does not really need the legacy characters, as they seem somewhat unnecessary. Our new cast members do fine in their roles, but they are not nearly as interesting as our core four. But that is fine in a slasher, as their role is to be carved up by Ghostface. This film is especially brutal, with some particularly gruesome kills and fantastic effects work to show the remains of our victims. There are a few kills that were top-notch and will go down as some of my favorites in the franchise. Scream VI is the first film for me that genuinely had me stressed. There are a few scenes that just linger for a moment too long and create an unsettling feeling in me that I thought worked really well. My favorite scene was the subway sequence, as my heart was pounding for genuinely two minutes straight.

Other than the rushed first act, my only complaint has to do with the ending and some of the unbelievability in terms of our cast's survival. Although I do not think the final reveal was as bad as most reviewers make it out to be, I still think it could have been slightly better. I had one killer pegged from the beginning, but the other was a surprise, so I think they did a good job keeping the audience in the dark. Our characters take quite the beating in this film, with some being stabbed nearly a dozen times and still somehow being able to survive. It isn’t a huge deal, but it did take me out of the film a bit. Also, I spent nearly ten minutes of the movie trying to figure out how the hell Kirby was alive; I could have sworn she died in Scream 4.

Overall, Scream VI was a welcomed addition to the franchise, even if it was not as good as Scream (2022). I do think my expectations were a bit high from the initial reactions, which may have led me to being slightly let down.

At the start, the main character walks up to some guy and says 'I'm gonna taze you in the balls', and does so. Instead of spending the rest of the movie in a jail cell on sexual assault charges, and then getting sued into the ground, the film just goes on. (The victim was a white male, so modern hollywood wants you to think it's 'funny' rather than disgusting.) From that point on, the main character is in no way an innocent victim, so it's hard to care that she's being pursued by a killer. The plot is mediocre, there are no funny or cool characters that the viewer might actually care about, and the killer's identity has reached the level of 'roommate's friend's brother's dogwalker', aka 'who cares'.

I felt similarly about 2022's <em>'Scream'</em>, in that the legacy ones are solid though the newcomers just lack any sort of conviction with their performances, in my eyes anyway. Jenna Ortega is the only one I named as decent in the predecessor, however even she isn't all that in this 2023 release unfortunately.

Melissa Barrera is OK but forgettable, Dermot Mulroney overacts by chewing the heck out of the scenery and the rest of the friends circle range from boring to irritating. I don't intend to hate on them too much as I actually don't dislike them, it's just they consistently stopped me from getting into the movie.

...and that's a shame, as its other elements are quite good. The visual use of Ghostface is effective, the music plays well (on that note - big fan of Demi Lovato's end credits song, as I was for last year's film from Salem in fairness... they know how to pick 'em!) and, most importantly, the kills are actually awesome; fwiw, they help boost up my rating.

800815,Nathan,"The Pale Blue Eye had great performances, fantastic cinematography, and a decent story but fails in terms of pacing and a bloated runtime that did not feel warranted.

Christian Bale is fantastic in this role. He is incredibly intense, being able to capture the seriousness of his detective work balanced with the emotions of his unfortunate tragedies in life. A performance of this caliber is expected of Bale, but what was a surprise is the standout performance of Harry Melling. Melling was whimsical and tad odd with his portrayal of the famous Edgar Allen Poe. He legitimately stole every scene he was, including the ones with Bale.

The film was quite long and drawn out. The beginning act did fine as the audience is still learning the world and the crimes committed. But after that wears off it begins to drag going into a climatic third act. A lot of this bloat could have been cut down to create a better viewing experience. That being said, I did enjoy the story of this film. It was engaging and had some twists that I think worked pretty well, although the ending did leave me with a few questions.

A mass epidemic strikes Earth which makes people go crazy and commit suicide, but only IF they are not blindfolded and SEE the mysterious phenomena. A group of Californians find succor in an abode with covered windows. One woman (Sandra Bullock) and two children try to make it down a remote river to find sanctuary, blindfolded. Trevante Rhodes and John Malkovich costar. 

“Bird Box” (2018) is a post-apocalyptic survival adventure/horror with an original concept and elements of flicks like “The Book of Eli” (2010), “The Mist” (2007), “Carriers” (2009) and “Stake Land” (2010). The reason for the apocalypse is what makes “Bird Box” standout and, thankfully, there are no zombies, yet it’s the least of these for a couple of reasons.

For one, I didn’t find the dramatic dynamics of the group all that captivating, but it was okay. If you’re a fan of Bullock you’ll probably like this movie more than me. I appreciated Rosa Salazar as Lucy, but her role isn’t that significant. Meanwhile Rhodes and Malkovich are effective.

The concept behind the mass crisis is where the movie fails. It’s sort of explained and yet it isn’t. There are too many inconsistencies and what appears to be plot holes. It’s basically a bunch of malarkey and reflects lazy writing. People on message boards debate back-and-forth ad nauseam, but the movie’s too nonsensical and meh to make it worth the effort.

I have technical frustrations with this movie, but it's premise alone is interesting enough that anyone interested in survival style movies should watch it, though I'm not sure how many people are re-watching this.

The movie is cast very well: Sandra Bullock and Jon Malkovich, both wonderfully portray jerk characters in completely different lights, along side several supporting actors who all deliver adequately or better.

As most of the movie takes place inside a single house, they manage to keep things interesting there and vary up a few select locations, to include a city that is amazingly detailed in all the chaos unfurling and a river that is somehow both expanse enough you could feel lost and also claustrophobic in its restriction: it's a movie that presents very well.

My big qualm is the structure of the writing: not the writing itself.  All the dialogue and story arcs are great, but the RIDICULOUS insistence on re-ordering a story and not benefiting from it is just annoying.

The second half of the story is interspersed with the first half of the story so you alternate back and forth.  Really, who tells a story and jumps ahead 3/5 of the way, then back, then when you get to the 3/5 mark, not reiterate what is happening there.

405774,Alunauwie,"Bird Box, adapted from Josh Malerman’s novel, presents a chilling premise of an invisible entity that drives people to suicide upon seeing it. The film uses a dual-timeline narrative effectively, balancing present danger with the origin of the chaos. While the internal group conflicts and tension are well-handled, the logic behind the creature’s effects and selective immunity leaves some ambiguity. Strong performances, especially from Sandra Bullock, and detailed direction enhance the film’s impact. Though intriguing, the film leaves room for deeper exploration of its mythos and psychological depth.

381283,jessetaylor,"This film defies being rated on a scale of 1 through 5 - it's truly almost impossible to do so. I want to rate this a 5 and I want to rate this a 3 at the same time. Both would be wrong though so I'll just settle in the middle. Aronofsky has given us many brainsick films in the past, but this is on a whole other level. Remember the batshit crazy climax of _Requiem for a Dream_? Multiply that by 50 and you get the batshit crazy climax of mother! - and that is a *huge* understatement.

I don't really want to talk too much about the film's plot or the finale as not much about the film is known to the public at this point. It's absolutely worth it to go into this film as blind as possible or maximum effectiveness. All I'll say is that the _Rosemary's Baby_ influenced poster and marketing so far is a big curve ball - it has nothing to do with that film although Polanski horror elements are clearly an inspiration to Aronofsky here.

I do want to praise three specific elements of this film that worked the best for me: (1) The sound design was absolutely magnificent. There is no score to this film - not quite sure what Jóhann Jóhansson did here - but the sound design is eerie as hell and supremely memorable. (2) The production design is next level. The house in this film is basically the co-lead (you'll see what I mean when you watch it) and it evolves drastically over the course of the film (again, you'll see what I mean when you watch it). Excellent art direction that I haven't stopped thinking about all day. (3) The performance from Jennifer Lawrence is harrowing as she really gave herself to this film and to Aronofksy's vision, but the performance that stuck with me is the one from Michelle Pfeiffer. She really embodied her character and even though she's only in maybe the first 60% of the film, she left a deep impression on the rest of it as well. Her character is crucial to the film and she injected such mystery and gravity to the events that followed her exit.

Jennifer Lawrence is great, as is Javier Bardem. Those two are very much the stars of the film, though you also have Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer in noteworthy roles. Excellent casting for all four. The film, meanwhile, looks superb, from the effects to the cinematography.

It kind of lies to you and really hate it when movies try to pass themselves off as more than they actually are.

You can't blame the actors here, it's all the director and the studio. They wanted controversy, they wanted drama, they wanted critical praise and the wanted people to talk about it....

...but in the end, it's a home invasion movie and it wouldn't have had any of what the studio and the director wanted if they just made an honest film.

But then, if they were honest about what they were making, it probably would have done better, it would have made more money. People wouldn't have been so confused about it, the critics would have panned the hell out of it and ten years down the line it may have had a cult following.

A renowned poet and his much younger wife (Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem) live in a huge old house in the sticks. He has writer’s block while she’s restoring the house after a fire. When unannounced strangers show up (including Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer), it naturally has a negative effect on the beautiful woman and her world.    

“Mother!” (2017) was helmed by Darren Aronofsky, who’s known for artsy stuff like “Requiem for a Dream” and “The Fountain,” but he’s perfectly capable of doing more conventionally entertaining flicks, like “The Wrestler.” This one falls in the former category, although the first act is fairly conventional and compelling in the manner of, say, “What Lies Beneath” or “Cold Creek Manor.” 

Yet it gets increasingly incomprehensible and tedious. You could say it starts like a Roman Polanski film, in particular “Cul-de-sac” and “Rosemary’s Baby,” but ends with the surrealism of Luis Buñuel. You’re thinking maybe home invasion à la “Desperate Hours” before the proceedings become unfathomable. Part of the fun of a movie like this is trying to figure out the symbolism and meaning. In this case, you’ll need to be up on biblical material and ecology, otherwise you’ll be lost.

So, I’m in the middle on this unique work. It’s professionally made, Jennifer is beautiful in her prime, it begins interesting enough, and the themes are unforgettable but, as a standard viewing experience, it gets dull and annoying. I never want to see it again, yet I’ll probably be pondering the metaphors the rest of my life. I respect it, but can only recommend it to those who are intrigued. It's not for everyone. 

The movie runs 2 hours, 1 minute, and was shot in Montréal and Québec.

8413,Matt Golden,"In the year 2040, a spacecraft called the Event Horizon was sent out to journey among the stars with an experimental gravity drive that purported to allow faster-than-light travel. On its maiden voyage, however, it vanished. Seven years later, it has returned, orbiting Neptune, and a rescue crew is sent out to investigate, along with the scientist responsible for the ship’s creation. The rescue crew of the Lewis and Clark are a group of no-nonsense blue-collar workers, led by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), with Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) along for his expertise. When they arrive at the Event Horizon, they find the crew long dead. “This ship is a tomb,” judges Captain Miller at one point. The rescue team begins to realize that the ship passed through a black hole created by the gravity drive, but didn’t return alone. The ship with a long-dead crew shows life signs. The rescue team begins to have terrifying visions. The gravity drive begins to spin of its own accord...

Something is loose on the ship, and the rescue team has to not only unravel out what happened to the original crew, but also protect themselves from the horrors that returned with the ship. It’s a simple but sturdy setup, standard B-movie stuff. What elevates Event Horizon is its first-class production design and solid atmosphere. Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, Alien vs. Predator) is not a name one would generally associate with good film product these days, but here he managed (in spite of himself, one may think given the rest of his output) to present a film steeped in suspense, with strong performances, gorgeous set pieces, and palpable horror.

Let’s be honest: there’s nothing new here. The strength of this film lies in how it fits together the pieces it stole from other films. This is very much (and very completely) The Shining by way of Alien, even to the point of lifting the character archetypes directly from Ridley Scott’s 1979 masterpiece. The Event Horizon is the Overlook Hotel, teeming with supernatural power and malice. The film delves into gore in its last third, but it’s not quite proficient enough to have it enhance the scares (which were doing just fine before the blood started flowing so freely). However, the film is even structured like Alien and The Shining, all slow burn and building dread until things begin to go to hell (literally, perhaps). The cast have stock characters but they bring them to life admirably, particularly Neill and Fishburne; among the secondary characters, Kathleen Quinlan, Jack Noseworthy, and Sean Pertwee are particularly memorable. The script by Philip Eisner is derivative but effective, and Anderson was clearly at the peak of his directorial prowess here. Don't misunderstand me to say that the film's lifts from other works make it bad; it's certainly not. Originality is overrated as an attribute, and fairly value-neutral even on the best of days. I'd much rather have a tale well-told than one that does weird things simply for the sake of doing weird things (French sci-fi/fantasy directors, I'm looking at you. Yes, you, Jeunet), though the greatest films find a way to combine both sturdy storytelling and originality in the medium. In total, Event Horizon is a very effective sci-fi horror film, breaking no new ground but doing what it does very well. A minor classic of the sci-fi horror genre.",2013-07-21T18:25:36.178Z,,Event Horizon,1997
8413,John Chard,"You know nothing. Hell is only a word. The reality is much, much worse. 

Event Horizon is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and written by Philip Eisner. It stars Sam Neil, Laurence Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan, Richard T. Jones, Sean Pertwee, Jason Isaacs and Jack Noseworthy. Music is by Michael Kamen and orbital and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle.  

2047 and a group of astronauts are sent to investigate the 'Event Horizon' which disappeared mysteriously 7 years ago. It has returned minus its crew and now the crew of the 'Lewis and Clark' become exposed to horrifying secrets of the ghost ship...

It is what it is, a haunted house chiller set on a space ship. It's derivative within the genre but it does the genre staples with no little amount of quality. The tone is set from the opening credits being accompanied by a ferociously foreboding musical score, and from there the pic delivers a ""who is going to get killed and in what order"" process - and why? Just what is the mystery at the core of it all?.

A great cast has been assembled, which lifts it above its ""B"" movie roots, so with some thoughtful ideas within the narrative, it's easy to buy into the characterisations. Naturally the blood will flow, devilishly so, but the makers here put a different slant on the sci-fi/horror assailant thread. Of course it gets a bit by the numbers come the final quarter, arguably a bit hokey in fact, but it's very effective and perfect for a lights off viewing experience.

Smart production design helps keeps up the chilly feel to proceedings, whilst the bleak tonal flows that director Anderson goes for really draws the engaged observer in. It's neither ground breaking or a top line film of its type, but holding up on repeat viewings it proves to be a sturdy and unsettling space based chiller. 7/10",2019-10-02T07:33:51.593Z,7.0,Event Horizon,1997

8413,RalphRahal,"""Event Horizon"" is one of those movies that pulls you in with its eerie atmosphere and keeps you hooked with its intriguing premise. It’s a sci-fi horror that isn’t just about space exploration but dives into darker, more psychological territory. The visuals are haunting, the tension builds steadily, and the overall design of the ship itself adds so much to the unsettling vibe. From start to finish, the movie keeps you on edge, and the pacing ensures you’re never bored.

What I really appreciate about ""Event Horizon"" is its ability to blend genres so seamlessly. It’s a sci-fi film at its core, but the horror elements are front and center, creating an experience that feels fresh and unique. The story is easy to follow, which makes the intense moments hit even harder. You’re not trying to untangle a complicated plot; you’re just along for the ride, which makes it even more effective when things start to unravel.

While it could have benefited from a bit more character development to really drive that emotional connection, the film still manages to leave a lasting impression. It’s the kind of movie that grows on you the more you think about it. If you’re into suspenseful, atmospheric films that mix horror with sci-fi, ""Event Horizon"" is definitely worth checking out.

833339,Nathan,"_Speak No Evil_ is an eerily realistic horror film that created incredible tension with the simplest interactions. Each incident escalates beyond comfortability leaving the family with the option of politeness or confrontation, with them choosing the former the entire movie. The scenes create a sense of awkwardness, where the audience is begging the family to remove themselves from the situation, but they remain. This is positive and a negative for the film. These choices the family make kept me engaged to see what happens next. But at the same time, it was incredibly frustrating to see baffling character choices be the vehicle for the plot. Despite that fact, the tension is built and remains throughout the runtime. Even though this movie had periods where it was quite slow, they never stayed for long without another problem being added to the list. I enjoyed it, but there are pacing problems that restricted me from being fulling ingulfed in the film.

And Based on my criteria, this movie is 10/10! This movie actually traumatized me.

There was no Rotten Tomatoes and I didn't read reviews back then so I went in blind. And I utterly enjoyed the movie: the story, the action sequences, the underground ""Hive,"" Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez kicking serious ass, and more. 

Panned by critics (36% RT) but liked by users (67% RT), Resident Evil was one of the first examples of how mainstream critics just don't ""get"" horror. Movies that try to be artsy get great reviews even as key elements fall flat for the rest of us. The recent ""Beach House"" is a perfect example of this -- it was loved by critics (81% RT) and panned by users (28%).

1576,RalphRahal,"Resident Evil (2002) is a solid action-horror film that takes the core idea of the video game series and spins it into something original. The plot is simple but effective, following a group trying to survive in a high-tech underground facility after a deadly outbreak. It doesn't just rely on zombies for tension; the movie builds suspense through corporate secrecy, AI threats, and bioengineered monstrosities. The blend of sci-fi elements with action and horror keeps things engaging from start to finish, making it stand out from traditional zombie flicks.

Paul W.S. Anderson’s directing gives the film a sleek, fast-paced energy that keeps the tension high. The cinematography complements this with clean, stylized shots, making the action sequences crisp and easy to follow. The laser hallway scene is one of the film’s most iconic moments, showcasing both the film's brutal efficiency and its sci-fi horror tone. The set design, particularly The Hive, feels sterile and claustrophobic, adding to the atmosphere. The action choreography is sharp, and Milla Jovovich’s presence elevates the film. She delivers a strong performance, blending vulnerability and badassery in a way that makes Alice instantly likable.

The script keeps things moving at a good pace, avoiding unnecessary exposition while letting the mystery unfold naturally. Some of the dialogue is straightforward, but it fits the film’s tone, prioritizing momentum over complexity. The score, co-composed by Marilyn Manson, adds a heavy, industrial edge that enhances the movie’s aggressive, cyberpunk feel. Overall, Resident Evil is a fun mix of action, horror, and sci-fi that still holds up, especially if you enjoy fast-paced, stylish survival thrillers.",2025-02-02T22:31:11.261Z,8.0,Resident Evil,2002

This kind of films is usually low rated by me. It's very rare that I find one good film and that happened to be this one.

Another home invasion film. A family reunites for the parent's wedding anniversary at their rural vacation house. Slowly all the children arrive with their life partners, and then suddenly while dining, the attack takes place. Creates full of chaos, the family does not know what to do. But one of the members' retaliation makes thing complication for the attackers. What follows after that, and how it all ends are the rest of the story.

First of all, this is not a horror film as labelled. It is a terror. We don't have a such genre, so it comes under horror. But the best way to call it a thriller. Sharni Vinson was very good. It's because of how her role was designed. Best film so far by this filmmaker, until his upcoming big titles. A one-night-event film, and of course a limited cast. They make sequels for crap films, but this one definitely deserves one. So I'm expecting one. Thos who love this genre must see it.

Bloody and bloody good fun!

The Davison family and partners meet up for a family reunion at a remote holiday home and quickly find that their inner issues are the least of their worries.

The splinter of horror that encompasses home invasion, that most terrifying of subject matters, has had enough filmic entries to actually fill a house! So when another one comes along with good hype and a promise of reinvigorating the formula, it's cause for horror film fans to start salivating.

You're Next doesn't reinvent anything, but it consistently and confidently keeps the formula well oiled and proves to be one of the better films of its type. The set up is standard, a big old country house in the woods, a whole bunch of likable and dislikable people, and of course some outside assailants about to unleash hell on everyone in the house. Refreshingly this is not a roll call of pretty teenagers being stalked and slashed, this is an assorted bunch, young and old, all shapes and sizes, and the family bickering that precedes the carnage is a smart move, because once family members start getting killed there's a genuine sense of grief and regret coursing through those yet to be sliced and diced.

It's nice to find that Wingard has great respect for his target audience, he's made a film for fans of the sub-genre and inserted a darkly comic streak that pays off royally. It's often very nudge nudge and wink winkery, but always in the right places. The director also proves to have a devilish eye for a murder scene, with some of the killings here high grade in blood, physicality and originality. Elsewhere the makers give us a great heroine, a truly resourceful gal that fights back with a ferocity that's both sexy and frightening, and while the revelation of why these events are happening is hardly original - or that the back story given for our heroine's skills is just silly - Wingard plonks it all together with such bloody verve it hardly matters.

Some less than good acting from a couple of the cast, and the overuse of shaky-cam stops it from going through the roof out into the genius stratosphere, but this is a cracker of a home invasion horror and well worth a night in with the lights off and the volume tuned up loud. 8/10",2018-10-28T01:02:46.985Z,8.0,You're Next,2011
83899,Gimly,"**The following is a long-form review that I originally wrote in 2013.**

Though initially shown in 2011, You're Next has only just gained a theatrical release in the past month. A release for which I'm very glad. Being in Australia, a horror movie in cinema is not common, there's rarely if ever more than two showing at the same time, and very often none.

Stylistically it blends a lot of cliche business with some much more out there and alternative ideas. The cinematography is not unlike that of The Strangers (plus there's some similarity in events) and the vibe reminded me of the Saw franchise (though the events themselves most certainly did not). The result is a film that is oddly both a predictable and completely atypical horror.

Though the most major of the plot twists was seen coming by everyone I saw You're Next with, and personally only one of my many predictions about the film failed to eventuate, I'd still rate it as Adam Wingard's best work to date (who has previously been responsible for on A Horrible Way to Die, Pop Skull and What Fun We're Having as well as collaborative segments The ABCs of Death and both V/H/S entries).

The cast is small, and not exactly overburdened with big names. In fact I only recognised AJ Bowen out of the lot of them (from his work on other Wingard pieces as well as The Signal and Hatchet II). Sharni Vinson who plays a character named Erin (a twist on the Final Girl trope usually seen in slasher films) was unknown to me, though an Australian in a major role of an American film was cool to see. She earned much praise for her portrayal, though personally I felt this was at least as much (if not more so) due to good writing than good acting.

My personal accolades go to the villains of the piece, dubbed simply Fox Mask, Tiger Mask and Lamb Mask (above). Particularly Fox Mask, but that may well be a bias seeing as Hoyts sent me a Fox Mask Mask for free. As well as tickets. Good kids.

You're Next has some new ideas to display, as well as some class act ways of getting around issues like budget constraints. It has some well designed kills, a mostly-engaging story and some absolutely hilarious moments (probably intentional, but laugh-out-loud funny either way). But it didn't blow me away, nor was it groundbreaking. The ""new stuff"" brought to the table tended to come about in short bursts through an otherwise standard setting, rather than actually being original overall. I enjoyed my time and I'd recommend giving it a a watch, but ultimately it sat in the category of ""good"" rather than ""memorable"".

83899,r96sk,"It has a lot going for it, but the parts that aren't quite so positive drag it down a lot.

The horror aspects of <em>'You’re Next'</em> are good. All the deaths are pretty neat, with the villains certainly look the part. Sharni Vinson is memorable in the lead role of Erin, but she's really the only cast member that I enjoyed in this.

The set-up, character decisions and ultimate twist are dreadful. I have a decent threshold of ignoring when characters do dumb things, but this film takes the biscuit in that regard. I was questioning so much of what they all do, to the point it got irritating. Some of the editing and camera work isn't great either.

Going back to the cast. Vinson is definitely the best person onscreen, her character turns into a very cool one as the film progresses. With that said, I never felt she fitted in well. Vinson as Erin as a film's sole protagonist would be awesome, but she's unfortunately held back a lot in this.

I guess if you want a 95 minute slasher that doesn't take any thinking or anything of the sort, then this is a film that's worth a watch. However, for me, the supporting elements aren't good enough to match the solid horror.",2020-10-29T22:15:32.728Z,6.0,You're Next,2011

The true stand-out that makes You’re Next so much more interesting than any other slasher is that the female lead is not a stereotypical inept final girl but a strong, capable survivalist, much more than the killers bargained. You’re Next is brutal, gore-filled, and dark but satisfies by turning many horror stereotypes on their head with characters actually making some intelligent decisions in a slasher movie!

83899,Nathan,"You’re Next is a classic slasher film that has brutal kills and suspense, but suffers with a lackluster story and disappointing performances.

The story here is pretty generic with a group of unknown assailants brutally invading a home. There are some twists that the writers attempt to put into it, but most of them are pretty predictable and lack any serious shock.The plot uses the same trope that is used in countless horror films of our lead character luckily having some type of background training that allows her to be able to expertly defend herself. It is fine, but there is something terrifying about seeing an everyday person being thrown into these scenarios.

The performances are pretty bad across the board. Sharni Vinson does a great job and really carries the film overall. The mother and father are simply terrible. Every line delivered by them feels forced and uncomfortable. The other performances are all okay, but really do not make an impact at all.

Overall, my enjoyment of this film is heavily swayed by the gore, violence and suspense present throughout the entire runtime. There are some brutal scenes that had me verbally gasping, which is always a treat to have in a slasher film. Despite my complaints, there is enough here to find enjoyment and with a runtime of only 94 minutes, I would recommend this to any slasher fan.

Herrington High School, just your everyday place of learning. That is until the teachers start behaving strangely. It seems there is an alien plot to take over the world and only a rag-tag group of students can save us!

When you pair Robert Rodriguez (director) and Kevin Williamson (writer) what sort of movie do you really think you are going to get? Well the answer is The Faculty, which in all honesty holds absolutely no surprises for anyone familiar with the guys who gave us From Dusk Till Dawn & Scream respectively. That's not to say that The Faculty isn't a fun horror/sci-fi film, because it absolutely is, it's just should be noted that The Faculty is all that it can be as regards the makers and the nature of the genre beast.

The film has rightly been tagged as a cross between Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and any teen led Highschool movie (you can add Invaders From Mars in the mix too), this is intentional, something that's apparent since our intrepid students discuss ""Snatchers"" amongst other movie references, and one of them, Stokely (Clea Duval), is a sci-fi aficionado . As things progress it's also evident that the makers here are movie fans making a movie for movie fans, all be it one aimed solely at the teenage demographic. There's much satire around and cliché's are widely embraced, but again it works because there is no hidden agenda. There's gore and hugely effective scenes involving blood, slugs, heads and an eyeball, whilst slasher fans are catered for in a couple of - if seemingly pointless as regards the alien's intentions - memorable scenes.

The youngsters in the cast, all purposely playing total stereotypes, all do what is required, with Josh Hartnett, Duval & Elijah Wood particularly shining. Yet it's with the adult actors that The Faculty really gains its tongue in cheek momentum. Robert Patrick, Famke Jansen, Salma Hayek, Piper Laurie, Bebe Neuwirth and even Jon Stewart all file in for a bit of alien parasitical fun. Come the end of the mania, with the staple alien queen reveal and showdown, there's the overriding feeling that the film could have been so much more. Certainly it's guilty of being a touch too derivative, where a little focus has been lost in the self referential and knowing in-jokery genre winks. But ultimately it's a groovy ride is this one, not in the least bit serious, but one to clip open a tin of beer with and embrace it for what it certainly is. Entertaining sci-fi alien invasion hokum. 7/10",2019-07-15T06:38:54.266Z,7.0,The Faculty,1998
9276,Wuchak,"_**Wannabe edgy high school horror satire with a notable cast**_

Several students at a high school in Ohio suspect that the faculty has been taken over by some… thing(s). 

""The Faculty"" (1998) was directed by Robert Rodriguez, who knows how to make slick, ‘cool’ horror flicks, as witnessed in “From Dusk Till Dawn” (1996) and “Planet Terror” (2007). “The Faculty” is cut from the same cloth except it goes too far over-the-top in its wannabe edgy depiction of high school life in Middle America, to the point that it can only be viewed as a satire or black comedy. This turned me off the first time I watched it but, if you roll with it, you can enjoy the movie to some degree.

The story doesn’t become compelling until the second half when a group of students team-up to tackle the unbelievable situation. It’s basically “The Hidden” (1987) set in a high school environment.

Laura Harris is the top female, although the overrated Jordana Brewster is also on hand, as well as Clea DuVall. Bebe Neuwirth looks great as the principal while Salma Hayek plays a nurse, but not enough is done with her (don’t expect the dance sequence of “From Dusk Till Dawn”). Meanwhile Famke Janssen appears as an intimidated teacher that has an entertaining metamorphosis.

On the other side of the gender spectrum, Shawn Hatosy is notable as the main protagonist; Josh Hartnett too as a chemical-obsessed older student. Robert Patrick from “Terminator 2” plays the vein-popping coach while Jon Stewart has a small role.	

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in East Texas as follows: Austin (Herrington High School), Lockhart (high school parking lot, football field & town exteriors) and San Marcos.

450465,garethmb,"It is hard to believe it has been 19 years since “Unbreakable” arrived in cinemas as the film seemed to setup a sequel but it did not look like it would come to fruition. That all changed in 2016 when “Split” arrived and shocked audiences with a late reveal that showed a connection to the film. Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan has wasted no time in bringing the new film to fans with the arrival of “GLASS”.  The film picks up soon after the events of “Split” as The Horde embodied by 23 personalities in the form of Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) continues to kidnap young girls to serve to his highly dangerous 24th personality The Beast.

Security expert David Dunn (Bruce Willis) along with the help of his son attempts to locate the Horde as a new group of girls has gone missing.  In time David locates The Beast and the two clash; but end up captured by authorities and sent to a facility for evaluation.

Their captive Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) believes their special abilities are in their minds and that they really do not have the special abilities they believe they do. Each of them have a special cell designed to restrain them as David is under threat of being doused with water while Kevin has a series of strobes which will halt him and trigger a new personality.

Added to the mix is Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who has been at the facility under heavy sedation after the events of “Unbreakable”.

As the therapy unfolds it becomes clear that an elaborate game of cat and mouse is underway between Price and her charges as each seems to have their own agenda.  This all builds to a very unusual final act which left me pondering if I enjoyed the final result or was disappointed with it.

The film seems to slowly be building to a big finale but yet it is far more restrained than one would expect. The film has a constant theme of Super Heroes and their traditional stories and roles as well as that of their Super Villains. 

One expects a massive Battle Royale complete with elaborate FX but the film takes a more restrained approach and in doing so may disappoint some fans while pleasing others. The film naturally has its twist moments and while I will not spoil it, I can say I predicted it before I even saw the film. When I saw “Split” I actually told my wife my theory and low and behold it was true. I also predicted the twists for many of Shyamalan’s previous films so I had hoped for a bit more in this regard. The film does offer up some interesting options for another sequel or Spin-Off and the cast was very good especially McAvoy who adds to his menagerie of characters by showing audiences a few more of the ones previously undisclosed.

The film is at times very enjoyable and at times a bit frustrating as it seems to deviate from themes and elements that were setup earlier. That being said it does very much appear that this could indeed be just the start of something much bigger in the series.

450465,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

You all know how anxious I was about this movie. I’m a huge fan of Shyamalan, and I know how hard it is to try to defend a director who made The Last Airbender. Every time I offer undeniable proof of masterful filmmaking, I get overwhelmed with questions about his absurd twists and his cringe-worthy dialogues. Shyamalan is a bit like Kevin, he also has different personalities, depending on the films he releases. On one side, he is a phenomenal filmmaker who knows his craft better than anyone and who once was nicknamed “the second Spielberg”. A screenwriter who delivers mind-blowing plot twists and extremely captivating dialogue scenes. On the other side, there’s a guy who ruins entire movies with frustrating twists that no one asked for and with arguably horrible decisions regarding his characters. So, to each side does Shyamalan tends to in Glass?

The first act is seamless. I love how David is introduced 19 years later and how his life is now. Kevin continues to abduct impure teenage girls, and after a few minutes in, we get the first confrontation between our hero and villain. I wasn't expecting an action-heavy film, and I'm glad it isn't because it would ruin the tone of the other movies. This was never intended to be a massive finale with epic CGI fights, like a Marvel or DC installment. If you're one of those people who expected Glass to be an Infinity War-ish film, I don't even know why are you reading this because you have no idea what this trilogy is about.

Sarah Paulson portrays Dr. Ellie Staple, and she is responsible for treating people who think they are superheroes. So, the second act revolves around a fascinatingly engaging yet overlong narrative which leaves the main characters (and the audience) doubting if everything they did was a product of their supposedly damaged minds. There is so much to love and hate throughout this act. The interactions between these characters are as captivating as they could be, and I couldn't take my eyes off screen. Then, there's James McAvoy ... I have no words to describe how astonishing his performance is. Portraying one character is hard. Portraying almost 20 characters is just outrageous! However, McAvoy nails each personality delivering himself to his roles in such an unbelievable way. Sometimes I chuckled because I couldn't understand how it was possible an actor being able to do what he did, several times, in one-take sequences.

Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson return to portray David and Mr. Glass, respectively. The former is solid, and the respect he has for his character is evident. However, David is sort of left aside in this movie, but I'll get there. SLJ, even with less screentime than the other two, has more to do, regarding moving the plot forward. He gives an extraordinary performance, as expected from such a capable actor. During this act, these four characters offer a lot of memorable scenes, but the narrative is filled with exposition, and it overextends its stay. Shyamalan wanted to show everyone that he knows what he is writing about and a lot of times he used his characters to explicitly say, well, everything the audience needed to know, without any need to.

The third act is where everyone is going to either love or hate the film. In this genre, we all know that the ""middle ground"" is non-existent. Either you're part of the group who loves it and you will defend it at all costs, or you're part of the group who hates everything about it just due to its final moments. There is more than one Shyamalan twist during this final act. Truth is, I left a bit disappointed. It doesn't matter what your expectations are, it doesn't matter your preferences, at least one of the twists is always going to upset you. What disappoints me the most is that I don't really love any of them. Unbreakable has a final plot twist that completely changes its whole story, and it comes out of nowhere. It's literally mind-blowing! Split has the 17-year twist of it being part of the former's universe, which made several audiences in festivals give it a stand ovation. Glass has ... a bunch of twists. Period. There are no OH-MY-GOD-like reactions. There are no jaws dropped.

Instead, we are left with an arguably questionable decision. A couple of the twists are fine. I would even call them ""good twists"". However, the one that changes everything feels incredibly forced and most of all, it falls short for such a highly-anticipated trilogy's last installment. I can't help but wonder ""is this really the best path you could have chosen Shyamalan? Of all the endings you imagined, this is the one you think is the best to finish a 19-year-in-the-making superhero trilogy?"" Regarding the screenplay and the characters, I have the issue above and one associated with David Dunn. If Split didn't have that final twist, it would be a good thriller. Way above average, but not astounding. The link to Unbreakable's universe is what makes it a standout movie of 2017. So, I was expecting a lot of David, and I only got a small fraction of him.

I'll put this way:
- if you're expecting an Unbreakable sequel, you'll probably leave disappointed;
- if you're expecting Split 2, you'll love McAvoy's take on almost 20 distinct personalities, and that alone is worth the price of admission;
- if you're expecting a formulaic superhero epic finale, filled with massive CGI fights and tremendous visual effects, all wrapped around colossal set pieces, then you are not worthy of even watching Glass, because this means you don't have a clue what this trilogy is about.

This is NOT a conventional comic-book trilogy. If you don't know this by now and you're still waiting for that last climax, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment, when no one asked you to anticipate such unrealistic stuff. Never criticize a film for not selling you something it was never even marketed to do (it's like expecting a horror movie to have a romantic happy ending). That said, I left disappointed with its conclusion, but there's still so much to love and praise. Seeing how David accepted who he was and the life journey he took, experiencing Kevin's pain and how each personality was born, understanding what Elijah's purpose is and being blown away by his mastermind plans ... These are characters so well-developed and so well-established that I can forgive some missteps here and there.

Before diving into the technical aspects, Anya Taylor-Joy, Spencer Treat Clark (Joseph Dunn) and Charlayne Woodard (Elijah's mother) deserve appreciation for their performances, even if they don't have that much impact in the overall story. Anya has more to do as Casey since her character's bond with Kevin is an explored subplot. Regarding the last two, they only serve as exposition devices which connects to one of my problems with the second act, by not helping the plot move forward in the smoothest way possible.

Concerning M. Night Shyamalan filmmaking skills, I barely have anything negative to say. The only minor issue I have is the excessive use of POV in the action scenes (a camera attached to the actor's body which provides a close-up of his face while fighting). Nevertheless, this film is yet another proof of how skillful this guy is behind the camera. There are so many memorable moments where the technique at display is worthy of awards. We will have to wait a few months to find such marvelous cinematography as in this film. Shyamalan and Mike Gioulakis (DP, director of photography) use our characters' respective colors (yellow for Kevin, green for David and purple for Mr. Glass) as the background palette of each scene in glorious fashion. The gradual change in color tells the audience so much about what our characters are going through, elevating one of the best dialogue sequences in the entire movie (the pink room).

The editing is sublime, and I love how Shyamalan uses close-ups to show how remarkable his cast is. McAvoy's performance is one of the best this year is going to give us, but part of it is even better due to the camera work. The unfocused background stunt work in a character's close-up is the art of filmmaking at his very best, and Shyamalan knows how to film it beautifully. The score is not as memorable as Unbreakable's, but the sound design is on point. Even with a low budget (compared to the other superhero movies), Shyamalan is able to produce a technical showdown of all his attributes as a sensational filmmaker. And this, my fellow readers, I will defend until the end of his career.

All in all, Glass doesn't live up to my extremely high expectations, but it does more than enough for me to enjoy it. I can't help but feel disappointed with the way everything ends and the path that Shyamalan chose, but there's still so much to love. James McAvoy offers you a performance worthy of any price of admission. Watching him portray over 15 characters is something you won't experience maybe ever again. Going through the layers of suspense, disbelief and mystery that the screenplay is structured by is itself an adventure filled with twists and turns which grabbed my attention until the very end.

An almost flawless first act delves into an overextended second act where the story lacks consistency and even logic, at times. However, the performances and the main thread of the film keeps everyone enthralled until the polarizing third and final act, where the significant plot twists occur. How can a movie be so fascinating and frustrating at the same time? Shyamalan, ladies and gentlemen. This masterful filmmaker lends all his skills to the film, and technically it’s close to perfection. Disappointing? Yes. Frustrating? Yes. Does it ruin the franchise? No, not even close. This isn’t The Matrix Revolutions, but it’s not Return of the King, as well. It’s a good ending to a superhero trilogy that might not be the best of all-time, but it’s up there, and it’s definitely unique, imaginative and the closest to what our real world would be like if superheroes were a real thing. 

If you’re a comic-book fan, this trilogy is mandatory. If you love Marvel or DC, don’t you dare use the word “grounded” without watching this saga first. Shyamalan, see you around!

450465,RalphRahal,"Glass (2019) is an interesting conclusion to M. Night Shyamalan’s unconventional superhero trilogy, but I’ll admit, it didn’t quite hit the same sweet spot as Unbreakable or Split. While it ties the threads of these worlds together, the magic felt a little dimmer this time around. That said, there are some genuinely impressive moments that make it worth the watch.

James McAvoy is the real MVP here. Once again, his performance as Kevin Wendell Crumb (and his many personalities) is mind-blowing. You can tell he’s putting his all into each character shift, especially when The Beast takes over. And Anya Taylor-Joy? She brought a depth and warmth to Casey Cooke that made her scenes stand out. Honestly, I was always drawn in when she was on screen. She gave the movie a kind of emotional grounding that it really needed.

The story tries to pull off something bold by questioning the idea of superheroes altogether, with Sarah Paulson’s Dr. Ellie Staple pushing the idea of whether their abilities are real or not. It’s a neat concept, but the execution felt a little clunky. The pacing dragged in parts, and some of the twists didn’t pack the punch I hoped for. After Split, where Shyamalan kept me on the edge of my seat, I expected a bit more intensity and polish.

Cinematically, though, it’s still solid. Shyamalan has an eye for atmosphere, and the way he uses confined spaces to create tension is clever. The score worked well too, understated but effective.

Glass might not be a masterpiece, but it still delivers enough to be part of the conversation. Plus, seeing these characters together is reason enough to give it a shot.",2024-12-28T00:01:47.950Z,5.0,Glass,2019

“Drag Me to Hell” (2009) marked Raimi’s return to the overdone comic book horror of his “Evil Dead” flicks after achieving blockbuster success with the “Spider-Man” trilogy. While unpleasant in ways since it deals with the assault of an evil spirit, the lamia, it’s all-around superior to the first two “Evil Dead” movies (I’ve never seen “Army of Darkness”).  

A critic who hated it claimed that it had no message. Whether people appreciate what the flick has to offer or not, it does have a message amidst its exaggerated comic booky thrills. A pretty glaring one on the surface along with interesting details if you go a little deeper.

4513,Gimly,"**The following is a long form review that I originally wrote in 2010.**

A new-age, brilliant vampire movie that never got the acclaim it rightfully deserved.

_30 Days of Night_ is one of the few films I like that I can never understand why other people don’t. Though I do prefer other movies like _Revolver, Doomsday and Donnie Darko_ to it, with those I can always understand when people don’t see in them what I do. With _30 Days of Night_, if you don’t have a problem with gore, then you shouldn’t have a problem with the film. And yet I have personal friends as well as people I’ve heard from online who totally dig horror, gore, vampires etc. and yet don’t like _30 Days of Night_, which confuses me all to Hell, let me tell you.

Though I was mildly aggravated by the inconstancies in the number of vampires around, other than that I can find virtually nothing bad to say about _30 Days of Night_. Firstly you have Josh Hartnett (_The Faculty_) as Sheriff Eben, protagonist, secondly you have Danny Huston (_The Proposition_) as Marlow, leader of the vampires, who attack Alaska during the winter period of 30 days without sun (which in and of itself is an awesome concept, and thirdly there’s Ben Foster (_Pandorum_) as the vampire’s human lapdog, all of whom are personal favourites of mine. That’s not even mentioning the fact that Eben’s wife is played by Australian Melissa George (_Triangle_), who was born in my hometown, so even if she wasn’t a great actor, she’d get auto-points.

Basically every point in which _30 Days of Night_ differentiates from the comic it’s based on is an improvement to the story, which is (gasp, shock, horror) a mildly realistic Vampire film. God forbid. I love the vampires in this. Though they’re not quite as sexy and well-dressed as they are in _Underworld _or as demonic as they are in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, they bring a totally new brutality to the vampire class. They wear what you’d expect late 30-ish people living in 2007 to wear, they’re stronger than the average human, but not impossibly so, they hunt in packs and give off bloodcurdling, atavistic shrieks (of which I give quite a good impression; sidenote) they’re unrelenting an animalistic but just as intelligent as a regular person, they’re quick, dark and deadly.

There’s no camp to be found here, not always a good thing, but in _30 Days of Night_, it is. I honestly cannot recommend this one enough, despite its intense gore and general panning, I implore you to at the very least give it a go, and decide for yourself.

Both the human survivors and the vampire invaders are there simply trying to stay alive, the vamps through their sadistic, systematic hunting of the local populace for their food-source, blood, and the people by trying to both hide, and fight back, but mostly the former. Ironically, it’s the “humanity” of the humans that causes every one of their downfalls, while they’re leached from above by a far superior race, who goes so far as to call humans a “plague” and invent a new language all for themselves, just so as to not have to speak the same filthy way we lower-beings do (and I mean, if your choice was between that and having to put up with American-English, wouldn’t you?).

4513,David,"Barrow, Alaska. The most northern town in the United States, where for 30 days every year it is has no sunlight.

This is the perfect opportunity for a gang of merciless, & blood-thirsty vampires to feed on the remaining inhabitants of this small town, after most leave for the month of darkness.

As people are leaving, and others are making preparations for their time of hibernation, mysterious occurrences are uncovered; mobile phones stolen, and destroyed, an entire team of sled dogs butchered. The ground work for the impending doom of a malevolent force.

Once the killings and feedings begin there is no let up. I have watched my share of vampire films, and frankly this is definitely one of the best made, its stripped back, bare, and unromanticized. This group of vampires, led by the visceral Marlow (Houston) take no pity on the town of Barrow as they tear it apart looking for their prey, and using people as bait to lure hiding survivors out into the cold and snowed out streets of the isolated mining town.

The second half of the film becomes a tale of survival, as town Sheriff Eben Olemun (Hartnett) and his soon to be ex-wife Stella (George), lead a group of survivors who manage to hide themselves away by staying in an attic, scared and cold they realize that it is only a matter of time before they are discovered and killed.

Even though this is a film that does involve a fair amount of blood and gore, the film's real heart lies in the way it scares you with what it doesn't show in the lead up to the early killings, this for me is true horror, show me next to nothing, and build the most amount of tension, then deliver the shock, and you'll have me pissing my pants every time. There is also a fair amount of brutality shown, not only in how the vampires kill their prey, but also how they are dispensed by Eben and the others.

On an interesting note, this is a film based on a graphic novel written by Steve Niles, who co-wrote the screenplay to the film. Niles had actually pitched the original idea as a film some years before, but reworked it to graphic novel after being knocked back by several producers, it was then picked up afterwards by one of those producers to make this film we have now.",2020-02-09T10:01:15.838Z,8.0,30 Days of Night,2007

Claire and Norman Spencer's marriage starts to fall apart when she believes there is a ghost in the house. Things gather apace when Claire is convinced that the spirit is trying to tell her something. Something that could be too close to home for comfort.

Robert Zemeckis does Hitchcock? Well yes, the influence is obvious, unashamedly so. But the trouble with that, is having the maestro as a benchmark renders all other modern day attempts as folly. However, casting aside that gargantuan issue, What Lies Beneath is an effective creeper come thriller that boasts star credentials.

Directed by Zemeckis, formed from an idea by Steven Spielberg (from the story by Sarah Kernochan) and starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as the fragmenting Spencer's. That's a pretty tidy bunch from which to launch your movie. What follows is a mixture of genuine unease and mystery, red herrings and standard boo jump moments, all of which almost gets lost on a saggy middle section as Zemeckis plays Hitchcock one too many times and loses sight of the supernatural heart of the piece, not helped by Clark Gregg's meandering script I might add. None the less, the picture gets pulled around for the finale as the spooky combines with thriller to produce some quality edge of the seat stuff. But it's only then that you totally realise that the makers here have tried to cram too much in to one film. In eagerness to manipulate the audience for the fine ending (though you probably will have it worked out at the half way point) the film just ends up as being confused as to what it mostly wanted to be.

Pfeiffer is excellent and looks stunning and Ford gives it gusto when the script allows. Support comes from Diana Scarwid, Joe Morton, Miranda Otto and James Remar. The house is suitably eerie with its waterside setting and Alan Silvestri's score is perfectly in tune with the creepy elements of the piece. It's a fine enough film in its own right, regardless of the Hitchcockian homages. It's just that it should have been a far better horror picture than it turned out to be. 7/10",2015-07-10T23:42:27.317Z,7.0,What Lies Beneath,2000
2655,Wuchak,"***Ghostly happenings in northern Vermont with Ford & Pfeiffer***

A couple living on Lake Champlain (Harrison Ford & Michelle Pfeiffer) face the empty nest syndrome as the wife experiences increasingly spectral happenings. Diana Scarwid, James Remar and Miranda Otto have peripheral roles. 

""What Lies Beneath"" (2000) is a Hitchcockian drama/mystery with a bit o’ horror. It starts by borrowing from ""Rear Window"" (1954), but thankfully veers from there. At a little past the hour mark I was starting to get restless. The story was progressing too slowly with too many doors inexplicably opening. I suppose it didn’t help that Pfeiffer doesn’t trip my trigger, although she’s serviceable (I wouldn’t say I DON’T like her); and Harrison’s character seems unjustifiably gruff and impatient. 

However, the Upstate Vermont/ New York locations are fabulous and a mysterious mood is effectively established. The way things pan out is unexpected, unless you saw the trailer first, which outrageously spoils it. The concluding F/X sequence is beautiful in a ghostly way and satisfyingly brings closure. What didn’t make sense earlier is elucidated. At the end of the day, the movie’s underwhelming, but not altogether unworthy if you’re in the mode for a flick of this sort.    
  
The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot in the Lake Champlain region of Vermont/New York (Burlington, D.A.R. State Park, Waterbury & Westport) with other stuff done in Southern Cal (Los Angeles, Playa Vista & Culver City).

Who is the paranormal woman she hears and sees, and what has is to do with her and her family? Robert Zemekis starts this off quite tensely, the imagery is scary and effective. The lack of gory or silly special effects gives it a chill that for the first hour, or so, works fairly well. Sadly, though, it runs out of steam and the storyline just loses it's way. The last half hour has more endings than you can shake a stick at, and when it does finally conclude I felt the whole thing was pretty far-fetched and unsatisfactory. Ford just isn't really at the races here - he was/is much better with roles that allow him to demonstrate his considerable charisma and personality. With no such opportunity here, his character is just flat - at times too earnest, at others just implausible.

Eventually twice the size and evicted from her apartment with her hands still glued to the ice cream pot, she is sent to a mental institution were she finally concocts a plan for revenge. Meantime, the marriage has rather gone to seed. ""Madeline"" seeks comfort in the arms of younger men, but when her latest beau rejects her, she finds herself - via the kindly intervention of an almost unrecognisable Ian Ogilvy (""Chagall"") - in the lair of the seductive ""Lisle von Rhuman"" (Isabella Rossellini) who offers her eternal youth. Of course there is a price - but will she pay it? What ensues for the last forty five minutes is really quite entertaining. Streep and Hawn look like they are enjoying themselves as their antics become comically macabre. Willis, the now bottle-hitting doctor - who has been largely reduced to manicuring corpses - is also clearly having some fun and Rossellini hams up wonderfully. The ending isn't my favourite, but I suppose it was ""fair"" and desserts were just.

10585,Gimly,"I'm a big fan of the _Chucky_ franchise. Throughout all of its ups and downs, Don Mancini and the gang have never failed to bring forward a watchable movie. Even the most recent entry, _Cult of Chucky_ (which was kind of a fuck-up) provided me great enjoyment as a series-long fan. But no subsequent movie has ever matched the original for me. That first _Child's Play_ didn't just birth a classic character, it is, in and of itself, a classic. The first time you see Chucky open his mouth and hear the words of the real Brad Douriff... I've seen it twenty times over, and I'm still floored every single one of them. Absolutely floored, and floored with a massive grin on my face to boot.

Of course there is loads of accompanying merchandise, but his widowed mother ""Karen"" (Catherine Hicks) has to make ends meet so the newly released doll is just too expensive for the young lad's birthday. Luckily for her, her pal ""Maggie"" (Dinah Manoff) finds a street pedlar who has one for a mere $30 and so she takes it home to the delight of the youngster. Unbeknown to everyone though, this rather ugly looking lump of plastic has been possessed by the demonic soul of ""Charles Lee Ray"" - a pretty brutal strangler who ended up being blown to bits in an explosion at a toy shop whilst being pursued by detective ""Norris"" (Chris Sarandon). When an unfortunate accident befalls poor old ""Maggie"", the boy discovers the truth and tries to explain the malevolence of his new toy to the grown ups, but they are sceptical. Until, that is, the mum discovers that ""Chucky"" manages to function remarkably well - without his Duracells - and soon she and the police officer are on their own toy- hunt! Despite only being about a foot tall, this doll is remarkably effective with a knife as he seeks vengeance on all who have betrayed him, and to involve ""Andy"" in his plan to stop himself becoming mortal and vulnerable. It's quite entertaining this, but not in the least scary. I found the young Vincent really got on my nerves after a few scenes and the story really doesn't have much substance to it. The camerawork tries hard to introduce a sense of menace, but the late 1980s synthesised soundtrack put me constantly on the lookout for ""Crockett"" or ""Tubbs"". It is short and the action, once we get going, comes thick and fast - but I found this all rather comedic and the ending, frankly, rather daft. Still, I can't say I hated it.

My first impression was, not another 'The Perfect Host'. And it is not, but the same category. This is a comeback film for the director after the average 'Jennifer's Body' that released half a decade ago. Some people liked it, but for me it was an average film, because I've seen the better one. Still, I appreciate the effort, like handling the narration. You know these days viewers are bit clever, they begin to predict from the early stage, so this story quite interestingly upheld the suspense.

Till the final act it keeps developing, not the story or the characters wisely, but the event where the plot evolves. A at a same time it leaves behind some clues about what might come later. That part is very confusing, I did not know what to believe and what not. Because I don't want to be a fool when twist happens. This was a lot dramatised and when the crucial event comes into play, the pace increased. The first 80 per cent of the film was what I enjoyed, but the twist ruined my party and then the final scene was so smart. The best way to conclude for such a thriller.

There are none tense moments, except in the final segment, but the curiosity of the event's states gets higher like particularly everybody is waiting for the twist to come. That's where some people would be disappointed. If you are not expecting too much, you would enjoy the remaining part as well. There's nothing to praise about the actors, all were just good. The script should have been a bit smarter in some parts. For one time watch it will do fine, that's what I favour.

306947,The Movie Diorama,"The Invitation incites audiences to attend the most anxiety-inducing dinner party ever. Grief. The melancholic turmoil of loss. A catalyst for unwanted prominent personality alterations that change the very fabric of who we are. Each individual experiences sorrow and subsists through a variety of different methods. Some forgive and forget. Others harness the inability to progress, experiencing a stumbling block of anguish as they continually inflict psychological suffering upon themselves. It is irrefutably the most difficult emotion to overcome, and can overwhelm the strongest of personalities. Kusama’s thrilling episode of ‘Come Dine With Me’ gradually explores the weight of life itself, simply by allowing a group of long-time friends the chance to discuss such a topic. Yet, what enables Kusama’s slow-burn thriller to elevate itself into the top echelon of effective profoundness, is its simplicity.

There are no extravagant plot devices. No sublimely utilised twists. And certainly no misplaced character conveniences. By equipping grief and depression as a manifestation of the narrative, Kusama was able to demonstrate her incredibly astute direction through natural plausibilities. Will, portrayed accurately and captivatingly by Marshall-Green, exhumed indications of paranoia. A heightened consequence of his raging anguish. Constantly questioning the actions of other characters, such as locked doors, barred windows and unknown guests, he assumes the role of the audience’s perception. We, as the viewer, examine and query each character reveal and emotional complexity simultaneously to Will’s interrogative persona. He, essentially, is us. Instantly allowing viewers to relate to him in this unusual circumstance.

Something is not right with this dinner party. He feels it. We feel it. But his instincts are muted by the other guests, naturally due to his heightened state of sorrow, in order to maintain a civilised appearance. That, right there, is the representation of depression. Forced to hide what we really are enduring, with despondent thoughts circling our synapses. It’s abundantly intelligent on Kusama’s part, who elevated the screenplay to the stratosphere of uneasy, anxiety-inducing storytelling. With the assistance of Shore’s cinematography, constantly blurring the outskirts and backgrounds of frames to enhance personable abandonment and solitude, Kusama hosted one of the most engaging dinner parties I’ve ever attended. Inviting a naturally diverse cast of actors, ranging from different ethnicities to sexual orientation, who inhibit their own character qualities.

An array of components culminating in a third act that switches from first gear to a gear with incalculable speeds. The wine was served, my heart rate increased. I required a towel, I was sweating that much from anxiety. Ignoring the last minute of the feature, which was an eye-rolling moment to say the least, a slow-burn thriller such as this utilises a substantial amount of foreshadowing as its narrative device. Unfortunately, it is inescapable. However, Hay and Manfredi do their utmost best to keep the conversation flowing during times of prognostication. Shapiro’s score is also worth mentioning for its sharp string-based chords that increase the chance of sweaty palms.

The Invitation, from the offset, is an incredibly simple thriller. Games are played, wine is served and a few arguments are bound to occur. However, if you cut through Kusama’s simplistic exterior, you’ll find an extraordinarily intelligent dinner party that evokes a powerful emotional connection.

It’s a bold choice to decide to set a movie exclusively during a dinner party.

_Happy Death Day_ works because Rothe is a charismatic lead, invoking the scream queen performances of yesteryear. Most of the other characters are far more secondary, so the burden falls on Rothe to bring life to a grounding role. As the lead, Tree needs to be intriguing enough for the audience to put up with the repetitive nature of the genre, but also pliable enough to allow her character to grow. Her relationship with Carter is particularly interesting because it has to both progress over the course of one day for Carter (who forgets everything as the day resets) and vary for Tree over the many different versions of the one day she lives through. Their relationship must be both a blank slate and feel as though the needle has moved forward at the end of each repeated day. Broussard and Rothe are able to sell it completely from the first time Tree wakes up confused in Carter’s bed.",2022-06-20T19:14:16.661Z,7.0,Happy Death Day,2017

440021,RalphRahal,"Happy Death Day takes the classic slasher formula and flips it into a fun, self-aware time-loop mystery. The plot isn't overly deep, but it works because of its energy and pacing. The directing keeps things engaging, balancing horror, comedy, and lighthearted moments without feeling forced. While the cinematography isn't groundbreaking, it effectively builds tension when needed and plays well with the repeating-day concept. The script leans into humor and character-driven moments more than hardcore horror, which might not work for everyone but gives the movie its own identity.

Jessica Rothe is the heart of the film, bringing charisma, comedic timing, and emotional range to her role, making it far more enjoyable than it would have been otherwise. The supporting cast does their job, but it's really her show. The score is serviceable, nothing too memorable, but it complements the film’s shifting tones well. Overall, it's a fun, easy-to-watch horror-comedy that doesn’t take itself too seriously.

A limited cast film. One night event. The whole film was shot within the three weeks. Minimised dialogues, maximised actions. This film has such a good record those. But apart from the performances and settings, there's nothing special. The same old home-invasion concept with so many flaws. If you are looking for nothing but an entertainment, then this will provide you that. But you should not expect more than that, it will foil you from having a nice time with the film. I enjoyed it too, though when it comes to the rating, I should be honest.

Maddie, an authoress who lost hearing and voice in her childhood is now living in a remote place, somewhat isolated from the people. On an ordinary day, unexpectedly, a masked man who killed her neighbour, is now after Maddie too. When she comes to realise that, the cat and mouse game begins. She locked herself inside. On the other hand the stranger trying to get in. As it goes like that for hours, so many twists and turns take place. How the remaining tale would turn out is should be watched.

Simpleness was the highlight. They did not try too much. Particularly, for a thriller like this, they usually scare the viewers with sudden and loud sounds. This film had those, but minimised. You can't blame for isolated settings too, because such crimes can be easily committed on those backdrops. It's all about Kate Siegel. Her best film, according to me. Nice direction, from one of the latest horror flick maker. But this is not a horror film. It is a terror, a thriller. Short running time and it is worth a try.

Something of the forgotten John Carpenter movie, Prince of Darkness shows both the good and bad side of the supremely talented director.

The story is a beaut, a bit skew-whiff, but unmistakably Carpenter territory as Satan exists in some sort of parallel universe. How he manifests himself is narratively a bit tricky, but still it makes for good horror, especially as the old religious angle finds Carpenter - in the guise of Donald Pleasence - chortling away to himself in a way that Old Nick has been prone to do.

Cue bugs, green goo, zombies and a centuries old sect determined to keep Satan out of our world. The scares are many, atmosphere bubbling away (in time with another of Carpenter's pulse beat synth musical scores), while the finale has a genuine surprise up its sleeve.

Unfortunately the cast are playing second fiddle to the supernatural strengths, working from a script that doesn't sit at one with the screenplay, rendering the characters as uninvolving fodder.

Frankly, I was not thinking of writing a review for this. You know, some animated movies come and go unnoticed, so I believed it would be one of those. In fact, I did not like the first film much, that is the reason to watch it so delayedly and with a minimum expectation. Better late than never, well, I regret for viewing it so late. One of the best animation of 2015, maybe in the top 10 or 15.

Well, it was a one liner, like, the daughter wants to move to the human social world thinking that might do good for her son's future. But her father plan to stop her getting away from him and the hotel. So those attempts are the rest of the movie. I liked the movie very much because it was very funny, especially the lines were and its accent, Adam Sandler nailed it.

I have said millions of times that I don't know why Americans and critics hate Adam Sandler that much, I don't know about the rest of the world but I kind of like his films. The last few films like 'The Cobbler', 'Pixel', 'Men, Women & Children' and this one were so much better. It did not bring the old Sandler, but brought us a different and new Sandler on screen. He was definitely the main reason for this film's success.

Don't just a book by its cover, well, here the cover is the previous installment. The first part was not a must see IMPO, but this is especially for the animated movie fans. PG rated movie, but still it might scare mildly for below 8 kids, only because of the theme. I had a great time with it and expecting it to do the same impact on you as well. And I can't predict the third will be as lucky as this one, lets wait and see.

This story of a shapeless, featureless space alien, instead of the usual ""little green men"", opens the door for a decidedly different kind of invasion movie. This version stays pretty true to the original and the advancement of special effects over 30 years allows for some really great and gory kills. The best being a victim being pulled into a sink drain and a wicked attack of a main character in a doctor's office.

There are some effects that aren't so good though, you'll scoff when you see them. The acting is really very good, and it's got its share of moments that are actually scary. The characters, even the primaries, could get swallowed up at any time. I'd say this is a must watch for any fan of the original.",2024-01-30T19:52:02.377Z,8.0,The Blob,1988

22 years after the murderous and maniacal events at Bates Motel, Norman Bates, freshly released from a mental institution, is back home; and the spectre of ”Mother” is waiting to greet him.

We could say it was a cynical attempt at latching onto the coat tails of the 1980s slasher boom, but in spite of having the unenviable task of being a sequel to a masterpiece, Psycho II is a rather nifty sequel.

Director Richard Franklin is helped by having Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles heading up the cast list, this gives the film instant credibility, and while the mighty spectre of Hitchcock looms large, Franklin doesn’t copy the maestro and brings his own visual smarts to the piece.

Tom Holland’s screenplay doesn’t mimic either, expanding the Bates story with a series of quality twists whilst keeping the mystery element strong and the gripping factor on the high heat. Dean Cundey (cinematography) and Jerry Goldsmith (music) round out the strong points of the film’s tech credits.

After 22 years at an asylum, Norman Bates (Anthony Hopkins) is declared sane and released, which is radically opposed by Lila Loomis, AKA Lila Crane from the original movie (Vera Miles). Norman goes back to his deceased mother’s house & motel where he befriends a compassionate local waitress (Meg Tilly). Unfortunately, some unforgiving locals won’t let him live in peace.

The first half of “Psycho II” (1983) is a compelling continuation of the classic 1960 film whereupon there’s an unexpected plot development around the mid-point (which is great, by the way).

From there, the events tend to bog down inside the creepy house with somewhat contrived twists & turns as the creators try to keep you confused as to who’s killing who. Thankfully, everything is sort of explained at the end with another revelation and what happened makes sense if you think about it. I say “sort of” because the truth isn’t fully spelled out. I appreciate that the film respects the intelligence of the viewer, but they should’ve made it a little clearer IMHO.

In any case, “Psycho II” includes several elements of the original while expanding on the story.

What’s great about the Psycho franchise is that it has its own story and Norman is a sympathetic character. It’s really a tragedy and not like the typical slasher where the antagonist is a zombie-like killing machine and its victims are mostly partying teenagers.

The film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and, like the first film, was shot at the backlot of Universal Studios, Universal City, California.

9638,Cat Ellington,"There are tall men, and then there's the ""Tall Man"". I actually saw the trailer, or preview, if you like, for Phantasm while awaiting the start of Invasion of the Body Snatchers in December of 1978. And I remember the trailer quite well, considering that the upcoming film looked scary as the word itself. The part in the trailer that really got to me was the scene in which the main antagonist, the Tall Man, played by Angus Scrimm, is standing outside of some kid's bedroom window (at night) looking in over the kid's head. It freaked me out ... Completely out. And being a horror film buff - even then at such a young age - I'd immediately said to my mother who had been sitting next to me: 'Ooh, ma, I wanna see that movie!' Phantasm looked horrifying ... And I loved horrifying movies. My mother said 'Yes'.

It would be the next year, in April of 1979, that we (only my mother and me that time) would finally see Phantasm. And it's scary as hell, I tell ya. Scary as hell. Oh, and as I'd also learned, the kid, whose window it was that the Tall Man stood outside of in the trailer, is named Mike. Scary as hell, I tell ya.

Be prepared, if you'll be a first time watcher of this cult horror, to scream and jump and feel chills as you're absorbing it. It is just that creepy. And I do believe that Clive Barker (God love him) would later borrow more than a few of the elements from Phantasm for his own cult masterpiece, ""Hellraiser"". I reckon that I'll always believe that to be the truth. Phantasm is sheer and ultimate terror. They just don't make 'em like this anymore.

9638,simest,"PHANTASM is an uneven work, too fantastic to be genuinely scary but ferociously unique and fascinating on numerous levels.

I think at the forefront there was a desire here to create a warped and entirely original Universe where nothing is as it seems and anything can - and probably will - happen. Logic is quickly cast aside and indeed has no place in the crooked landscape that PHANTASM paints. Into this bizarre, surreal.......even Dali-like twisted cosmos, are thrust a group of characters who - perhaps even by virtue of their acting inadequacies - seem somehow as much a part of the fabric of that Universe, even in their struggles to survive and make sense of it.

For me, PHANTASM has a hypnotic effect for all those reasons. Flying sphere drills, a gender bending alien cemetery keeper, hooded shrunken corpses refined for slave labour in some parallel Universe, a severed finger that morphs into a grotesque (if admittedly comical) fly and countless other wild fantasies are all episodic nightmares that work their way into my head and stay there - however well or not they may be executed. They are indeed, the essence of all the darkest, unfathomable episodes that invade our deepest sleep.

Also, the film's tendency to bounce us in and out of reality - if indeed there is a reality present at all - without warning, keeps us permanently on unstable ground. Dreams are very prominent and indeed prevalent in PHANTASM. So much so, that by the end there seems no dividing line between that which was real and which was not. In this sense, the film explored the territory that NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET would later make it's own but somehow achieves a dream-like quality that even Craven's classic would not surpass. Only Dario Argento's similarly bizarre INFERNO comes to mind as a rival to PHANTASM for the closest we might get to a dream realised on film.

PHANTASM is a unique, mind bending vision of quaint, small town America, infused with hellish fantasies of death, loss and isolation, unleashed from the subconscious mind - perhaps even in the end, from that of it's young, insecure and lonely adolescent protagonist.

Poe said ""Is all that we see or seem, but a dream within a dream?""

A dystopian British film. Zombie theme based on the book of the same name. The story of a few survivours, but all the focus was on the little girl. Thematically a very familiar film, but the storyline from the characters' perspective makes it unique. Nice cast, but it was not about Gemma Arterton. Her part was small, despite she can be seen in the film's entire stretch.

At the beginning, I did not know what's happening. Only after the second stage of the story commence, most of the doubts were cleared. But again, till the final scene, the film holds us with the strong progression. In some parts, it looks silly, but makes sense on the basis of its all the developments.

After their enclosure was broke, a group of survivours roams around the London looking for the food and the safe place. They manage to get away in some of the close encounters with the running deads. But how long it goes like that becomes the question. Besides, they divide when the girl comes into their topic. How the story ends was with a small twist.

There were some good zombie films in the last two years. This is one of those. If you like zombie theme, you might find it a refreshing. Not the storywise, but the characters. The little kid was so good. They have picked the right one for that role. Looks like it could be a cult film. Ends high, but I don't think there will be any sequel or prequel in the future. Definitely worth a try.

Demons (Demoni) is directed by Lamberto Bava and Bava co-writes the screenplay with Dario Argento, Dardano Sacchetti and Franco Ferrini. It stars Urbano Barberini, Natasha Hovey, Karl Zinny, Paola Cozzo, Fiore Argento and Geretta Giancarlo. Music is by Claudio Simonetti and cinematography by Gianlorenzo Battaglia.

A wonderfully nutty spiced Spaghetti Horror, plot has a group of people trapped in a Berlin movie theatre that suddenly comes under attack by ravenous demons.

It could reasonably be argued that Bava's movie has some cheeky narrative depth underneath the gloop and schlock, this is after all purposely set in a movie theatre and features a film that basically becomes real, sort of. But really it's a pic that's set up for like minded horror buffs to feast upon, to jump head first into its feverish horror comic book glee. 

The script is as poor as the dubbing is, with a roll call of cardboard cut out characters and loose end scenarios jettisoned in readiness for the next plasmatic explosive sequence. Yet the care free abandon of the gruesome killings on show, and the rapid pace of it all, ensures it's a fun packed ride.

109428,LastCaress1972,"David and Mia are brother and sister. As children, they vacationed in the family cabin, far out in the woods. As they got older, David took off, leaving Mia caring for their sick and ultimately dying mother. When mum threw a seven, Mia went downhill, and hit the class ""A""'s. She hit the drugs so hard in fact that she even technically died at one point, only to be brought back from the brink in a quite portentous bit of backstory. Well, enough's enough. David's back, and he, his girlfriend Natalie, and a couple more close mates of theirs, Eric and Olivia, intend to take her up to the old family cabin in the woods and force her to go cold turkey for a weekend. That'll learn her.

What's the deal with these cabins in American films and shows and whatnot? They always seem to be miles away from any recognisable civilisation. Do the owners own the land, and just decide to build a log cabin? How does one just take ownership of a patch of forest out in the middle of nowhere? I mean, they're never in a larger holiday park environment that's regularly patrolled and maintained. They're never one of a dozen by a beautiful lake, with neighbours here and there. No, they're always out in the deep wild nothing. It's like holidaying in a shed. Who'd do that? Also, the property is ripe for other people to just break in and use the place for their own nefarious ends: Free holiday? Crystal meth flop-house? Sex dungeon? A serial murderer's kill-room?

Kandarian demon incantations, resurrections and exorcisms?

Unluckily for our merry bunch of interventionists, that's exactly what's been going on down in the cellar of their cabin. Mia - hypersensitive as a result of her withdrawal - and the dog they've brought along can smell... well, a bad smell in the house. Upon investigation they find the cellar door, and through the cellar into another door they find a room full of skinned dead cats and similar small animals, all hanging off the ceiling by meat hooks. There's something else: A package wrapped in black bags, further enclosed in barbed wire. Someone obviously didn't want this package opened. Well, curiosity seems to have killed a bunch of cats already, and now it's going to have a crack at these guys. They open the package and, of course, it's The Book of The Dead. The tape player from the 1981 original is gone but in this version, fragments of the Kandarian script have been translated and written in English. And when they're read out, all hell breaks loose in soul-swallowingly familiar fashion. One by one, we will take you.

I liked this film, but it's a frustrating beast, for sure. On the one hand, it's as gory as f*ck, the sound design is superb, the movie is strewn with nods to both The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn (1987) without those nods seeming too hokey and the actors, whilst not especially outstanding, are at least as effective as the original cast (Bruce Campbell excepted, of course. There is no adequate substitution for him here and, in fairness to the new film, how could there be?). On the other hand... look: The ""intervention"" plotline was a great reason for the group going up into an isolated place, and it continued as a great device for when Mia started seeing and experiencing crazy Evil Deaddery (the woods-raping-the-girl scene from the Raimi original? It's back, baby! Sort-of); they put it down to her withdrawal. At best, she's lying so's they can all go home and she can get munted. At worst, she's bugging out. Except that, very early on in the proceedings, following Mia's insistence that there was a smell in the house, the boys, David and Eric (David, Eric, Mia, Olivia, Natalie. Cool, no? No.) discover the cat-swinging signs of foul witchcraft in the cellar (which we the viewers are privy to in the very first scene btw, before we even meet our protagonists), meaning they no longer have to put the weirdness down to Mia having a cold turkey episode. Just leave the premises, call it in at the nearest cop-shop, job done. So why don't they do this?

Because the characters in Evil Dead are prone to making some of the most pinheaded decisions I've seen in a horror film in maybe twenty years. And horror as you all know is a genre beset with characters who make pinheaded decisions, right? Well, the Evil Dead quintet make the average bunch of Camp Crystal Lake dirty-weekenders look like astro-physicists. I don't want to give away specific set-pieces but these characters seemed to have opportunity after opportunity to get away from what was happening to them. Their dunderheaded refusal to do anything but stumble towards their own demise caused me to lose any and all sympathy for them, and when you stop caring, the tension disappears down the plughole. While we were watching the movie, my missus said at one point: ""Yeah, but if they did that (ie the right thing), there wouldn't be a film, would there?"" But, in this day and age (and with the superior budget and skills availed to these remakes), I'm not prepared to buy that. There needs to be more. And in this case, the ""intervention"" plotline at the very beginning of the movie seemed to kick things off on the right note. It was the last decision by the characters that made any logical sense. The end fell apart too, but don't virtually all horrors unravel in the final fifteen? It certainly seems that way.

Still, I liked it, as I said. Didn't love it as I really hoped that I would, but I liked it. I suppose. In a way. Anyone not into horror will not come anywhere near anyway, but lovers of all things gruesome will find Evil Dead an entertaining waste of a nice and crisp ninety minutes.

In truth this was always going to struggle to appease many of the horror hordes, Sam Raimi's original film held up as some sort of religious artifact that should never be tempered with - this even though it was considerably trumped by the sequel (erm: remake). Is it fair to say that even before it was released there were those hating it? It certainly seemed that way. 

Can you judge this piece of horror film making on its own terms? Are there a new breed of horror film fans out there whom haven't seen Raimi's trilogy and therefore can go into it and get the tar shocked out of them? I hope so because this is a rip-snorter of a remake. Full of jumps, guts, gore, and genuine moments of terror, with Fede Alvarez and his team adding some fresh touches to Raimi's original nightmare.

Just having a dramatic reason for these characters to gather at this cabin immediately makes the story a bit more palatable than the original.  There are also several sequences towards the end of the movie that diverge from the original that makes this version vastly superior.

The other big difference is that the special effects has come a long way in the 30 years between the two movies.  The do an excellent job of keeping the pacing of the first movie and matching the effects to the original, but just better.

I applaud the unique direction to take the franchise, which has previously embraced camp, into a super realistic and vicious horror film. The effects and gore are the best of the franchise, having a nearly 20-year gap between the previous entry. Some of the scenes go down as all-time greats in horror that have been cemented in my mind ever since. The bread cutter scene is just disgusting and done so well, I absolutely loved all of the blood that was used in these scenes. The story is not as fleshed out as the first or second film, but it does take unique directions that I can appreciate it. The use of a recovering drug addict was done really well and was an interesting motive to keep the cast at the cabin. The weakened state she was in made her the perfect victim to be the first possessed, which worked really well. The dialogue and acting were quite atrocious. Other than Jane Levy, everyone else was quite bad. The lines were corny and delivered in a somewhat awkward fashion. This made the twenty-minute rising action of the film to be quite lackluster, but luckily once the action gets going, there is plenty of things to distract you from it. Overall, this movie's visuals and horror carry the film to its rating. It unfortunately does not live up to the hype I once had for it as a 15-year-old boy, but it is still one of the better remakes in cinema history.

109428,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A decent enough, but forgettable remake.**

Directed by Fede Alvarez, an illustrious stranger to me, the film is a remake of the original, from the 80s, directed by Sam Raimi. I didn't like the original film, I found it excessively dated, even in the effects used (which are, without exaggeration, the strong point of the film itself), but I recognize that Raimi is a creative and skillful director who knew how to explore the material well , do a lot with very little, and give us a decent film. This film, in turn, does not bring anything new or original, but manages to improve the original film's major flaw: the virtual absence of a script.

In fact, in this film, there is at least an attempt to create a story around what is happening and to make the whole story more than an excuse for the scenes where the living dead try to eat people. On the other hand, the simple fact that this film serves us with a slightly different story from the original film means we don't feel comfortable guessing what we're going to see next. There is a certain unpredictability that sounds good and feels good. On the other hand, the film cannot match its predecessor in terms of the impact of its effects and its importance to popular culture. It's a remake that has its merits, but will quickly be forgotten.

As for the cast, there is little to say. I don't know them, but I can say that I feel satisfied with their efforts. It's what you'd expect in a film of this type. A negative note about the film: if veterans considered the original film violent and full of gore, this film blows up every scale.

It’s epic, ambitious, crazy, witty and unafraid to go for the heart as well as the throat. As a whole, this adaptation of maybe Stephen King’s greatest work feels singular in the landscape of modern horror cinema: two films built on strong interconnected relationships spread over decades, as sentimental as they are vicious, and executed on the scale of a fantasy epic. They also may be amongst the best adaptations of King’s work, understanding what makes his writing (and this novel in particular) so horrifying and so arresting, the human horror amongst the fantastical. Andy Muschietti aimed big with ‘It’, and even in the moments its reach exceeds its grasp, you’re still so glad it reached so high in the first place.

So, Chapter Two is a sequel to It (2017), and my expectations were a bit high. I really enjoyed the latter to the point of considering it one of the year’s best, as well as one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations. Andy Muschietti returning to the director’s chair and having such a fantastic cast portraying the adult versions of the Losers (not only in terms of quality acting but also regarding how well the adults look like the older versions of the young actors) are two of the main reasons why I was genuinely excited. Also, the runtime (longest horror movie ever?!) definitely left me wondering how a horror flick could have the same duration of some of the most epic films in cinema…

Well, I got to be honest: I’m disappointed. It’s not a bad movie, at all, but it doesn’t even come close to its predecessor’s heels. I disagree with some headlines I’ve read though. Some say the comedy was misplaced, taking away impact from emotional or dark moments. There’s barely a moment where it was expected seriousness and laughter kicked in instead, but when it does occur, it actually works. I just think it wasn’t as funny as the previous film, overall. Granted, Bill Hader as Richie Tozier is hilarious, and a perfect cast as an adult Finn Wolfhard. His chemistry with James Ransone (Eddie Kaspbrak) resembles the one Wolfhard, and Jack Dylan Grazer had, therefore this/these duo(s) being the comedy highlight.

Some say the movie is too long. Now, this is a tricky one. Usually, when people feel bored or not as entertained as they wanted to be, they tend to blame it on the film’s runtime, especially if it’s over 100 minutes. I agree that the movie FEELS long, but I disagree that the runtime is too long. There’s more than enough story to explore, and literally, every single character from the Losers Club has an interesting arc. The problem here is that not all of them are explored in a way that’s funny, scary, or just captivating enough. The fact that Jessica Chastain’s (Beverly Marsh) sequence with the old lady is entirely displayed in one of the trailers (and consequently shown at every single screening) doesn’t help the pacing.

The first act is pretty decent. As expected, it shows us where everyone is, what they’re doing for a living, and how they get back together. During this act, it’s pretty clear that Muschietti is going to give time to develop each character and follow their respective arcs to the end, hence the lengthy runtime. However, the second act falls flat. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy / Jaeden Martell) has the most emotionally impactful storyline, one that affects the main plot, making the time that is spent with him worth it. Same goes for Richie’s subplot. On the opposite side, the rest of the group doesn’t have entertaining sequences or new developments whatsoever.

Beverly continues to be affected by her childhood of abuse from her father. Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan / Jeremy Ray Taylor) keeps being in love with Bev. Eddie is still a whiny little “kid” who’s scared of everything that might make him ill. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean / Wyatt Oleff) doesn’t do anything, and Mike Hanlon is surprisingly the engine that moves the plot forward, which is a problem of its own since I never really cared for that character (he was definitely the one put aside in the 2017’s movie). Honestly, he just serves as an exposition device considering he spends the whole time just explaining everything the audience needs to know to understand where the film is going.

Finally, the third act is a mixed bag. While it does provide a climactic ending with a sweet message, it feels very much like its predecessor. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it’s incredibly repetitive comparing to the first movie. Considering all things together, it’s a big letdown since it feels like the exact same film, but with older versions of the characters. Obviously, each of them has a different arc in this one, something the first didn’t have the time to explore, but looking at the main story, it’s pretty much the exact same thing, including how it ends (just with a minor twitch). Nevertheless, the performances are all great… 

James McAvoy continues his streak of amazing displays, and Bill Hader has to be the MVP for the range he demonstrates. I wish Skarsgård had more time to shine as Pennywise, though. In 2017, I thought he really nailed the character and made it his own. Unfortunately, this time around, Pennywise doesn’t have that much screentime (such a disappointment), and when it appears, it often looks too CGI-ish, taking away from the gripping performance of its actor. The finale has almost no Bill Skarsgård since there’s so much CGI. Despite that, I congratulate the team(s) behind the makeup, hairstyling, costume, and production design. Derry looks terrific, and the time jumps between the young and the old gang worked seamlessly partially due to these visual achievements.

Andy Muschietti knows how to work a camera, and the movie is very well-shot. However, he should have been able to come up with creative sequences to deliver a different level of entertainment, especially during the tiresome second act. Gary Dauberman’s screenplay is clever, and it brings this enormous story to a fitting conclusion, but he also could have imagined some new ideas for some of the characters. There are a couple of great sequences though, especially one with Bill going through a theme park tent with illusions. 

In the end, It Chapter Two fails to deliver a conclusion worthy of its epic runtime. Even with a phenomenal cast, it isn’t as funny, as scary or even as captivating as its predecessor. Its runtime is appropriated having in mind that each character has a personal arc, but only a couple of them are genuinely compelling and entertaining. Therefore, the film feels too long, uneven, and it could have used a bit more creativity when it comes to its climactic finale. Its central story feels very similar to the last movie, its scary sequences are nowhere near the quality seen before, and even though the costume and production design are top-notch, there’s excessive use of CGI on Pennywise. It still carries some emotionally convincing moments, as well as a couple of cool sequences. Overall, it’s … okay.

Making us proud Georgie.

I re-watched the 1990 mini-series and 2017 remake last month in preparation for this movie in terms of judging in quality. The 90's version had it moments, but I find some scenes unintentionally funny where it reeked of early Stephen King adaptations. 2017 was surprisingly good and a massive improvement, but laid back on cheap thrills.

‘IT: Chapter Two’ was a tough act to follow up on after the monster success of the first and with the second chapter being the hardest to adapt. I thought the movie both succeeds and stumbles in parts. Although reflecting back makes it feel more like a parody than a serious horror movie. An epic finale that ended in a over the top fashion - with themes of childhood trauma and the idea of holding on to the past despite growing up with age are sprinkled through out. The loser club are all grown up now and returning home to kill IT.

Whoever cast the grow up version of the loser club deserves massive praise here, because it’s pitch perfect casting and I could definitely see the child stars growing up to be the adult stars. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, and Isaiah Mustafa were all great in bringing the more dramatic aspects to the film. While Bill Hader and James Ranson bring the comedic aspects, but not to say they weren't dramatic as well, even making me tear up at one point.

Bill Skarsgard was truly amazing as Pennywise. The physicality in his movement has a certain silliness that you would expect to see from a clown, yet predatory with his animal-like attacks with drool running down his mouth and eyes staring in opposite directions despite looking straight at you. I find the dancing clown incredibly terrifying whenever he becomes playful and kind to deceive children.

Andy Muschietti truly shines as a director when it comes to bizarre imagery and unsettling camera angles, while also capturing some real emotions through the lens. The opening scene at the bridge where a homophobic attack takes place was really brutal and starts the movie off strong - on par with the Georgie meets Pennywise scene in the first movie.

Despite the run time being nearly three hours long, but I can’t recall ever being bored. It moved at a even pace in my opinion. I guess a few scenes could’ve been cut as most of it is unused footage from the first movie. Although it would be difficult to cut scenes as everything follows up to the next scene and that emotional punch towards the end wouldn’t be earned.

Now for the issues:

Henry Bowers was completely pointless in this movie and was only used for jump scars. Same thing with Mike, who through out these movies has nothing to do and the important things he did in the book was given to different characters.

I didn’t like how Stan’s suicide was handle, because you find out he actually “sacrificed” himself to save the others.

Some of the humor didn’t always land, especially if it’s right after a tense scene where it kinda deflates the horror. At times I struggled to gasp what the film marker was going for in certain scenes. Is this scene suppose to be scary or funny? Both maybe?

I wish there was more practical work for the monster scenes instead of CGI, because at times it looked really terrible. The finale battle at the end could’ve been in a video game boss fight.

18405,John Chard,"Lake Ends In The Road.

 

The Last House on the Left is directed by Dennis Iliadis and adapted to screenplay by Adam Alleca and Carl Ellsworth from the story by Wes Craven (co-producer here). A remake of Craven’s 1972 film of the same name (itself influenced by Ingmar Bergman’s The Virgin Spring), it stars Tony Goldwyn, Monica Potter, Garret Dillahunt, Sara Paxton, Spencer Treat Clark and Martha MacIsaac. Music is by John Murphy and cinematography by Sharone Meir.

 

During a family vacation, teenagers Mari (Paxton) and Paige (MacIsaac) are viciously set about by a gang led by recent prison escapee Krug (Dillahunt). When bad weather forces Krug’s car to career off the road, the gang, unbeknownst to them, seek refuge in the vacation home of Mari’s parents. When the parents realise what their new lodgers have done, they begin to enact bloody retribution.

 

It’s pointless going on about remakes of old horror films, they are here to stay and we continue to watch them in the hope that they will strike a chord with us. With The Last House on the Left, remaking it, to me at least, is understandable given the 72 film is not exactly a great classic itself. True enough to say it has that grainy grunginess that was so befitting the decade’s horror movies, marking it out as an unsettling experience without really living up to its “terrifying” reputation. In fact if you put both movies together they still wouldn’t have enough class in them to give Bergman’s movie a run for its money.

 

So the remake then, all glossy and big budgeted, with name actors in the principal roles, it is by definition routinely packaged for the modern day audience. However, that doesn’t take away from the fact that what unfolds on that screen is challenging us, it really does do its job. The pertinent question exists, are you capable of such violence having had violence inflicted on your loved ones previously? What would you do in the same situation that Mari’s parents find themselves in?

 

We have been privy to what was meted out to poor Mari and Paige, and the impact is most distressing. There is good cause to argue that Iliadis and his production team go too far in grabbing our attention in readiness for the “revenge” factor later on. Certainly I myself was uncomfortable watching it, as I was with the I Spit on Your Grave remake, but it’s about getting a prescribed response, however close to the knuckle it is.

 

It’s not a film anyone can feel comfortable about recommending, surely? But I know it put me through a gamut of emotions, even making me feel bad about myself the next day. That is quite often the power of cinema, and clearly the banner that Craven and Iliadis held aloft during the publicity tours for The Last House on the Left. Today I give the film an uneasy 7/10, it’s uncompromising and unapologetically violent, but also laced with flaws. On another day I may find myself rating it considerably lower…",2013-11-04T21:06:37.922Z,7.0,The Last House on the Left,2009

I admit I originally had no interest in seeing this '09 remake of 1972's ""Last House on the Left,"" which involved the rape/murder of two girls and the ensuing wrath the parents of one of the girls (loosely based on Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"" from 1960). Why not? Because the original movie was just so dumb. I know many hail it for being ""disturbing"" due to the vile, sadistic villains and the humiliation, rape and gory murders -- but I didn't find it disturbing at all. Why? Because the preposterous storyline accompanied by the goofy music and bumbling cops made it impossible to take serious. Consequently, just like I don't consider the violence in, say, a Road Runner cartoon disturbing -- because it's impossible to take seriously -- so I didn't find ""Last House"" disturbing. Dumb? Yes. An interesting early 70's curiosity? Yes. Disturbing? No.

Apparently director Dennis Iliadis and writers Adam Alleca & Carl Ellsworth understood the blatant flaws of the original because this remake overcomes them all and is a near masterpiece of filmmaking.

Without knowing what it was, I stumbled upon this remake last summer while channel-surfing in a motel in the heart of Nebraska; the opening caught my attention and I became engrossed. About 40 minutes into the story it dawned on me that this was the remake of ""Last House on the Left."" Although I couldn't finish the film, the first thing I did when I got home was secure a copy for viewing.

What makes this remake so good? For one thing, the filmmaking itself is top-of-the-line -- the cinematography, music, cast, acting, mood, suspense, etc. all work together to make a superior piece of cinematic art -- yes, even though it's ""just a horror flick."" I was particularly impressed with the way the film juxtaposes the beauty of nature & people or family with the hideousness of human evil. Take, for example, the opening scenes of the beautiful woods & music followed by the thug's murderous escape and the later sequence where a fleeing girl is shot while swimming through a lake. The film was incidentally shot in Helderberg Nature Preserve, Western Cape, South Africa, of all places. Gorgeous locations, to say the least, and a fine stand-in for somewhere-in-the-sticks, USA.

The character of Justin was another great element. Through no fault of his own he's the teenage son of the main scumbag. It's clear that Justin hates the perverseness and hypocrisy of his ""family life"" and craves normalcy and genuine love. He's in torment but is too afraid of his father to overtly act (and understandably so), but he does what he can, when he can. The message of Justin is that people are not cursed to follow the wicked/foolish ways of their bloodline. Simple wisdom and force of righteous will breaks the curse. Redemption is there, if you want it.

I also liked the way the film depicts the duplicity of the thug gang, particularly the leader Krug (Garret Dillahunt). He's the ultimate POS but watch him cover-up his intrinsic wickedness with his knack for social acclimation -- a fake smile, innocent smalltalk and a well-placed ""Amen."" The film successfully shows how some people aren't what they appear to be; they're the express opposite! Not to mention the flick is a good reminder to always be on your guard. Don't be naive; not everyone's like you or me. Some people will happily abuse, rape and kill without a second thought. They're scum, pure and simple (by their OWN foolish choices). If you have daughters make sure they view this, even though some parts are hard to watch.

Also, the numerous preposterous elements of the original story have been fixed. The family is vacationing in a wilderness area and there's only one town nearby. The daughter successfully steers the criminals close to her home, unbeknownst to them. The thugs aren't dressed-to-the-nines when they show up at the parent's doorstep, not to mention they have a legitimate reason (""There's been an accident"").

The goofy elements of the original -- the silly music and bumbling cops -- have been eliminated altogether. The film has a serious, realistic vibe and therefore the horrific events are taken seriously.

There are a couple of clichéd horror aspects I could do without, specifically the scenes involving a garbage disposal and a microwave. They're a bit silly and needlessly stretch the believability. But then it struck me that they're types of universal/divine judgment & justice, which works for me.

Another aspect that improved upon the original involves one of the victimized girls, but I don't want to give it away.

At the end of the day, this '09 remake is vastly superior in every conceivable way and proves that remakes can and should be made when/if appropriate. In ways it's even a masterpiece, a brilliant showcase of beauty and the beast. Don't miss out just because you thought the original was a dubious.

The theatrical version runs 110 minutes and the unrated version four minutes longer; both versions are featured on the DVD (I haven't seen the unrated version since the theatrical was more than enough for me, if you know what I mean).

A truly great Werewolf movie, one of the best in fact, The Howling - in some eyes - has lost some of its bite over the years due to countless sequels and imitators, but its importance never dims. It often gets forgotten that The Howling changed the werewolf DNA for the better, it invented its own hairy beast as it were, refusing to copy past treasures from the olde classic era. But director Joe Dante shows the utmost respect to those who had previously eaten at the Lycan table, naming many of the characters in his film after directors of Werewolf movies. Nice.

Another thing forgotten, due in no part to the release of An American Werewolf in London later in the year, is that Dante's movie often has tongue in bloody cheek. It is happy to be a parody of the sub-genre of horror it loves, while some of the comedy visuals are deliciously and knowingly dry. But this is a horror film after all, and it so delivers in spades the frights and nervous tremors, even sexing things up as well. These Werewolves are completely bestial, and in human form enjoy having their secret other halves. This is just a colony at the moment but domination of all humans is most definitely appealing and on the agenda.

Horror fans will sometimes stumble across a debate about effects wizards Rob Bottin and Rick Baker, who is best? It really doesn't matter, both are geniuses of their craft. Bottin is in the chair here, while Baker served as a consultant before doing his thing on An American Werewolf in London. The transformation sequences are superb and still hold up today as brilliant craft work, no CGI cheap tactics here. No sir.

The acting, though - well Wallace just isn't very good, nor is ""Avengers"" regular, and not terribly versatile, Patrick Macnee who comes across very much as a fish out of water as the supernatural elements take over and the quality of the film falls away. The use of dialogue in the latter part of the film is sparing, and that is more effective as the darkness, shadowing and Pino Donaggio score do engender some sense of peril but I just wanted a better, more engaged, cast.

The Howling is a definitive werewolf horror film that introduced new ideas to the genre and broke new ground for special effects. The hidden secret werewolf community with opposing ideologies and opinions on how to either hunt or hide from humanity brought more to werewolf lore than a simple crazed monster. The Howling was also the first English-speaking movie to showcase female werewolves. Joe Dante pushed the limits with this film and positioned himself to become the director of Gremlins because of its success, but The Howling is dated and not at all scary by today’s standards.

11298,Wuchak,"**_The first time cinema audiences saw werewolves like this!_**

After a news anchor in Los Angeles (Dee Wallace) has a traumatic experience on the sleazy side of town, her therapist (Patrick Macnee) sends her and her hubby (Christopher Stone) to his secluded resort near the coast for treatment. When frightening things happen at the sylvan colony, she contacts her friend to come out (Belinda Balaski), not to mention the husband (Dennis Dugan). 

“The Howling” (1981) was the first of three major werewolf-oriented films in 1981, debuting in April. ""Wolfen"" came out on in July and wasn't really a werewolf film, but rather a thinking person's nature-runs-amok flick. ""An American Werewolf"" came last, released in August, and was easily the most successful at the box office, making three times its cost in the USA alone and six times worldwide. Yet, ""The Howling"" was more successful if you go by profit in comparison to cost, as it was surprisingly low-budget for a major release. ""Wolfen"" was the most expensive by far, as well as the most serious and artsy, yet it flopped.

This is my favorite of the three and easily the best of The Howling franchise, which currently includes eight movies, even placing with the top werewolf films of all time. It starts dynamically, albeit somewhat confusingly, with the milieu of the network studio and the shady side of Hollywood Blvd. Yet the bulk of the movie thankfully takes place at the woodsy community by the northern coast. When you think it’s over, there are a couple of surprises at the end, one that is now iconic.

Amazingly, it cost ten times less than “An American Werewolf in London.” Rick Baker was originally doing the special effects, but bailed in favor of that other film, which left the effects job to assistant Rob Bottin. I think the F/X are better here, although they’re both top-rate for the time period.

Blonde Dee Wallace and brunette Belinda Balaski were starting to show signs of aging but were still very attractive. Raven-haired Elisabeth Brooks plays the sultry woman at the camp and has a full-nude scene, which she only did because she was told that the smoke from the campfire would cover her up, yet that’s hardly the case. She refused to do nude work previously because, as she put it, she believed in the Bible and had morals. Needless to say, she was upset and this ended up being her only cinematic nude scene in her career.

This film and “Howling IV: The Original Nightmare” (1988) were both based on the same novel by Gary Brandner. While not in the same league as this, the latter is actually a more faithful adaptation of the book. Like this one, it’s a slow-build mystery with full moon ambiance, yet it switches the location to the remote desert (shot in South Africa); unfortunately, the ending is rushed and awkward.

The immediate sequel, “Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf,” came out four years later and is a dubious horror flick, but at least it included the input of Brandner (unlike the other sequels) and it's so over-the-top it's sometimes amusing. Christopher Lee tried to keep a straight face while Sybil Danning hams it up as an alluring werewolf queen in various eccentric outfits. It has a memorable theme song; and the Czech Republic cinematography features some nice Gothic props.   

The best sequels IMHO are parts VI (“The Freaks”) and V (“The Rebirth”), with a nod to VIII (“The Howling: Reborn”).

It runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles and Mendocino in Northern California, which is a 3 hour, 15 minutes, drive north of San Francisco.

396422,John Chard,"Conduit Demon: Take 27!

OK! It may not be 27 films in the latest conduit demon phase of horror film making, but it sure as hell feels like it! Annabelle: Creation would have been a very good horror film if it had come out 10 years ago, as it is we find ourselves treading familiar ground and relying on the usual horror film making playbook for our thrills.

Anyone such as myself who is bothered by pediophobia, automatonphobia and pupaphobia will surely be chilled to the bone here, for the makers push it to the max, with fine results. However, once that aspect is stripped away and the sound and visual horror staples grow tired, we are left hankering for a glorious final quarter of film to terrify us - which sadly doesn't materialise as we then get conduit demon 101.

In the pluses column there's a superb tie-in to the real Annabelle doll, an adherence to story as fact shrewdly inserted, and the acting (with young Lulu Wilson bright again as she wanders in from Ouija: Origin of Evil) is more than adequate. Sound mix rocks, as does the photographic shadows and shimmers, rendering the production technically good. If only the writers had been a bit more bolder and imaginative...

Much better than Annabelle (2014) (which isn't hard really), ""Creation"" is above average fare for casual horror fans with the fears previously stated. Hard core horror nuts, however, are likely to be very jaded come the end credits rolling. 6.5/10",2017-12-10T09:40:32.502Z,6.0,Annabelle: Creation,2017

The second spin-off from 'The Conjuring' franchise and overall a fourth film to set in the same universe. The first film, which was 'Annabelle', I thought it was an okayish. Now with this, there's a potential sub franchise. Probably it could head back to back-wards as prequels, while 'The Conjuring is heading forward.

There's nothing new from this, but still not a bad film. I liked the location. A single house in the mountain and revolved around a bunch of orphans. It is where it all begins. The creation of the most haunted doll that you saw in 'The Conjuring'. Focused on a doll making family, following an accident, how the family lived their rest of the life was told.

A nun with a few orphan girls joins the family to live-in. When one of the kids discovers the locked away doll with secrets, the evil force unleashed. In the latter parts, the film reveals what happen to them and to the doll. Also hinting out at a possible prequel, going to be in Europe. I felt it was decent, so okay for watching once, especially if you had liked the previous one.

396422,r96sk,"<em>'Annabelle: Creation'</em> isn't all bad, though did underwhelm me if I'm to be truthful. The mix of stories of Samuel/Esther and the orphans isn't majorly watchable, while the repeated use of young girls as the basis of these plots in this universe is getting a bit repetitive.

With that noted, like in <em>'The Conjuring 2'</em>, the best performance does come from one of the kids. Talitha Bateman gives a good showing, her character sure is repeatedly flung here, there and everywhere! Stephanie Sigman is solid, while I wish we got more of Miranda Otto as Esther.

There are more teases of <em>'The Nun'</em>, which I am actually looking forward to seeing in the standalone films - definitely the most creepy and interesting character in this series thus far, hopefully those doen't fall flat like these follow-ups to <em>'The Conjuring'</em> have. Comparatively, this is the best of 'em and I like it more than <em>'Annabelle'</em>.

""Possessor"" is an exception where critics (72 Metacritic Score) and users (7.6 Metacritic Score) agree that it's a pretty damn good flick. 

The acting is excellent. Andrea Riseborough from ""Mandy"" is creepy odd (again) as a mind-possessing assassin, and Christopher Abbott from ""It Comes at Night"" is a depressed AND possessed soul for the next assassination. 

There are too many adjectives to list to give the film justice, so here's just a few: disturbing, violent, bloody, mind-bending, visual, provocative,

In a year where the horror genre didn't have that many great representatives, Brandon Cronenberg's remarkably captivating concept is an instant attention-grabber. Boasting two phenomenal performances from Andrea Riseborough and Christopher Abbott (Colin Tate), Possessor is one of the most visually shocking films of 2020.

From the extreme gore to the unrestrained depiction of insanely violent murders, Cronenberg fills his movie with creepy imagery that will definitely trigger many viewers to simply give up. Its slow pace helps establish the never-ending suspenseful atmosphere, which ultimately delivers some of the most intense sequences I've seen in a long time.

Despite the interesting narrative and its eye-opening developments, Possessor fails to keep the momentum going throughout the entire runtime. The weird imagery helps with visual storytelling, but it reaches a point where it becomes too distracting and unnecessary. The third act is also quite predictable, contrasting with the somewhat surprising first half.

In the end, it's still one of my favorite horror films of the year.

201085,Frank Ochieng,"The feasting of the eyes comes to mind when realizing the polished opulence of writer-director Guillermo del Toro’s Gothic supernatural production Crimson Peak. Undeniably luscious and wonderfully bizarre, Crimson Peak is a psycho-sexual thriller that resonates with the enticing visual senses and registers with the proper amount of off-kilter seduction and twisted charm. For filmmaker del Toro his unconventional narratives have always been peppered in exquisite bounciness regardless of their hit-or-miss effectiveness. In joining past del Toro genre-ridden offerings that range from the revered cult-like stimulation of Pan’s Labyrinth to the misplaced but eye-popping stiffs such as Blade II and Pacific Rim it is safe to declare Crimson Peak as another elegant and gaudy candy-coated canvas of del Toro’s imaginative cinematic vision.

Aesthetically stunning and armed with a sophisticated lining of suspense, Crimson Peak does not necessarily exude any real momentum of toxic scares or memorable chills. Still, it manages to rely on its Gothic-induced romanticism that is enough to accept this splashy and offbeat vehicle on the merits of its unique brand of animated style. Sure, there are displayed predictable paths to tap into Crimson Peak’s erratic pulse and maybe del Toro and fellow co-screenwriter Matthew Robbins could have injected some more convincing bits of subversive edginess to spice up its modest creepiness. Nevertheless, one can appreciate the borrowed Hitchcockian overtones combined with the arresting set designs and peculiar ensemble. This alone invites Crimson Peak as a colorful costume drama layered in concentrated showiness.

Thankfully, the October release of Crimson Peak should echo the spooky spirit of Halloween appropriately and offer some seasonal sizzle for the macabre-embracing moviegoers. The story may not be startling to the point of an innovative revelation but the winning element–at least one of them anyway–is the exceptional art direction and production design that suitably defines del Toro’s mystifying universe of nostalgic ghostly aberrations. Crimson Peak will not be confused with high-minded horror anytime soon but it does effectively promote its lush, Gothic-induced romantic vibes.

Budding American novelist Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska, “Alice in Wonderland”) has one specific belief system to hang her literary hat on and the sentiment is self-explanatory: “Ghosts are real!”. This haunting message has plagued Edith since she was a young girl growing up in Buffalo, New York in the early 1900’s. Edith was an only child of privilege and an apple in the eye of her widowed wealthy father in businessman Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver). Naturally the protective parental instincts kick in as Cushing is weary of an opportunist that might wanting to court his eligible daughter Edith.

Enter the seemingly shifty and broke British aristocrat Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). Sharpe has an agenda and it is quite clear. Apparently Sharpe wants to shop around a potential profit-making mining device and needs financial support and promotion from an influential American contact. Coincidentally, Sharpe starts a relationship with promising writer Edith whose Daddy Dearest happens to be a prominent industrialist. How convenient, huh? The skepticism about Sir Thomas Sharpe starts to mount for the concerned Carter Cushing as he stands by and regrettably witnesses his precious offspring Edith’s affection for the cunning character.

Of course Sharpe is not the only target that moneybags Cushing needs to worry about as the loving companion to his treasured Edith. Sharpe’s older sister Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain, “The Martian”) accompanies her sibling on his mission to do whatever he has planned for his personal gain. So now Cushing has double trouble with the mysterious brother-sister Sharpe tandem as they are embedded in the indelible psyche of the artistic Edith. However, the Sharpes have spun their web as they now have turned Edith into a member of their family as both wife and sister-in-law. Thus, a fresh existence begins for Edith Cushing Sharpe on the other side of the pond in Northern England where the Sharpes’ Cumberland-based estate Allerdale Hall is located.

Realistically, the less-than-stellar Allerdale Hall is not exactly the ideal venue that caters to the so-called prominence of the aristocratic Sharpes. The vast Victorian house is relentlessly drab and does not reflect the impressive homestead that it should be in status and structure. In making matters worse at Allerdale Hall Edith is restricted from stepping into certain parts of the dilapidated dwelling. Plus, Edith is overwhelmed by the recurring appearances of pesky apparitions that roam in and out of the expansive hallways of the isolated, blood-colored domicile. Lastly, the creaky goings-on is not helped a bit by the drastic change in hubby Sir Thomas’s demeanor as Edith feels duped by his on-going indifference. Edith has to feel uneasy and uncertain about what she has gotten involved with concerning the grasp of the mischievous Sharpes and the life-long warnings of afterlife spirits in the decaying manse that she has been taught to take seriously since childhood.

The sinister symbolism is adequately atmospheric and the erratic pacing makes for some rather genuine, tense moments. However, Crimson Peak does show some flashes of being a slight boofest melodrama that undermines its titillating convictions. As an eerie romancer Crimson Peak feels a tad uneven. The three-way love triangle pitting Wasikowska’s Edith against both Hiddleston’s Sir Thomas Sharpe and Charlie Hunnan’s Alan McMichael (Edith’s first suitor before Sharpe’s arrival) could have been explored but felt rushed and pushed aside. The whispering presence of shadowy ghostly figures floating about within the decrepit walls of Allerdale Hall makes for some convincing hair-raising hedonism that is compatible with del Toro’s topsy-turvy color-toned exposition.

Overall, the real scene-stealers behind Crimson Peak’s brightly spry makeup belongs to the film’s handlers responsible for the glossy sheen of this eye-fetching film project. Credit the sumptuous contributions in the aforementioned art design and sets (not to mention the crisp cinematography and fashionable costumes) to propel Crimson Peak’s entertainment value beyond the tepid lapses in manufactured jitters.

Seen all the Del Toro films, but this one was not any good compared to his recent year's class. The film has his signature mark, the gothic style atmosphere, visually spectacular, but the story did not strike as expected. Definitely my blame is on the writing department. Though the actors were so much better in their character exhibition, especially the lead trio.

The opening convinced it will going to be a terrifying horror. Seriously? The writer brought ghosts for a concept, but ended penning a fantasy-thriller. In the middle of the narration there was too much drama that dragged the story. And in the third act it turned totally into a killer-thriller. It should have been more frightening, they wanted it to be a faulty human nature kind of twist than supernatural things. Well, they gave what they wanted, not what we the audience looking for.

I did not completely disliked the movie, I enjoyed it other than its plot. The costumes were very nice, the music well blended with the screenplay, but I was disappointed with the reason given as the motivation for all the trouble faced by character Edith. After all the hype, what it revealed was too little and too sudden with guessable stuffs. You can try it for the visuals alone than anticipating another Del Toro's masterpiece.

201085,Wuchak,"Jane Eyre meets House of Usher with ghosts of the past

RELEASED IN 2015 and written & directed by Guillermo del Toro, ""Crimson Peak” is a Gothic drama/mystery/horror about a young woman (Mia Wasikowska) in the opening years of the 1900s who falls in love with a mysterious English man (Tom Hiddleston) and moves from Buffalo, NY, to a creepy English manor, where his weird older sister also lives (Jessica Chastain). Ghosts of the past make themselves known, ultimately leading to the truth.

Aside from Jane Eyre and House of Usher, both of which have been filmed several times, “Crimson Peak” has similarities to haunting Gothic flicks like “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992), “The Others” (2001) and “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein” (1994), but it’s thankfully nowhere near as ridiculously melodramatic as the latter. The spectral horror is more low-key than “Dracula” and “Frankenstein,” which is why I cite “The Others.” Psychological Gothic horror like “Demons of the Mind” (1972) and “The Eternal” (1998) are other comparisons. If you’re in the mood for a movie like these, you’ll probably appreciate “Crimson Peak.”

Honestly, this is one of the most sumptuously LOOKING movies I’ve ever seen. Take, for instance, the numerous scenes of Edith (Mia) walking down the lavish halls in an alluring white nightgown and flowing blond hair. The Gothic lushness is to die for.

Some people think the story is meh, but it’s no better or worse than the plots of the seven movies listed above. Whilst the first act in Buffalo is somewhat tedious, the movie picks up interest once Edith (Mia) moves to the unsettling English chateau, which has seen better days. I read a critic’s list of a dozen questions in an attempt to tear the film to pieces, but I easily answered all of them, which showed that this critic was intentionally LOOKING FOR something to dislike. Every potential quibble is effortlessly explained by clues in the picture or simply reading in-between the lines.

The Stephen King novel from which the screenplay was adapted very nearly didn’t see the light of day. It was actually written by King based on a real place and instances during a stay at a rented house. He was never quite happy with the tone of the book and only submitted it as a contractual obligation. Glad he did because it provides a very solid grounding for horror and deals with the very real horrors of overwhelming grief.

The film gets the tonal flows right, the family dynamic is neatly pitched in readiness for what is to come later, the house and the titular Pet Sematary of the title are eerie personified, and Fred Gwynne is on hand for a sage old characterisation. The potential for shattering horror is not fully realised, yet the makers deliver a good quota of scares and unease to make this a better than average King adaptation to screen.

The troubles for the young doctor only get worse when a real human tragedy occurs and he is faced with the ultimate dilemma... It's more of a cumulative story this - like many of Stephen KIng's stories. The plot builds by degree and is told here in a way that almost asks us what we might do differently from ""Louis"" even though we see, and can readily anticipate, the consequences of his actions. The horror here is not so much garish and scary, but human and almost voluntary - and that makes it a little more effective. There's no getting away from it, though. The acting is mediocre and the visual effects at times reminded me of an old episode of ""Bagpuss"". I am not now, nor ever have been a pet lover - so the underlying premiss of hysteria when the cat gets splatted also never really resonated with me either.

It is no wonder the films based upon Stephen King's fiction don't fare particularly well. It isn't because they are bad - well, at least in some cases - it has more to do with the fact that for some bizarre reason they just don't transfer well onto film. However, one of the bonuses here is Mary Lambert. She is a splendid director and she is able to give the odd twinge on your emotions when Gage tragically dies in such horrific circumstances. She also makes the extended game of cat and mouse through Jud Crandall's home - first with Jud, then with Louis's wife Rachel, and finally with Louis himself - very compelling and this segment is also enlivened by some of Stephen King's macabre brand of humour. However, ""Pet Sematary"" amply illustrates why Stephen King remains head and shoulders above other horror writers. His situations - who wouldn't be tempted to bring a loved one back to life if the opportunity ever presented itself? - and his characters are always realistic and this makes all the difference.",2025-04-04T00:32:30.193Z,5.0,Pet Sematary,1989

This is a parody of 80’s slasher flicks, especially the Friday the 13th franchise. The story revolves around five teens somehow being translated into a fictitious 1986 slasher movie called “Camp Bloodbath.” The prematurely deceased mother (Malin Akerman) of the teen heroine (Taissa Farmiga) starred in the movie and she gets to meet her again, albeit as a young woman.

While this 2015 film is a throwaway flick it’s reasonably entertaining, especially if you’re familiar with slasher films. What I like best is that it has heart and you can feel the loving relationship of mother and daughter. It’s also nice to see Nina Dobrev again, who’s one of the most alluring females in the cast, although she’s outshined by curvy Angela Trimbur as airhead Tina.

Mixing ""B"" movie conventions with a modern day fun sensibility, Arachnophobia sees Frank Marshall direct and Jeff Daniels, Julian Sands, John Goodman and Harley Jane Kozak line up in the cast. Though horror and comedy on the surface doesn't seem to be a that hard to blend together, it's actually surprising over the years just how few horror comedy movies can claim to be successful, and crucially, have been able to to win over a like minded audience. In fact, if we move away from the likes of ""Sean Of The Dead"", the ""B"" movie creature feature, especially in modern times, has few offerings of worth. We can certainly mention the awesome (and best of the modern bunch) ""Tremors"", which turned a small Worldwide profit, and then we turn to ""Lake Placid"" and ""Arachnophobia"". Both of the latter made considerable amounts of cash (for the genre) and are propelled by a degree of star wattage. 

What was in Arachnophobia's favour was that spiders strike the fear of god into many people, thus, as director Marshall said himself on the publicity junket, ""People like to be scared but still laughing at the same time"".  Arachnophobia achieves this in spades, mixing real spiders (the Avondale breed) with model and magnet work, where the effect achieved is full on nervy giggles coupled with some creepy goose flesh also putting in an appearance.

The cast work hard to make it work. OK, Sands remains as wooden as he always is, but in this case his pompous bug professor actually calls for it. Daniels as the modern doctor hoping to start a new life in the country, is an excellent lead, a fine actor who's no show on the ""A"" list of Hollywood remains an utter mystery. However, it's with the big jolly blunderbuss that is John Goodman where the pic gets its frothy ""B"" movie fun. His inept, half witted but knowing pest controller, Delbert, engages in that small town Americana way. He is an innocent to the terrors of the world and that makes for a nice play off with the Arachnophobic Dr. Ross Jennings (Daniels).

29427,John Chard,"Boo-yah, indeed.

Directed by Breck Eisner and written by Scott Kosar & Ray Wright, The Crazies (2010) is a remake of the 1973 film directed by George A. Romero. It stars Timothy Olyphant, Rhada Mitchell and Joe Anderson. The plot sees a toxic spillage make its way into a small American town's water system and turns some of the locals into marauding maniacs.

Eisner's movie is that rare old thing these days, that of the horror remake that greatly improves upon the original. That might annoy some Romero purists, but the truth is, is that his original film really isn't that great to begin with. Thus it's ripe for a remake, whilst acknowledging that a certain weariness creeps into our thoughts at the seemingly never ending line of horror remakes getting churned out by a Hollywood running out of ideas. Hell I will even venture that we have seen all this before, nothing in this ""Crazies"" will have the horror faithful rushing out to tell their buddies about some overtly cranial splendour piece they have just watched, but this is a very effective horror piece, taut and tense at times, at others sick and splendidly disgusting. Eisner may not be a ""Craven"", or for sure no ""Romero"", but he executes the material with gusto and shows a knack for knowing how to make the material work.

The film is structured over three parts. Character formations in the little town of the delightfully small Americana sounding Ogden Marsh, which leads into the infected going doolally. Then it's the army attempting to get things under control. Lastly it's the the fall out as our brave survivors, erm, try to survive and make sense of what is happening. Eisner and his writers even get away with not fleshing out the principal characters. We know Olyphant's Sheriff is a toughie, and that his pregnant wife, Mitchell, is equally resourceful, while the deputy played by the film's standout performer, Joe Anderson, we know is loyal and sharp with a rifle. Who cares about flesh on these bones, let the crazies after them and see how they cope. Where the writers score plus points is with the portrait of a world losing its humanity.

29427,Kamurai,"Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.

I have no idea how I went 10 years without seeing this one.

It shows you my frame of mind when this was the most uplifting thing of my day.

This is a great survivalist movie: an unknown infection occurs in a small rural town, and the government is closing in to secure and ""decontaminate"" the area.  And get nothing wrong, ""our"" government will contain, secure, and then protect, in that order.

Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell kill in this, they're great start to finish.  Joe Anderson does steal the show a few times though, really embodying the spirit of a rage filled person.  Danielle Panabaker is the reason this got on my radar at all, but she is sort of ""emotional teen girl"", and I feel she's too big an actor for that, so it wasn't my favorite part.

The writing is well done, in a progressive manner that makes me think that we really missed out on a ""The Crazies"" videogame.  The thing that makes this the infection more interesting than the average rabid / zombie movie, is that these infected are still ""smart"".  Now they're uncontrollably driven to kill, but they can do it by car / rifle / coordinated attack, and even an overwhelming mob.  Hell they can even set traps.

So you're basically fighting insane people on PCP.  The infection effect seems to differ based on how inclined you are to kill people.  There were a couple that managed to hide until they came across someone they had motivation to kill before infection.  Some people are just confused, like they don't understand why they're doing what they're doing.  Others ""round up da' boys"" and go a hooting and hollering.  The range of behaviors keep you on your toes.

On top of the infected, you have the military cleansing the area who (in theory) are still in their right mind, and no idea what is the infection vector.

I really enjoyed this, it did remind me of ""Mom and Dad"" which has a similar infection, but the psychological motivations are much clearer and have a very nice built in complexity.",2020-07-30T02:44:16.915Z,8.0,The Crazies,2010

The Crazies isn’t a typical zombie film as the infected don’t become mindless shamblers. Instead, these kind farmers and mild-mannered townspeople become emotionless and murderous killers using whatever weapons they can find to expedite the slaughter. The suspense starts slow in the early minutes of the film but consistently builds to a fevered anxiety as the military attempts to quarantine the outbreak trapping the survivors inside with the crazed infected. Timothy Olyphant’s performance as the local sheriff trying to keep his family alive against a town of former friends and neighbors turned insane murderers is outstanding and genuine. The Crazies cast does an excellent job building buy-in and investment in their characters, making the audience actually care when one meets their brutal fate.

Helped by their case worker ""Mark"" (Matt Smith) they are given the basic essentials to get by, but as their stay becomes more extended they struggle to fit into a community that is at best disinterested, at worst a bit hostile - all whilst they start to believe that their new home is possessed! Things quite literally start going bump in the night and the couple begin to wonder if this has something to do with their ancestors, or perhaps the spirits of the folks they left behind to face the uncertainty. It's those last scenarios that we see expressed through dreams and flashbacks and that give us a clue as to just what horrors they escaped. Question is, though: are there now even greater horrors here for them now? At times this can be quite a compelling look at the psychology of people caught between two stools. Not fitting where they now are, not fitting where they once were. The cultural challenges they face now, though, aren't really developed and I found the characterisation of the ultra-tolerant ""Mark"" a little hard to believe, especially as the hunt for their ethereal nemesis starts to manifest itself in ways that become a little too surreal. Indeed, that's maybe the problem with this. It's trying to combine social and political points, but there's nowhere near enough punch from the dialogue and any message is bogged down in a confused hybrid of their supernatural experiences and the reality of their new British life. It can't have had much of a budget but that needn't have mattered had director Remi Weekes focussed more on keeping the story tight and on developing the characters a little more. It invites us to sympathise based on what he presumes are our own moral standards rather than present us with anything or anybody that's especially interesting. As ever, Smith completely underwhelms and though Mosaku offers us some emotional oomph, the rest of this is disappointingly unremarkable.",2024-10-25T08:42:45.879Z,6.0,His House,2020
9913,Wuchak,"_**The Louisiana bayou, an antebellum mansion, Hoodoo and Kate Hudson**_

A New Orleans hospice worker (Kate Hudson) takes a job at a dilapidated antebellum mansion in the bayou caring for a dying old man (John Hurt). His wife seems to be hiding something, however (Gena Rowlands). Peter Sarsgaard is on hand as the estate’s amiable lawyer.  

""The Skeleton Key"" (2005) is a Southern Gothic supernatural thriller set in the Louisiana bayou à la “Cat People” (1982) and “The Reaping” (2007). It’s not as good as the former, but arguably superior to the latter or at least on par. Most of the film is an eerie drama taking place in and around the old Southern mansion, but the pace picks up in the final act with a quality surprise climax. Neither my wife nor I were able to anticipate the revelation, but it makes sense and hails back to earlier obscure horror flicks which I can’t name because I don’t want to give it away.

Kate is a highlight with her cute face and the director doesn’t fail to capture her beauty in a tasteful way, but she needed to gain about 12 lbs as her thinness is un-alluring. Really, the only negatory is that the setting/cast is one-dimensional, which makes the movie tediously mundane, but this is offset by the creepy supernatural element.    

The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in Louisiana (Felicity Plantation, Vacherie; Bayou Gauche & New Orleans) with additional stage stuff done in Universal City, California.

11587,talisencrw,"Very good sequel retains the high standard Blatty's original screenplay set!

In going through the original 'Exorcist' trilogy (I have the DVD 6-pack, with the two versions of the remarkable original, as well as the two recent prequels, so far unwatched), I was intrigued of seeing Oscar-winning writer William Peter Blatty's second stint behind the camera (for the record, I adored his 'The Ninth Configuration', done a decade prior), especially for the franchise that became his bread-and-butter (though I loved two films he earlier had co-wrote: 'A Shot in the Dark' and 'The Omega Man').

He once again does quite a credible job--both with the writing and in helming the picture. To me, it didn't matter much that Linda Blair wasn't involved--I like how it became a search for an already-dead serial killer--and I have been a great fan of George C. Scott in genre films since the likes of 'Dr. Strangelove' and 'The Changeling'. The scares and shocks were genuine, and the suspense and interest were there. It made me wish that even more sequels had been made, it was THAT good.",2016-10-07T22:26:21.683Z,8.0,The Exorcist III,1990
11587,tmdb28039023,"What's good in this film we can attribute to William Peter Blatty's script and direction and to the casting, especially Brad Dourif and George C. Scott; what's bad, to Executive Meddling – in particular the last minute exorcism performed by a last minute priest; it says a lot that Burton's Father Lamont from Exorcist II: The Heretic is more memorable than Nicol Williamson's Father Morning.

Unlike The Heretic, III looks and feels – except for a bizarre dream sequence featuring cameos by Fabio and Patrick Ewing as angels – like it belongs in the same world as The Exorcist; that is to say, it knows the words and the music.

There are haunting visuals that stay with you long after the film is over (the crucifix opening its eyes, the old woman crawling on the ceiling, Scott's daughter's near decapitation). At the same time, the film has a sense of humor that I would call shakespearean; Father Joseph Dyer (Ed Flanders), whose dialogue includes a reference to Mel Brooks's Spaceballs, is akin to the gravedigger in Hamlet or the porter in Macbeth.

What bothers me about III is the same that troubles me about The Heretic – though to a much lesser degree –, and it's the 'how.' Specifically, how Patient X, alias Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller), ends up in a cell in a hospital's psychiatric ward for the past 15 years.

It's a good thing that Blatty decided to have X played by both Miller and Dourif – more so the latter than the former –, because Dourif, as James 'The Gemini Killer' Venamun, has a long, expository, loose-end-tying monologue which proves that sometimes you can indeed polish a turd; it doesn't, even after allowing for supernatural intervention, make a lick of sense (the corpse of a beloved local priest bursts out of his ""cheap little coffin"" and goes missing, and no one is the wiser? Yeah, right), but it's all in the delivery.

Dourif turns in a blood-curdling, bone-chilling campfire tale (at one point he even briefly reflects ""is this true?"", as if he finds it hard to swallow himself). Now, I'm not saying Miller couldn't have done this, but in retrospect I don't see how he or anyone else could have; I only know Dourif did it because I watched him do it in a movie-stealing performance that doubled the considerable respect I already had for him and his craft.",2022-08-25T16:53:50.751Z,6.0,The Exorcist III,1990

I don't like Halloween, and I've had time to say it before, but I recognize that it's the best time for good horror films to be broadcast on television. These days, I saw this film as a follow-up to “Halloween”. I have no doubt that it is a worthy sequel, perhaps one of the best I have seen, in that it is strictly faithful to the original and is made with quality.

It is directed by Rick Rosenthal, but the team and cast remained the same, with the addition of specific names, and John Carpenter's inspiration continues in the script he wrote and in the attention he undoubtedly gave to the entire project. Pleasance is the actor who looks in the best shape here. He finally had better material and more time to show some value on stage. Jamie Lee Curtis has essentially stayed the same and retains much of what he did. It doesn't disappoint, but it doesn't bring any surprises either. The soundtrack also doesn't bring anything new, maintaining the essence of the first film's score, which is positive.

After its initial success, it is no wonder that this film's budget was more substantial than that of the first, and that the number of corpses that fall throughout the plot also increases. A plot that is not particularly brilliant, well written and elegant, and that falls into the most basic clichés of slasher horror without any shame, but that manages, at least, to respect coherence with the original film and give the villain an almost iconic aura, an invulnerability that makes him unstoppable and impossible to kill, and that turned him into a cinema icon. In addition to these points of relative quality, we also have good lighting and cinematography, good use of sets and filming locations, better quality effects that are as well executed and practical as those previously used. Everything comes together, therefore, to form the image of a film that is not surprising, but manages to respect and stand alongside its predecessor.",2023-11-08T02:29:42.636Z,5.0,Halloween II,1981
11281,CinemaSerf,"If you recall the conclusion of the first part (1979) then you’ll know that “Michael Myers” is now the deadliest critter alive (that’s assuming that term actually applies!). He’s certainly not forgotten “Laurie” (Jamie Lee Curtis) who’s recovering in the local hospital and luckily for him, this is a dimly lit and largely empty facility that he can wander around with relative impunity slaughtering all who come onto his path. Perhaps the only hope for the bed-ridden gal is the determined doctor “Loomis” (Donald Pleasence) who has teamed up with the sheriff (Charles Cyphers) to try to thwart this latest attempt on her life. What’s pretty clear is that this new, improved, version of “Myers” isn’t going to give up easily and that bullets and knives aren’t going to work. How to stop him? It starts off quite strongly, this film, but once the scenario switches to the hospital it becomes all a bit too stage-managed for me. The place is conveniently dark and gloomy; there is but a skeleton staff and so his rampaging is left unfettered whilst the hitherto poorly patient appears to develop live-preserving ninja skills. Also, fortunately for her her nemesis never appears to want to run anywhere so she can always make it to the timely departing elevator or the conveniently positioned window whilst he flails around robotically trying to impale her on/with something. It relies too heavily on trying to build a gradually increasing sense of peril but with has such inevitability about it that I thought it became quite sterile after about half an hour. JLC doesn’t really feature so much and the only real screaming that goes on here is that which suggests sequel. It’s watchable enough, but hasn’t the creepiness of the first one and most of his victims probably deserved their fates!",2025-02-06T08:00:07.711Z,,Halloween II,1981

I remember coming out the theatre after having seen Flatliners in 1990 and being really annoyed. The premise of the story is so superb and was ripe for a terrifying horror film, but Flatliners then, and now, is not terrifying, but that actually doesn't matter.

In 1990 some of the more bright young acting prospects were off making Memphis Belle, the other half that was made up of potential Brat Packers like Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, William Baldwin, Oliver Platt and Kevin Bacon, were joining director Joel Schumacher for this delve into life after death experiments. 

The tyro medical students, led by a darkly egotistical Sutherland, begin inducing their own deaths to see what awaits once the flatline has been reached. Seems great at first, but as the students push the time limits of being dead still further, what comes into their real worlds is actually not welcome.

Pic is never close to being frightening, but the thematics involved are chilling and the big message at its heart is loud and clear. At times it's an uneasy blend of supernatural dalliances and medical science, but the breezy cast hold engagement, while cinematographer Jan de Bont's misty lenses are perfectly in the realm of the ethereal. 7/10",2014-11-23T13:51:16.422Z,7.0,Flatliners,1990

102780,Reno,"> The way I wanted like the old days, great!

An Irish vampire movie, thus back to where the vampires were originated. There are no good vampire movies these days, all those are teen target products which are simply a fantasy flick. In the old days, its horror and terrifying ugly giant beasts, the werewolves were, but in the todays movies they are adorable giant wolves. It's either vampire movie or werewolf, the result is same. 'Twilight' or 'Vampire Academy' and others, just not my type, though watch them for entertainment and to keep up-to-date.

The reason I watched it is for Saoirse Ronan, because I like her. But Gemma Arterton has been so good like always. To me this is what called a vampire movie. Of course, themes should vary from a movie to another, that does not mean one can completely abandon the basic theory. Neo-gothic is one of that, the present filmmakers forgets, because that kind of set-up gives Dracula effect. This film has been just like everything I wanted, so I enjoyed every bit.

It is always great to see a movie that portrays the world over the span of 100 or more years. As usual survival and hiding the identity is the main intention for the concept. But from who (other than humans) and why is the suspense that reveals formally at the right time. If you like 'We're the Nights', then this is the right one to pick. But not great as 'Interview with the Vampire' was, in fact, it was directed by the same director.

273271,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**For an unpretentious and understated film, it turned out to be very effective, intelligent and well-made.**

In this film, a group of three young people who live together (a couple and a single friend who lives in the house) discover that the old man who lives in the house in front of theirs, disappeared a few days ago and no one knows about him. When they investigated, they discovered a large camera in the middle of the room, and a collection of photos of their living room, taken by that mysterious machine that, to their surprise, takes pictures the day before they can happen. Reluctant to interfere in the future, they decided to imitate the photos, ensuring that nothing bad happened to them and fearing that the inventor had fallen, victim to any attempt to alter the future. But everything will get complicated when they start using the machine to earn extra money.

The movie is quite good, and the story works on top of an intelligent and well-written script, which guarantees us an hour and a half of good cinema, although it is not completely free from predictability or cliché situations (such as the situation of love betrayal among the friends). For a film with low budget and high creativity, the result is quite positive.

The reduced cast is expertly led by the trio Matt O'Leary, Danielle Panabaker and George Finn. The three actors seem to have a good rapport for the cameras, or that translates into a more harmonious and efficient work together. The film still has other actors, such as Amin Joseph or Jason Spisak, but only the three central actors that sustain the entire plot.

This film fell into oblivion a long time ago, and it's good to let it be where it is: it has no truly notable qualities and doesn't deserve a recap at a time when there are so many much better films to see. In fact, it's hard to think that the great director Peter Jackson, who is so widely respected today, started out with such bad work.

Apparently, Jackson was enchanted by the cheap horror of the 80s and the bad taste comedies that also populated this decade, where it seems that tastes were all changed. The film is completely amateurish and this can be seen in the terrible cinematography full of grain and the clumsy and disconnected editing. There are some effects, but almost everything is cheap and sounds plastic, fake and ugly. Still, considering the modest budget and lack of quality resources, I think Jackson did a decent job. Perhaps the director himself, however, would prefer not to be remembered for this film!

23963,Oldnewbie,"Upon watching this film for a second time I realized just how much it reminded me of the famous ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast Orson Welles aired in 1939. With just the medium of radio he successfully created an atmosphere of panic so real people listening (who had not caught the beginning where it stated that the following was a radio drama) fled their homes thinking aliens from Mars had invaded Grovers Mill, New Jersey!

""Pontypool"" takes place almost exclusively inside a small radio station in the town of Pontypool, Ontario Canada. What starts out as an ordinary day slowly morphs into an extraordinary situation told almost entirely through eye witness call ins, a weather reporters sky view, and eventually the towns doctor who has a preposterous yet undeniably believable theory as to what is going on.

Director Bruce McDonald and writer Tony Burgess expertly create an atmosphere of frustration, disbelief, and panic all within the confines of a single set. Never once did I feel limited by not seeing what was going on outside. Like the aforementioned ""War of the Worlds"" radio drama, the situation unfolds by audio reports coupled with the unexpected entrance of the doctor.

For blood and gore fans there is a scene that is both shocking and heartbreaking. But this film is generally not for that audience... unless they have good imaginations and can be taken in by ""eyewitness"" accounts of brutality.

The other part of the tale that is refreshing is that the antagonism that is affecting the outside world is not a virus nor is it the dead come back to life. No... it is something... as the doctor explains... preposterous yet undeniably believable.

The casting of Stephen McHattie as the past his prime but not ready to go quietly DJ was a masterstroke. He brings to life Grant Mazzy in a way I cannot imagine another doing as perfectly. He mixes a jaded world view with pathos, anger, humor, and a just the right touch of madness as all around him slides into madness.

I saw this on my own in a cinema last night which was a bid sad - it's not a great film, but it is still a mildly amusing mickey-take of this genre (and of what passes for film-noir nowadays) and though instantly forgettable, is still a well produced and enjoyable enough gore-fest.",2023-04-17T07:24:59.650Z,6.0,Renfield,2023
649609,Chris Sawin,"_Renfield_ is an okay horror comedy. It has a ton of potential with its excessive amount of blood and Nicolas Cage is worth the price of admission alone. The action sequences have all of their entertainment value sucked away by the end of the film; mostly because they all feel so similar. The humor and story reach a brick wall that the filmmakers refuse to stop pounding your face into.

_Renfield_ is like the junk food version of a horror comedy. It has all the right ingredients for something that should be fantastic, but its recipe for action, comedy, and satisfying storytelling is imbalanced to the point of near disgust.

""Renfield is yet another movie that provides precisely what it promises - with an unbelievably ridiculous, purposefully silly story about the toxic relationship between Dracula and Renfield, expectedly elevated by the ""OTT King"" Nicolas Cage and an up-to-the-challenge Nicholas Hoult. The light, humorous environment leaves space for action sequences that are also intentionally excessive in all technical elements, which makes the entertainment levels inconsistent due to the continuous blend of quick cuts and outrageous amounts of blood. The dedication of the stunt team deserved better and much more screen time. Still, if you're a Cage fan, you won't be disappointed.""

649609,garethmb,"Over the decades countless movies, plays, books, comics, video games, and

television shows have depicted Vampires in various mythos which often
include differences in behaviors, abilities, and, motivations. While there have been many Vampires, none have ever achieved the fabled
status of Dracula who has been the template ever since Stokers’s book and
the classic original film as well as subsequent appearances. In the new film “Renfield” audiences are introduced to Renfield (Nicholas Holt), who recounts his past as an ambitious lawyer who ended up serving
Dracula (Nicolas Cage) as a Familiar when his original intention was to
close a real estate deal. After his Master is injured after another attempt by Vampire Hunters,
Renfield relocates Dracula to New Orleans and looks to find suitable prey
to help his master return to full power.

 This in turn leads Renfield to a self-help group as he plans to help the
poor souls there by using their tormentors as prey for his boss which he
hopes will in some way eliminate the burden that has built over the
decades from his servitude. This plan goes horribly wrong when he attempts to subdue an abusive
individual and his group lands Renfield on the radar as not only an eager
a police officer named Rebecca ( Awkwafina), and a drug lord named Edward
(Ben Schwartz). Mixing humor, action, and gore aplenty, Renfield must also deal with his
rising self-help motivations as he looks to stand up to his boss once and
for all and have his needs heard and respected which naturally does not
sit Weill with Dracula.

What follows is an amusing, chaotic, and gory adventure that while at
times inconsistent and meandering with the story; still finds enough ways
to entertain.

Cage hams it up to new levels in his portrayal of Dracula and he is
literally chewing the scenery in every scene in which he is featured and
it is one of his most enjoyable performances in recent years.

Hoult, Awkfwafina, and the supporting cast work well, and while the film
does get more than a bit loose with the story and gaps in logic even for a
film of this type it still manages to work. Dracula talks of a big plan
for world domination but we get little more than lip service which would
have helped to make this version of Dracula a more defined character.

The focus is more on comedic action than horror and it is clear that the
the cast seemed to be having a great time with their roles so as long as you
are willing to overlook issues with the plot; you may find “Renfield” one
of the more enjoyable comedic outings of the year.

649609,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"If not for a trademark over-the-top Nicolas Cage performance and a truly inspired fight scene in an apartment complex, “Renfield” would be a total disaster of a movie. It’s certainly not any good and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone, and the real horror of it all is the way director Chris McKay blows what should have been a slam-dunk premise.

Set in present day, Renfield (Nicholas Hoult) is the tortured, loyal assistant to Dracula (Cage). He’s served his master for decades, taking care of everything from getting his cape dry cleaned to procuring fresh prey for dinner. After centuries of servitude, Renfield is finally ready to move on and create a life of his own.

Although it is mostly dead in the water, the film’s pacing never feels slow. There’s plenty of entertainment, it’s just not fun enough, outrageous enough, nor twisted enough. The tone is both tongue-in-cheek and sincere, which is not cohesive as a whole. There’s a lot of action that means nothing, and characters like Awkwafina‘s police officer that are bland and forgettable.

The side plots about a crime family with a ruthless boss (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and her son (Ben Schwartz) that wants Renfield dead is half-baked, and the funny group therapy bits where Dracula’s assistant seeks help for co-dependency and dealing with his raging narcissist of a boss falls flat. The ideas all sound so good on paper, but are poorly executed across the board. That’s why the movie feels so underwhelming.

Cage is by far the best part of this mess, and he is an actor who is born to play Dracula. He hams it up in every scene, and his unhinged take is genuinely scary but also goofy. His manic line delivery and unhinged inflection of such dialogue gems like “Hail Satan” is absolute bliss.

The blood and gore is over-the-top and mostly used in a humorous manner, but this isn’t for the squeamish. There is graphic throat ripping, spurting blood, and abdomens slit open with internal organs visibly spilling out. McKay doesn’t shy away from the violence (and the makeup and effects are really great), which should at least delight horror fans.

With such a great idea for story, it’s a bummer that “Renfield” is disappointing in nearly every way imaginable. You’ll find yourself mourning what it could have been.

649609,MovieGuys,"Its been a while since I've seen Nicolas Cage in a role, I feel, does him justice. Renfield gives Cage the opportunity to shine. 

His comedic take on Dracula combined with the ""very English"" performance, handed in by Nicholas Hoult, makes this film work, in spite of itself. 

The comedic premise behind Renfield is highly original, I'd even say, quite clever. Whats not so intelligent, however, is the handling. 

The potential for comedic flair and fun is drowned, in good measure, by the over the top, often rather grotesquely visceral, blood soaked, violence. Violence that's on the cusp, of the proverbial, splatter flick. 

In summary, a moderately watchable film that leaves the compelling feeling, it could have amounted to more, with subtler, less violent, treatment.",2023-05-05T05:05:27.354Z,6.0,Renfield,2023
649609,erosap,"Awkwafina should have been on the poster!
=========================================

Not knowing she was in this, is what probably made me resist watching Renfield right away. She is the most watchable part of the film.

Maybe because the rest is not a revelation; everything that happens in the movie with Cage and Hoult, is just predictable vampire tropes—the trailer was enough for that.

At any moment, it was neither horror, nor comedy. Although, at the very beginning, the recovering Dracula is convincingly threatening; but not once he 'gains full power'.
The excessive, exploding blood-works would have been funny, if they were selective with it's use. But they end up using it everywhere, even the kills that are meant to invoke fear and sadness. Perhaps it was an attempt at nonsense comedy. But, didn't come across very well.

649609,Nathan,"I was not expecting much from Renfield and it pretty much gave me exactly what I was expecting: a mediocre film that was nothing offensive but all too forgettable.

The screenplay is really all over the place. There are too many subplots and not enough time spent on the actual draw to the film, Dracula. Awkwafina's subplot was half baked and really did not go anywhere. I felt as though her character could have entirely been written out of the film to spend more time on Renfield and Dracula. The comedy is pretty bad. I do not remember laughing one time during the hour-thirty-minute runtime. There were clear jokes that they were trying to set up, but they just did not land for me.

Performances were fine. Nicholas Cage was great as Dracula, but unfortunately did not have enough screen time or material to really make a huge impact on the film. Nicholas Holt was good in his role, but again I do not think he had much to work with. Everyone else gave really average performances. Awkwafina plays literally the same style of character as she did in Shang Chi, and it was fine, but nothing that really blew me away.

The direction was pretty poor. So many action scenes had a tremendous amount of shaky cam and some weird motion blur type effect that made it really hard to see what was happening. It was brutal, don't get me wrong, and I loved what they attempted to go for, but it really just landed flat. Coming off from John Wick just a few weeks ago, the action direction was apparently bad. The gore was at an extreme, but for the love of God, why did they choose to use CGI blood? The graphics literally looked like something out of a PS2 Mortal Kombat; absolutely terrible. Which is a shame because that mixed with the poor action direction really took me out of every scene when I should have been locked in having a bloody good time.

Overall, this film is a misstep in what could have been a fun, campy, cult classic. The jumbled screenplay, poor stunt choreography, and terrible effects really hold this movie back from its true potential. There is nothing truly awful that make this a bad movie, just enough there to make it an extremely average experience.

Nicolas Cage is a nice piece of casting and delivers in the role of Dracula, as I'd expect to be honest... feels like a Cage sorta character! Nicholas Hoult and Awkwafina are decent, I've seen better from the latter elsewhere but her performance improves as this one progresses. Honestly, I would've reworked the film to revolve around Cage, rather than Hoult.

The story didn't really connect with me, as in I didn't get the required entertainment from it. It's alright, I just didn't really care for what I was watching - more like just acknowledging its existence, rather than actually sinking my teeth into what was happening onscreen.

536554,Nathan,"M3GAN achieved its goal perfectly by delivering a hilarious dark comedy that was incredibly aware at how ridiculous the premise is. It had me laughing my ass off and had some pretty decent kills for a PG-13 film, although I think it could have been even better with a hard R rating.

But this film is not just a dark horror comedy, it dives deeper than its surface appeal. Deep down there is intimate social commentary on parents using technology as a crutch. Whenever M3GAN is in the room, Gemma finds it easier to neglect her niece and let's M3GAN take control of the parenting. This makes it much harder for her to get a genuine connection with her to fulfill motherly needs. I found this surprisingly compelling and really does have a genuine impact in today's society, obviously not with life size android dolls but with tablets and phones. Really enjoyed this aspect of the film.

Allison Williams delivered a pretty decent performance; it was nice to see her in another prominent horror role since Get Out. Violet McGraw once again was great as an inspiring child actress; her filmography is beginning to be stacked for her being such a young age. All other performances were quite lackluster, but that is expected in a film of this nature.

Overall, there is not really much more to say. This film is funny, weird, and wildly fun. It's never going to be a standout competitor for award season but there is something to say about the pure entertainment it was able to deliver.

""M3GAN doesn't reinvent the respective subgenre of killer robots or AI that turns against humans, but it kept me entertainingly invested throughout its entire runtime.

Akela Cooper's premise is pushed to its limits - and even beyond - being elevated by excellent performances, a clever satirical narrative, eyebrow-raising killings, and meaningful messages about parenting and technology's role in a child's upbringing. It doesn't take itself too seriously or tries to be more than what it truly is.

I was conflicted before seeing the movie. On the one hand, the trailer looked ridiculous. On the other, I knew that Blumhouse and James Wan partnered for this. After seeing the reviews, I finally accepted that I had to see this movie, and I’m glad I did. Was it ridiculous? Absolutely. M3GAN knew what it was. It knew it was cheesy but had fun with it while also cranking up the tension and suspense. So many cliche “stop standing there and do something” moments that surprisingly added to the stress and horror. I wouldn’t say the movie was ever scary, but it was an excellent thriller. It’s a fun Blumhouse film that was self-aware and goofy while creepy and tense. One of my favorite parts was the short scene with one of the worst detectives of all time that had me laughing out loud in the theater.

Indeed, actually, at times I found it particularly useful (the neighbour's wayward dog, for example). It's a competently strung together drama, but it's all just a little too sterile and by-the-numbers for me.

536554,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**It's an enjoyable film, it carries a pertinent anti-tech message, but it's not even close to being a horror film.**

First, let me make one thing clear: horror movies have an imperative duty to scare and disturb us. Tension, suspense, fear and some scares are something that should not be missing. It's the essence of horror cinema, right? So, can someone explain to me where came from the bad idea of making horror movies for teenagers who aren't old enough to ride a motorcycle? Don't get me wrong… the movie is good, and I liked it, but I can't consider it a horror movie. It is not able to frighten anyone! It has no scares (we are able to predict them from a mile!), it has no tension or suspense. As a horror movie, forget it. As the people say, it rains, but it doesn't get us wet, do you understand?

The script begins with a young girl who loses her parents in a tragic accident and goes to live with an aunt who works in a large corporation of highly technological toys. Things aren't easy and neither of them is prepared for the situation. It is in this context that we met M3GAN, a prototype of a toy that is, basically, an android child that is capable of learning, improving itself, teaching and, basically, replacing parents in the tiring task of… being parents. The problem is that, being a machine, it has no notion of good or bad, right or wrong, and that seems to have been a secondary detail in its programming. So it's no surprise that she quickly turns into a sly, cynical creature who kills without any remorse.

The film was directed by Gerard Johnstone, an illustrious unknown. Who is behind the project is the producer and screenwriter James Wan, who we know from “Saw” and “Conjuring 2”. Wan's brand is everywhere. It would have been better if he had directed it and the project had evolved into a somber film, a true horror piece. Allison Williams does the main character well, giving us yet another excellent job. The actress is living a happy moment in her professional life after having shone in “Get Out” and seems to be managing to take advantage of the opportunities. Amie Donald and Jenna Davis, in turn, give body and voice (respectively) to M3GAN, complementing the work with an animatronic doll created for this purpose.

The animatronic doll is nothing new. Cinema has used this technology for decades, and Spielberg's shark – one of the first and most infamous examples – is proof of that. However, the special effects and CGI are to be congratulated. The film utilizes a number of expensive visual and digital resources to excellent effect, wonderfully complementing what was done in the studio. The sound (particularly the sound effects related to the doll) also deserves praise, and the cinematography, even though it doesn't bring new or innovative features, makes the best use of it all. The film has good costumes and convincing sets, as well as a very good, modern and fun soundtrack. It's on the editing table that things go wrong: either because of the excessive length, or because it wants to target young age groups, the film was badly edited, and the cuts are rough. There are even scenes from the trailer that, because they are not in the final cut, make it difficult to understand the story: for example, the scene where Gemma orders M3EGAN to protect Cady, which appears in the trailer and was cut from the film, but which would help to understand why the doll starts to behave that way to protect its young owner.

The only real fear that this film conveys is the credible possibility that, in the medium term, there will be some toy similar to M3GAN. Advances in AI, computing, robot creation and design, or other technologies make it plausible. Will it be that one day we will have robots and androids that, due to their characteristics, will be considered alive and, as such, immortal and, therefore, superior to the humans who created them? I don't think anyone wants to see that. Therefore, the film carries with it a message of distrust in technology, visible not only in M3GAN, but also in Cady's technological dependence. I can do nothing but applaud: the generations born after the year 2000 saw their childhood dominated by cell phones, iPads or computers, to the point of despising conventional games and toys and alienating themselves from living together, normal and healthy, with other children. I'm not making it up, this is a fact that we can all see in a short trip to any school. And if there are parents who appreciate the creation of devices that keep their children busy, I am in the group of parents who see technology as something that should be dosed in a more measured way, allowing children a normal childhood before introducing them to the digital and tech world. I think there is a time for everything in life, and childhood shouldn't be spent looking at screens and LCDs.",2023-05-27T08:22:30.863Z,7.0,M3GAN,2022

The look is good, the effects are very convincing and, unexpectedly, the dialogue really adds to the character; it is lively and amusing, which can't always be said in this genre. They could've perhaps made the robot more unsettling, though it is minorly creepy once or twice.

Allison Williams, despite my lack of overt interest in the older folk, is solid in a prominent role. She looks like Amanda Peet to me in this, I even had to check it wasn't Peet; even though I knew the years/ages totally didn't work. Violet McGraw is decent. Less said about Ronny Chieng, the better.

536554,RalphRahal,"M3GAN is a fun mix of sci-fi, horror, and satire, playing on our growing fascination (and fear) of AI. The plot is simple but effective, following a tech-driven story that doesn’t waste much time on deep explanations. Instead, it throws us straight into the chaos of a hyper-intelligent AI doll bonding with a child in ways that quickly spiral out of control. While the movie touches on interesting themes about technology and parenting, it doesn't go too deep into the mechanics of M3GAN’s creation, which leaves some questions unanswered. That being said, it still delivers an engaging and entertaining ride.

The directing keeps things moving at a steady pace, balancing horror and humor well. The cinematography is solid, with some nice shots that make M3GAN feel eerily lifelike. The use of lighting and framing helps create an unsettling atmosphere, especially when the doll is in focus. The acting is a mixed bag, while the young girl and the actress behind M3GAN absolutely carry the film, some of the supporting performances feel flat. There are moments where certain characters feel like they’re reading off a script rather than delivering natural dialogue, which can take you out of the moment.

The script is decent, with some sharp moments of humor and tension, but it could have used a bit more depth in certain areas, especially around M3GAN’s development and motivations. The sound design and score work well in building suspense, adding to the film’s creepy but playful tone.

126889,CraigJamesReview,"Alien Covenant marks the third Alien movie directed by Ridley Scott and the second prequel to the franchise after Prometheus. They also seem to be getting worse with age.

Prometheus was really a lot of questions searching for answers, ambitious in asking not only about the creation of alien life, but human life as well. However the plan to stretch out these topics into 3 or 4 movies should be met with some skepticism.

Especially considering the basis for this was started by Damon Lindeloff, the creator of Lost and the man most of us are still waiting for answers for most of the things that happened on Lost.

He of course has abandoned this second movie, leaving it in the hands of the far more capable John Logan, but even he struggles to find meaning here, or escape the clichés that have started to grow like a Xenomorph in John Hurt's stomach.

We're dealing with a whole new crew this time; the Covenant. They are headed on a colonial mission to another planet before an electric shock takes out the ship, the Captain, and 47 other members.

Reluctant to get back into their pods for a 7 year journey, the on board crew responsible for the ship's upkeep decide instead to answer a distress transmission coming from another planet.

That's where they find what continues to be the best character in these prequels; Michael Fassbender's David the Android. His motivations and whether he considers himself human or God is constantly in question and Fassbender's soft-spoken performance continues to haunt.

I also really do consider Prometheus to be one of the most gorgeous-looking special films of the last decade and this continues that- from the Covenant ship to the grain fields and other vegetation eerily covering the mostly desolate other terrain of the planet.

We also get the first look at the Neo-morph, who is born the same way, seems a bit faster than the Xeno-morph but the main differences are it doesn't have the Venus fly trap tongue and it can stand like a human. Pretty cool.

Just it's at this point I should probably say that after Aliens there started to be less reason to want these. Alien 3 was fine, Prometheus I thought could really go either way depending on the sequels, and Alien 4 of course was garbage.

The biggest problem here is that it feels so redundant. We get a distress call, the crew investigates, some background characters do stupid things leading to impregnation, someone says ""we never should have come"", final alien chase.

The aliens, when you can see them, are cool, but there is a lot of downtime between them, and a few quality kills does not a 200 million dollar mega blockbuster make.

It's also really odd that Prometheus does this whole thing of setting up the engineers as the creators of human beings but here they only get one scene and let's just say those looking for more info about them will get angry.

The promise of some larger conversation is in here somewhere but these movies feel so stretched out at this point that when this does get to the few moments of actually having something to say, it's hard to get re-engaged.

The characters don't help either as most just come off like archetypes. Katherine Waterston is the Captain's widow and really the bargain basement Ellen Ripley here.

Billy Crudup plays the faith-based character, and like the last movie, this movie seems to be including that without ever really giving it value in the meaning of life conversation.

But at least those two have some background. I'm so tired of most of these others. The ones who just go tramping through the woods of an unknown planet or show the decision making skills of the Trump administration. You're not supposed to make us root for the alien, guys.

Finally i'm no closer to understanding why these movies are necessary. It's easy to tell what this movie wants to do and it's even easier to see the twist coming a half hour before it even comes.

There are a few nice kills here, I will give the movie that. If you can remember to wake yourself every time Fassbender and Fassbender (he also plays an android named Walter) have a philosophy conversation, you might find some interesting stuff there too.

126889,Gimly,"I had a few reservations going in to _Alien: Covenant_. In my opinion there hasn't been a truly great entry to the franchise since _Aliens_, so I was worried that the statistics were against it. I thought _Prometheus_ was incredible from a technical standpoint, but not a very engaging movie, and I was worried we might get the same here. The trailers had been mostly good but I was worried I had seen too much of the third act in them, and I was worried this would spoil the experience for me a little.

What I was not worried about was within ten minutes of the damn thing starting I would think to myself: ""Wow, this movie is really poorly made.""

Well I guess I'm an idiot because that is exactly what happened. And that feeling never entirely abated over the course of the whole thing.

Don't get me wrong, it's no ""_AVP: Requiem_"", but I was still very disappointed.

I love my films dripping with self importance and this one is definitely one of them.  I can't get enough of these films that positively bubble over with a high handed, serious and arrogant attitude that indicates that there is no film quite as important as this one.


This film knows it all. It knows everything that we- the lowly, pathetic and simple minded audience do not know and could not ever possibly know because we are not intelligent enough to grasp anything, you see?

For such an authoritative, superior and intelligent film - I find it odd that every character stumbles around like a simple minded cretin making unwise decision after unwise decision.


Ridley and his scriptwriters seem to think that they are intellectuals but somehow they just _can't pull off_ the role of **being** an intellectual.

Its a sci-fi/horror flick, I was looking forward to Sir Ridley Scott coming up with new and disgusting ways to terrorize the cast and I wasn't disappointed.  Of course, the android going rogue was pretty obvious, but if the Star Wars franchise can feature a planet destroying space station in 3 of 7 movies, I'll give Sir Ridley a pass.  If you are looking for the loose ends from Prometheus to be tied up, I suggest you include Sir Ridley in your prayers so he can survive long enough (the man is friggin 80) to film the prequel to _Covenant_ currently titled _Awakening_ that will hopefully meet your expectations.",2017-08-04T00:07:27.116Z,,Alien: Covenant,2017
126889,Mark Rushow,"Watched Alien: Covenant a 3rd time. It is a lot better than first meets the eye. The drastic difference from what we were expecting in direction from Prometheus threw all of us off. We had expectations of what we would get to see and we didn't get those. There is so much detail and such good acting. It takes multiple watches to pick up on it all. It blends the styles of Alien, Aliens, and Prometheus all together and does it very well. There is also a lot of subtle reference to Terminator 2. The dynamic between the androids Walter and David and the acting that went into that is something quite special. In that alone is a reference to T:2. My first 2 watches I didn't appreciate the android Walter like the character deserves. I was biased against his character in light of the android David. The android Walter and how he was portrayed also blends the style of android we see in Aliens. The actor's voice and demeanor reflect that of the android Bishop and gives us a bridge to his design. Michael Fassbender really did one hell of a job acting those two parts of Walter and David. Near the end of the movie there is another nod to T:2 as a beam is clearly marked as such and the scene that follows has a strong T:2/Aliens sequence and taste in styling to it. Through and through the acting is very good. Details are abound everywhere. There are a few points of rather convenient plots however overall the film is now among my favorites right along side Aliens and T:2.",2017-08-04T09:18:06.121Z,10.0,Alien: Covenant,2017
126889,John Chard,"Even the monkeys stood upright at some point.

Hee! Ridley Scott, it seems, is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't as regards the Alien franchise he so gloriously kick-started back in 1979. Prometheus was too cerebral for many and definitely bogged down by expectation levels. Not without flaws of course, but a very tidy science fiction piece it be. So we roll on to Alien Covenant, which while not universally reviled, has certainly garnered some fearful scorn in Alien franchise fan circles.

Alien Covenant is a cover version, no two ways about it, it's a retread of what was showcased in 1979, only with the tie-in to Prometheus and a continuation to the origins of Xenomorph and pals. Clearly we have a case of Scott making one for the fans, a return to chest busting goo and space adventurers under great duress, all of course while he fills in the blanks as well. For sure it's lazy when put up against Alien, and indeed against his other superlative sci- fi offerings such as Blade Runner and The Martian, but for those who lambasted Prometheus for its non Alien conventions, you have now got what you hankered for. Any expectation of this turning out to be a fresh masterpiece was always going to be crushed, so really it's best viewed as a loving retread. Yes! Bad science, plot and logic holes, average acting etc, these rightly don't deserve forgiveness, but it's hardly the devil's spawn here, in fact its's great fun as much as being a visual treat.

Log cabin on the lake.

We start with a prologue involving Weyland and David, the conversation involving creation, the most pertinent of which being the question of the ages, where do we come from? Then after a tantalising tinkle of the ivories for Wagner's ""The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla"", we are whisked into outer space 2104 to be in the company of the Colonisation Vessel Covenant. Crew 15 - Colonists 2000 - Embryos 1140. The destination is ORIGAE - 6, ETA in 7 years and 4 months. Only Walter the Android (Michael Fassbender) is awake, until it's time for the crew to be abruptly awakened from their hyper sleep...

Crusoe and the pathogen.

From the off disaster strikes, thrusting the crew into emotional strife. Characters are introduced, conversations and traits establishing the bare minimum that we need to know, then a ghost transmission is received from Sector 87, planet number 4, and off we go into familiar territory. Things inevitably go from bad to worse and the action, blood flow and creature feature conventions are all laid out for our digestion. There's some surprises in store, with Fassbender a double bonus, and there's some striking chatter ranging from if there's benefits of the human race? and even that involving the poets Byron and Shelley.

Bed Bugs.

Who will survive? If anyone? Just what does the finale have in store? As we get devilish answers, and the barn storming aural pleasures of the full orchestral version of ""The Entry Of The Gods Into Valhalla"", it's tied up nicely and the pulse rate can settle. Job done. No bar raising here, no film to push the space lander out into new dimensions, just a good honest sci-fi thriller to be viewed with that in mind. 7/10",2017-09-23T09:32:03.935Z,7.0,Alien: Covenant,2017
126889,Reno,"**Good robot! Bad robot!**

After some gaps, the 'Alien' franchise came alive with the prequel 'Prometheum' which originally said to be a spin-off. Particularly, it landed in the hands of the original maker. Now, even the original title back in action. It's another prequel, hence the prequel series on the making. The next film too will be the same kind, before the overall storyline in the franchise align in a straight line.

I enjoyed it. But not as good as 'Prometheum' or the first two 'Alien' films. The issue with it was, the same old cliché. There's nothing in the story. It was like any space film that's set in a similar fashion. The 80 per cent of the film was what we had seen in the earlier 'Alien' films. Just altered scenes with a new cast and a great visuals. So the update makes it the special.

The story focused too much on the robot. The alien parts were reduced. Because it was like the first appearance of the original aliens we saw in the old films. Precisely to say, the origins. Genetic modification, crossbreeding, there comes the beast. From this film what I have learnt was, it was nothing but more or less the same old fear the humans have about that the robots which are the ones going to make humans go extinct. Except here the aliens come between them. Hence, falling prey to the same clichéd theme from any sci-fi that had humanoid.

Nevertheless, well maintained film in its balance coming from previous hits in the series and going forward to bring more hits. This flick would serve as a fine bridge between them. So only 18 years to go between this, from 2104 to 2122. I'm already anticipating the next film. As I have heard, that film would be focused more on the robot. That's going to be a different experience. Fassbender's time to have some space adventures.

The whole point of the game, though, is that they do have a chance, if they can think quickly enough on their feet and/or play pool upside down. It might well work fine as a video game, but as a feature on screen it's really a lame collection of acting talent delivering increasingly hysterical dialogue in an environment for which I was heartily cheering from the moment I met ""Ben"" (Logan Miller), ""Zoey"" (Taylor Russell) and the rest of a gang of people for whom over-confidence is the order of the day.

522681,RalphRahal,"Escape Room (2019) kicks off with an intriguing premise that instantly hooks you. The movie thrives on its creative and visually impressive room designs, with each puzzle adding layers of tension and suspense. It’s fast-paced and keeps you entertained throughout, making it an enjoyable watch for fans of thrillers and puzzle-based challenges. However, the emotional connection with the characters feels thin, which slightly dampens the impact of the stakes. You’ll root for their survival but probably won’t remember much about them once the credits roll.

The ending, while tying into the sequel, leaves you with a sense of incompleteness, an all-too-common trend in franchise filmmaking that can feel tiresome. Sometimes, you just want a self-contained story that offers closure without setting up the next installment. That said, the movie is still fun for what it is, especially if you’re not expecting deep storytelling.

The story opens with a gripping climax scene before rewinding to reveal character backgrounds—mainly Zoey, Ben, and Jason—and the mysterious escape room’s origins. The main tension arises from how characters reveal their true selves under pressure, with internal and external conflicts tied to their pasts.

The ending shows clear character growth and explains the deadly game while teasing a sequel. Strong visuals, effective camerawork, and fitting sound design deepen the suspense. Supported by solid acting, Escape Room is an engaging thriller worth watching.

4488,tmdb17996075,"Clearly, the team behind “Friday the 13th” expected at least to make a reasonable profit out of it, but I seriously doubt that anyone involved in the making of this film even considered the possibility of it becoming the cult classic that it is today. Victor Miller, who wrote the story, openly admitted that he was riding off the success of Halloween (1978). The late actress Betsy Palmer even claimed that, after reading the script, she thought the story was trash (well… she actually used another word), but she took the job because she needed a new car. Little did she know when she took the role that her character would immortalize her as one of the biggest horror icons of all times.

Yes, it is evident that Victor Miller and Don Mancini capitalized on the success of Halloween (1978), but the truth is that “Friday the 13th” manages to stand out on its own, and in the end, other than being two slasher films about a killer who prowls around murdering teenagers; these two films don’t really have that much in common. To this day, John Carpenter’s “Halloween” is considered a more “serious” horror film (for the lack of a better word), while “Friday the 13th” remains a classic, but is still seen as a less underappreciated respectable flick. Why? Probably because, even though I absolutely love it, I will admit that “Friday the 13th” certainly has a campy nature (no pun intended). In my case, I don’t mind the campiness, I actually enjoy it.

In “Friday the 13th”, the story begins in 1958, in a summer camp named Camp Crystal Lake. We see two young camp counselors who are about to have sex, when someone appears out of nowhere and murders them both. We don’t get to see who the killer is, since the murders are shown in a point-of-view shot, and the reason behind the murders is not yet explained either.
The story then jumps to 1980 and it focuses on Alice, a young and sensible girl who, along with other kids of her age, is hired as a counselor by a man who attempts to reopen Camp Crystal Lake. Unfortunately, someone doesn’t seem too thrilled about the reopening of the place, which will lead to a series of gruesome murders. Could it be the same person who killed those two counselors back in 1958? In the end, it is Alice who will have to come face to face with the killer and fight for her own life.

*Spoilers ahead*

Plot-wise, “Friday the 13th” may not be too remarkable, but it doesn’t really need to be either. I could be wrong, but I believe this film first introduced the formula that consists on: a summer camp as a scenario, a pinch of mystery, plentiful gore, creative deaths and a gratifying reveal towards the last minutes. Just like this film attempted to ride off the success of a previous slasher, ironically, “Friday the 13th” itself ended up generating a bunch of (arguably) inferior clones as well. Of course, commercial success doesn’t necessarily imply quality, but I do think “Friday the 13th” has a certain something that makes it appealing to a lot of people.

For the most part, the characters in this film seem somewhat generic and one dimensional, which is a common attribute in slasher films. There really isn’t much of a character development, and we don’t get to know them very well. Most of the victims are young boys and girls who seem to be in the camp to have a good time themselves, rather than working hard to make the children happy. Surely, these characters don’t really deserve to die for being immature and silly, but at the same time, it is hard to feel too bad for them either. However, the first character that gets killed after the time-jump seems genuinely sweet and caring, so one obviously feels bad for her when she is brutally murdered, just for being naïve enough to trust a stranger. I think this death after the time-jump was a perfect move, because it sets the tone perfectly for what is going to happen later: a bunch of innocent young people will be brutally murdered without having done anything to deserve it. 

The acting in “Friday the 13th” is mostly plain or, in some cases, over the top, which, along with the silly dialogs and lines, provides the film with an enjoyable campy nature. The late Betsy Palmer, who played the role of Mrs. Pamela Voorhees, was nominated for a Razzie Award, and while I love the character of Mrs. Voorhees and I felt bad to hear about Palmer’s passing, I can understand why she was nominated. It’s true, Betsy’s portrayal of Jason’s mother is over the top and it can appear as unintentionally funny during her delivery of some of her lines, but at the same time, I’m not sure if I can imagine the character being played differently at this point. Then we have Crazy Ralph, literally jumping out of a closet, telling the kids to leave, because they’re doomed and that Camp Crystal Lake has a death curse. This character, aside from being called “Crazy” Ralph, (in case anyone didn’t notice that he was crazy in the first place), is perhaps one of the campiest characters in the slasher subgenre, which earned him an iconic place in the franchise and even a small part in the first sequel.

“Friday the 13th” offers a nice variety of gory murders, with Tom Savini in charge of the makeup effects, which is an undeniable seal of quality. The legendary “axe in the face” death scene is perhaps one of the most memorable parts of the film for many fans. In this scene, Sean Cunningham and Tom Savini not only offer a morbidly satisfying and shocking on-screen death, we also get a lot of tension and suspense preceding the murder, which creates a feeling of panic and desperation. 

The final confrontation between Alice, our final girl, and Mrs. Voorhees, Jason’s vengeful mother is really extensive for a good cause, as it helps to build a lot of tension that culminates with a gruesome murder. To some extent, when Mrs. Voorhees suddenly appears out of nowhere and begins to tell the story of what happened to that “poor boy”, it is easy to assume that she is responsible for the carnage, or at least, that she is involved to a certain degree. Up until this point, we had never seen her before throughout the entire film, so why is she popping out now? There are no other supporting characters left to blame for the murders and Mrs. Voorhees shows up the exact moment when things got really ugly? What could she be doing at Camp Crystal Lake in the middle of the night, other than murdering boys and girls? Of course, our final girl, even though she is not unintelligent, seems to be somewhat oblivious of what is really happening and this is what makes up want to scream “Get out of there!”. Mrs. Voorhees is basically explaining the whole story to the audience, but at the same time, she is subtly revealing herself as the killer, before going into a weird trance, in which she starts talking as if she is possessed by Jason, her own son, who drowned at the lake (I always considered this like a switched version of Norman Bates and his mother). 

As mentioned before, the acting in this final confrontation is not exactly brilliant and the audience ends up getting more than they probably needed to understand the story, since Mrs. Voorhees’ monologue basically goes into detail of what happened, just to make sure we get it right (just like when they make sure that we understand that Ralph is a crazy old man, by calling him “Crazy Ralph”). Regardless of the over the top acting and the spoon-feeding to the audience, the confrontation is full of tension, and it is still considered one of the most memorable “killer reveal” moments in the history of horror for a good reason.",2017-02-20T04:42:06.787Z,8.0,Friday the 13th,1980

4488,Wuchak,"***The beginning of the most successful slasher franchise***

Released in May, 1980, ""Friday the 13th"" was produced in the wake of the success of 1978's ""Halloween"" and also shares elements of ""Carrie"" (1976) and ""A Bay of Blood"" (1971). The story revolves around a cursed summer vacation spot, Camp Crystal Lake, New Jersey, and the slayings of young camp counselors. Critics slammed the film and I'm not sure why since it's in the same league as the acclaimed ""Carrie"" and ""Halloween."" Regardless, it was hugely popular at the box office, making far more than any of the sequels until ""Freddy vs. Jason"" in 2003. As of this writing there are 12 movies in the franchise and another in the works, making it the most successful slasher series and one of the most successful franchises of any genre.

I'm not a gorehound at all and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. Why? It has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories; the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer, who becomes more and more of a hideous monster, just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end.

Speaking of the women, this first movie is highlighted by Annie (Robbi Morgan), Alice (Adrienne King) and Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) with honorable mention to Brenda and Claudette, the latter from the opening 1958 segment. As far as dudes go, a youthful Kevin Bacon is on hand as one of the counselors.

As for the filming locations, this one was shot in the remote townships of Hardwick, Blairstown & Hope, New Jersey. It's interesting how none of the films were shot at the same location even though, typically, the location in the story is Camp Crystal Lake and that general vicinity. Other locations include Connecticut (II & IX), California (III, IV, V), Georgia (VI), Alabama (VII), British Columbia (VIII & XI), New York City (VIII), Toronto (X & XI) and Texas (XII).

It's the camp-like settings of most of the franchise and the unstoppable monster that is Jason Voorhees (and the demonic thing that possesses him, his mother and others, as disclosed in 1993’s “Jason Goes to Hell”) that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.

Concerning the tone, the first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduced a campy element in Part III, which rears its head in several entries (V, VI, IX and X) until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway. Speaking of which, the only thing questionable about this first film, as far as realism goes, is how the killer is able to throw an adult corpse through a window or hang a body from a door, etc. But I suppose these things can be attributed to the powerful psycho Voorhees gene (or the hellish entity that possesses them).

Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, I guess, but, with the exception of the 2009 reboot, I don't usually find these movies particularly scary. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always entertaining, but not scary (although there are numerous jump-scares, of course). In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.

I give ""Friday the 13th"" a high rating because it IS an effective film in the oft-maligned slasher/horror genre, not to mention it’s iconic and kicked-off this amazingly successful franchise. No genre is beyond redemption if done right; and that's the case here.

The film runs 95 minutes.

A family stop off at gas station where the elderly attendant tells them of a dirt track shortcut across the desert that will save them a few hours.

Reduced to just 3, ""Big Bob"" (Ted Levine) and his faithful hound have to track down his kidnapped baby grandchild - a perilous journey indeed. Now quite why they decided to take the shortcut is just one of a few dodgy decision taken by the ""Carter"" family that made me wonder, and rendered the plot increasingly silly as we progress to an ending that seems to drag on a bit too long. That said, there are plenty of jump moments and Alexandre Aja manages to keep the annoyingly screaming hysteria to a minimum. Once it eventually gets going, it becomes decently paced and the photography is tightly cut to maximise the impact of some pretty gruesome scenarios (and prosthetics!).

Dance is slaughtered in the first act, as is the regulation bastard warden (Glover), leaving only Sigourney, impressive as ever, and a motley cast of extras. Though wasteful of the expensive sets, Fincher's tight close-ups do add to the sense of claustrophobic panic.",2016-02-03T18:37:33.179Z,6.0,Alien³,1992

Special Edition.

I love it, I really do. OK! So it's basically a monster on the loose piece, but the setting at a sci-fi prison colony - complete with nutty religious shards - makes for a thrillingly atmospheric ride. Of course if this was merely a stand alone film, where there was no Alien and Aliens previously, I feel sure the special edition cut would be thought of differently. 

A roll call of Brit thesps line up for some tension filled entertainment as director David Fincher and cinematographer Alex Thomson provide a look that is both beautiful and scary. The metallic nightmare of chambers and cold concrete fused together for some hellish stalk and paranoia. Industrial Punk? Steam Punk? Cyber Punk? Fincher Punk? Hey man, we gotta give it a name! And of course there's Siggy Weaver front and center, the reassuring presence among the murderers, rapists and child molesters. 

I could live without the attempt at a transcendent finale, but in extended form this has much to light your fires. It also showed that Fincher would be a director to watch - imagine if had he been left alone to craft his own vision? His subsequent career and standing makes a mockery of the studio execs involved in the making of Alien³. 8/10

Alien 3 returns the franchise to its artistic horror roots established by Ridley Scott. No more Disney kids, happy endings and machine gun wielding irritants.

This movie is a beautifully bleak experience and is the true sequel to Alien (1979). Performances are excellent all round - especially Charles Dance as prison doctor, Clemens, and, of course, Sigourney Weaver - who gives us her best performance as the downtrodden Ripley.

A masterwork by David Fincher that restores the horror and dignity to the series. Thank goodness for Alien 3!

_Mild spoilers:_

Everything has been said about this movie already, but let's find out why the rating of it (on a different, shabbier website) is so low. Here are some points of a popular reviewer, who has almost 100 percent support of their readers.

1. At some points the audience is bored stiff and at other moments they are confused by the outlandish action sequences.

Outlandish action? Was it too alien? And sorry you were bored by the exceptional cinematography, underlined by a pace that was just right not to rush things, which brings me the second point.

2. ...a disjointed mess that feels forced and rushed.

Story seemed linear to me. And which one is it, boring or rushed?

3. The direction is never clear and there is no real screenplay here at all.

This is just saying it was bad, without saying anything at all. How is this helpful.

4. Charles Dutton is pretty good, but his character lacks the development to really make him interesting. Everyone else is just present...

Dutton's character needs no development. What do you want, him finding Jesus again? Dance's backstory is interesting, and we get to know little details about everyone else like for example the IQ of one of the guards who then later unexpectedly gives his life for what he believes in, pretty strong character development for a minor player in a Sci-Fi Thriller. And that is the main problem people have when rating ""Alien³"", they don't know it's not a horror film like ""Alien"" and it's not an action flick like ""Aliens"".

5. Overall a disappointment that is not very impressive at all. 2 stars out of 5.

More bashing without sound reasoning behind it. This film is clearly underrated, and if the aforementioned reviewer had seen what we have seen in 2017, especially in the Science Fiction genre, he might even agree and change his opinion about how a ""disjointed mess"" looks like.

I give 5 stars not to up the overall score, but because ""Alien³"" ends Ripley's ordeal in a stylish and original way, without insulting the intelligence of the viewer, or rehashing previous plot lines.

Sigourney Weaver remains a joy to watch, while Charles S. Dutton and Charles Dance are strong additions; Dutton especially. As for other positives, I enjoyed the score and the fact that we (seemed to) get way more of the alien itself; which is what I wanted from the first two, personally.

The plot isn't the greatest but is very watchable, the ending is pretty good. One criticism I do have is the dialogue, as alluded to at the top of my review. I've nothing against the use of swear words whatsoever, but man does this film overuse the f-word; it feels like every other word across the conclusion.

Overall, it's a definite drop down from the two very good predecessors, though I still got the required entertainment from <em>'Alien³'</em>. A noteworthy directorial film debut for David Fincher.",2022-02-23T02:53:05.533Z,7.0,Alien³,1992
8077,CinemaSerf,"This third instalment in the franchise reverts more to the original, more claustrophobic environment as ""Ripley"" (Sigourney Weaver) crash lands onto a penal colony run by ""Andrews"" (Brian Glover) where the inmates are all pretty unsavoury characters. It's not long after she arrives that one of them gets minced by an huge ventilation fan - but, was he? Her suspicions are further confirmed when one of the guard dogs has a very bad attack of gastroenteritis! With the help of the ex-convict doctor ""Clemens"" (Charles Dance), she has to galvanise her sceptical fellow humans to prepare for the impending onslaught whilst also dealing with some rather horrific personal information too! This has much more of a British feel to it, and that doesn't always work. Glover overacts badly, and Paul McGann, Dance and an out of his depth Danny Webb (""Morse"") don't offer Weaver anything like enough support to create the sense of peril from ""Alien"" (1979). That said, though, the tightly shot photography in the interior scenarios and the deft pace from David Fincher do create quite a sense of menace without the need for gore or excessive special effects.

8077,GenerationofSwine,"At the moment it has 60+% and that makes me happy. I spent a lot of time defending Alien 3 as a stellar addition to the franchise. And, honestly, I think a lot of the hate on it is because of the fate of those that we grew to know and love from Aliens.

The Dog concept was cool. It gave the alien a great new spin. And David Fincher...seriously, his style fits the franchise so well it's unbelievable. It is bleak and stylistic and it fits great into the world of Alien's future...in a Mad Max kind of way.

It was the Alien movie that the 90s deserved, unlike Resurrection.

You have a film that is darker than Aliens and a lot more horror. It fits more into the mold of Alien, with a darker theme. It's a nice departure from the over-the-top Aliens mega block buster action film, and brings the franchise back to it's singular alien ground point.

It works very well. It just followed Aliens and I believe that people were expecting more action, more xenomorphs, more everything. Alien 3 gave you less in the same way that Alien did, and the pay off is there...so long as you don't walk into it expecting space marines.",2023-01-13T23:53:43.215Z,10.0,Alien³,1992
8077,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A film that starts badly cannot end well. Even so, the film has values worth highlighting.**

There is no doubt that the first two films in the “Alien” franchise are classics in their own right and figure in a certain pantheon of the best horror and sci-fi films ever made. These are films where everything went very well, and everything came together in such a way as to make great works of cinema. This film cannot match them, and the reason for this has to do with its origins. As we say in Portugal, what is born crooked never straightens out.

In fact, this film was born and grew under the sign of chaos and confusion, with almost constant discussions between the studio, the producers, director David Fincher and the team responsible for the script. Right from the start, Ridley Scott refused to direct because he understood that it should be tied to the hypothetical origins of the alien (Scott will be able to carry out this idea in his most recent films, “Prometheus” and “Alien Covenant”). Fincher agreed to replace him, but the studio's constant interference in his work led to intense controversies and a very tense atmosphere. Millions were spent on scenes cut and re-filmed as the script was changed and rewrote, and sets were even built that were never used because the script changed. Let's face it: it was virtually impossible to make a great film in the midst of these conflicts.

The film continues the story of Lieutenant Ripley: a mysterious fire forces the ship in which she was traveling to eject the hypersleep capsules. Of the three survivors from the previous film, only she is rescued alive by the inmates of a space penal colony. The place is remote, there are not many inmates, and most have taken refuge in a certain strange spirituality. Ripley will have the help of the resident doctor, who will confirm that there was a live Alien on board the ship where she was, and that the threat is already incubating in that penal colony.

The film has its qualities: the cinematography, the sets and the costumes are excellent and completely match what we have seen in previous films; the sense of threat and tension is still very present, and it is quite effective, although there is no surprise about the Xenomorph's murderous capabilities. The soundtrack, sound effects, editing and special effects are still excellent, notoriously expensive and elaborate. The work done by the actors doesn't leave us dissatisfied either: Sigourney Weaver takes her character, defending her and giving her a development and strength whose responsibility lies, totally and entirely, with the actress, and the way she committed herself to this work. Charles Dance still gives him welcome support, with a job well done, but they are almost alone and the rest of the cast is much weaker than they are. A caveat, however, for the brief appearance of Lance Henrikssen, who does a good job even though he contributes little to the film.

There are, however, some issues that make the film much weaker, and which are linked to the script. One that came to mind while watching the film is how easily the film discards the surviving characters from the previous film, killing them in their sleep. Another thing I thought about was that Xenomorph, even though it's huge and very effective at killing, it's not acting like any animal would normally act. When we observe the natural world, we see that animals only kill for two essential reasons: food and self-defense. The Xenomorph does not. Although he feeds on the humans he kills, he also seems to kill for pleasure, which may betray a certain type of human-like intelligence. The film never explores this, limiting itself to releasing the beast to kill at random. As a horror element, it works, but it lacks the wit that would make things more interesting. The consequences of this, in light of the religious and spiritual issues so dear to prisoners, are also not addressed: we limit ourselves to seeing them in somewhat apocalyptic prayers. And if they are all vile men, ex-murderers and dangerous people, how is it that the film was not able to make them use this violence and “criminal experience” in favor of their own self-defense?",2023-05-01T17:59:10.287Z,7.0,Alien³,1992

340837,PimplyChicken,"My goodness! Two and a half hours of absolute drivel. The worst movie I have seen in a long time. The list of things that are wrong with this movie are almost too many to list. 

First the good: the makers of this movie have obviously paid a lot of attention and have gone to a lot of trouble in the design of the movie. The location and the settings are stunning. The 'spa' where the story takes place is suitably unsettling and creepy. The music also is a highlight. That's where the good ends, unfortunately. 

The plot of this movie is an absolute mess. It seems the producers weren't sure what they were going for: Gothic horror? Dark and quirky? Straight out frightening? As a result, the finished product is none of these things. The movie swings from one improbable scenario to another. New plot elements are introduced with no relation to what has gone before. Several times the movie arrives at what seems to be a conclusion before picking itself up, introducing a hitherto unreferenced, unrelated, unnecessary and unlikely plot 'twist' and then lurching on its demented way. It's almost as if the makers finished the movie and then someone thought of something else to include - often borrowed from another, better movie - and they tacked it on the end. The movie seems interminable. Its two and a half hour run time could have been shortened by an hour and resulted in a somewhat enjoyable story. 

It also doesn't help that the denouement is pretty obvious quite early in the piece or that certain of the plot elements are not really explained properly or that none of the characters are likeable or worthy of the viewer's sympathy or that most of the tension is provided by the music, not by the story or acting.

Seems the films of this director won't survive without Johnny Depp in the lead. Just one good film would change that conception. Is this the one! No, but was very close. After seeing the film I thought it could be based on the novel, but isn't. The writers must be good to create such atmosphere, outside the novel. I was very impressed with the film, though the screenplay lagged the pace. And a few things need to be explained where the narration failed to do so, keeping in mind the average intelligent people. Other than that it is a decent mystery-drama associated with fantasy and sci-fi.

After an unexpected incident, he has to stay a bit longer. In those periods, he comes to realise there's something wrong with the place, hence decides to uncover. Does he really do it! His struggles in the attempt and everything else were told in the remaining part.

Somewhat it reminded me 'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer'. Not until you finish watching it or figure it out the puzzle. Then the BG score was too cliché for such concept, but nothing can be replaced it. The film had a good opening. Even the mid part. But dragged in the latter section. The overall length of the film was another drawback for the narration.

There were no empty scenes, everything's were filled with something, but the end twist was not as phenomenal as promised in the earlier developments. Especially if you had seen a handful of similar masterpieces. It was kind of an old concept, like the pre 80s or something. Yet acceptable at present for being rare. Thus, it depends how well it was made. An above average film, but for those who haven't seen many films in their lives, this will be a great one.

Will they find her in time? 

""The Cell"" (2000) is a psychological crime drama/thriller that combines “The Silence of the Lambs” (1991) with “The Matrix” (1999) and the style of Francis Ford Coppola’s “Dracula” (1992); meanwhile the sordid elements recall “The General’s Daughter” (1999). Although the plot seems convoluted, the film is actually easy to follow and it’s a veritable feast for the eyes. 

The best ‘feast’ is Jennifer in her prime. Also on the female front is Catherine Sutherland as one of the victims.

How about just hinting at it or describing it verbally?

There's been some controversy over 2010's ""Black Death."" The film has been interpreted in every which way by Christians, pagans, religionists, agnostics and atheists. Either its message is too deep or it's just ambiguous.

I believe I have it figured out and will share evidence at the end of this review.

THE PLOT: The year is 1348 and England is plagued by the Black Death. The Roman Church learns of a remote village that has eluded the plague and suspect sorcery. They send their knight Ulrich (Sean Bean) and a team of hardened soldiers to investigate. On the way they enlist a young monk to lead them to the village, Osmund (Eddie Redmayne), but he has ulterior motives in taking the assignment: He hopes to reunite with Averill, a girl who took sanctuary in the monastery but recently left due to the plague. The monk and the soldiers are all professing believers, but will their faith withstand the ultimate testing?

The film has high production values and was shot in NE Germany.

The story pulls you in before the first act is over. But it's the final act where the film's greatness really emerges. This part of ""Black Death"" took me by surprise and reveals that it's not really a film about the Black Death, at least not literally. The era of the bubonic plague is just a stage for a grueling exploration into personal belief in God, whether true faith or false.

Two important characters are introduced in the second half: Hob (Tim McInnerny) and the beautiful Langiva (Carice van Houten), the authorities of the village. Carice is exceptional.

A couple sequences show true cinematic excellence: A scene where Langiva leads Osmund out into the night marsh for an amazing revelation, and later when Osmund searches through the misty reeds while Langiva conveys the awful truth.

The lengthy water-pit sequence also stands out just for being so excruciating and is on par with the initial Russian roulette sequence in ""The Deer Hunter"" but with more meaning since the outcome in ""Black Death"" hinges on the victims' faith or lack of faith and the everlasting outcome. If Christianity is true, those who denounce their faith have nothing but eternal black death to look forward to.

""Black Death"" runs 1 hour, 42 minutes, and is reminiscent of films like ""Witchfinder General,"" ""The Wicker Man,"" ""The Last Valley,"" “Season of the Witch” and maybe ""Ravenous."" ""Black Death"" is as good or IMHO better.

GRADE: A

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)

MY EXPLANATION:

Osmund was never a believer. He may have had some positive qualities but he simply wasn't a believer and the clues are there from the very beginning: For one, he was fornicating with his girlfriend and jumped on the first excuse to leave the monastery so he could see her again (using prayer and a ""sign from God"" as a cover – even a cover for his own delusion). In fact, Averill told him, ""You've ALREADY betrayed God."" Secondly, Dalywag points out that his purpose as a torturer was to sniff out lies and tells Osmund to his face that he's a lie. Speaking of Dalywag, despite his gruff exterior and occupation, he later proves his genuine faith as the first person to be crucified for it. Thirdly, Langiva (the red witch) said she looked into the eyes of each visitor when they arrived and saw that Osmund was the only one who wasn't out to harm them, meaning she pegged the others as believers, but not Osmund. Remember, the ""eyes are the windows of the soul."" Fourthly, although Osmund didn't vocalize his denouncement of God he readily got out of the water pit to view his girlfriend in the cottage. Fourthly, Osmund openly disagreed with Ulrich and the soldiers about Langiva and the villagers. Why? Because he was actually one of them, an unbeliever, whether he knew it or not. And lastly, the end plainly shows what became of Osmund: He became a lifeless and bitter false accuser who cruelly tortured and slew in the name of the church. Remember, Jesus said you can recognize false prophets by their fruits (Matthew 7:15-23).

Some object to Osmund being a fake believer on the grounds that he was a monk and lived in a monastery, not to mention he prayed. But these things don't make you a believer any more than being in a garage makes you a vehicle. True belief is a matter of the heart, not putting on airs of religiosity, like the Pharisees whom Jesus denounced as fakes.

The very first sign that Osmund wasn't a true believer was his seduction by Averill's beauty and his subsequent unrepentant spirit. At the end of the film when Hob is apprehended and caged he's asked why he follows the red witch and he replies, ""Because she's beautiful."" Hence, both Hob and Osmund were alike in that they renounced faith due to the seduction of beauty.

Although depicted as brutal witch-hunters, Ulrich and his team were RIGHT regarding their suspicions of the marsh village – the people HAD renounced God and witchcraft WAS being practiced, albeit in a partially charlatan form. Of course it's wrong to persecute people simply because they don't believe in God or adhere to pagan beliefs, but this was a different time and place, when the Roman Church was the state religion.

Although Swire proved to be a fake believer and is actually an obvious type of Judas, Ulrich, Wolfstan, Dalywag and the other surviving soldiers proved their genuine faith and escaped the ""black death"" of eternal death.

The idea that Osmund was the protagonist is a red herring. Ulrich and Wolfstan – gruff and flawed as they are – are the true protagonists of ""Black Death."" Besides his courageousness in the face of martyrdom, Ulrich cries out to the villagers in no uncertain terms, ""Repent before it's too late – Repent!""

13122,tmdb28039023,"The plot follows a boy and two adult thieves who, after breaking in to steal a collection of rare coins, become trapped in a house belonging to a strange couple. These thieves are so inept they leave their van parked next to the house, in full view of a couple of policemen who are even more inept; “This truck was used to rob a liquor store last night,” they inform the homeowners, whereupon they just drive off, leaving the getaway vehicle right where it is (but then cops are always incompetent in a Wes Craven film; cf. The Last House on the Left).

The inside of the house, which appears to have been designed by serial killer H.H. Holmes, is full of booby traps, including a door whose knob has been rigged to deliver electric shocks – in one hilarious scene, young Fool (Brandon Quintin Adams) grabs the doorknob with one hand while holding Leroy's (Ving Rhames) hand with the other; Leroy’s other hand is currently between a Rottweiler’s fangs, and the electrical charge travels through the two intruders and knocks out the dog.

The People Under the Stairs is like a Scooby Doo episode with a lot more blood in it; it’s indeed so ludicrous that the stolen coins are meant to pay for “mom's operation.” Having said that, there’s no question it was Craven’s intention all along to make a comedy. Moreover, it's impossible not to have a soft spot for a movie that includes a kid punching a Rottweiler in the face, an homage to The Shining, and the aforementioned dog going on an unexpected ride down a homemade slide, all in the space of just over three minutes.",2022-08-27T02:10:18.313Z,6.0,The People Under the Stairs,1991

The first word I said after the watch was 'unbelievable'. That means the movie is not bad, but how come I missed it for this long. This is the best dark-fantasy movie I have seen recently. But earlier, I thought it would be like the movie 'Tusk' which made me a little uncomfortable to watch. So in the end, what's the difference between the tusk and/or the horn. Both come in a pair and animals have it to defend themselves from the threat. When I watched that movie, I lost interest in this. Yep, it is a silly reason and now I feel bad for that.

This movie dominated by the British cast, especially for having Daniel Radcliffe and Juno Temple I thought it was British film, actually it was not. It was a Canadian-US jointly produced, adapted from a book of the same name and directed by 'Mirror' director. The story was so good, not genuine, though explored the theme very well. For every few minutes later, the narration was taking a turn and that made the plot to get lot tighter before heading for the concluding part.

Maybe this the best movie of Radcliffe that I've seen after his goodbye to 'Harry Potter' movie series. I don't think he's a chocolate boy type, but this kind of movie suits him well. I think he should get muscles for more movie like this, but his height is another negative factor. The film was entirely shot in Canada, the photography was great, music as well as performances. Even those settings like woods, tree house feels kind of wet English and Scottish atmosphere that fits for a devilish mythical charactered movie like this. I regret for reviewing it so delayedly, but anyway I did it and over it, so I hope you watch it very soon as well if you haven't seen it yet.

Well shot and directed, Daniel Radcliffe is the best thing about it, but it lacked the punch and dark humour of the novel. Juno Temple's character feels painfully underwritten, as do most of the 2nd tier characters. The worst part is it takes itself way too seriously for such a silly premise. There is some destructive chaotic fun, but not enough of it. The creature design for the finale is very cool, then the film just sort of stops rather than giving a satisfying wrap up.

Trigger warning: rape and murder.

It's in the premise, but certain information sources hide some things more than others.

Some movies are hurt by trying to be too many things, but this finds a wonderful balance between a murder mystery and religiously mythical.  I think it is that they compliment each other.  Regardless of why Daniel Radcliffe's character has been imbued with horns, the powers he gains serve toward revealing the mystery.  I never felt like there was a dead spot where the story wasn't moving forward or we were re-hashing all the details: they do a good job of keeping the relevant information at the fore front and refreshing the information on pace.

Why it is a great premise, it is awfully sad one, but I do feel it helps humanize Daniel Radcliffe almost immediately, and he retains his like-ability throughout the film just for the shear insanity of his situation.

A young man in a mountain town outside Seattle (Daniel Radcliffe) is accused of murdering his beloved girlfriend (Juno Temple). As he maintains his innocence, he seeks to find the truth while curiously growing horns and learning the innermost secrets of the town’s citizens.

""Horns” (2013) is a crime drama/fantasy with elements of horror and black comedy. It was based on the novel by Stephen King’s son, Joe Hill, and so has that King flavor à la “Needful Things” (1993), just with more modern production values. Like that movie, this one emphasizes the secret carnal impulses that lie just below the surface in any community. When given full reign they cause destruction and misery.

Besides Juno on the female front, Kelli Garner plays a friend of the protagonist who’s secretly in love with him while Heather Graham is on hand as a pathological liar.

I’d give this a higher rating, but the ending is needlessly long and there’s some seriously contrived writing concerning someone’s response to cancer (you’ll see what I mean). Moreover, there’s an overdone ‘gay’ scene in a police car that’s just eye-rolling. It could be argued, however, that this was in keeping with the flick’s penchant for exaggerating things to comical effect.

It's shocking to find how much this film was underrated. Certainly it is not a fairytale like from the Disney production. That mean not for the children, but for the adults. Based on the collections of tales by some 17th century Italian poet. All the tales blended together so well, You won't even feel the familiarity with the original tale, because the modifications were at its best. So I appreciate the writer first, and then the director, followed by the actors.

Since the film has a multiple story narrative layer, like three, the opening and the ending was common to all. But soon after the initiative, the tales go separate ways with its own twists and turns and conclusion, till again falling back in the line to finish it off the film. First a royal couple tend to do anything to have their own child. After many years, having no luck with the pregnancy, they now follow the instruction given by a necromancer. The result is most certain, but not without a negative effect.

The desperate couple sacrifices greater to have a child. The remaining story takes place in the few years later where a royal born child and his mother have differences. A fresh complication arises that puts the mother again in a tight spot. How it is going to be solved narrated in the following parts.

In the second story, the king of a hill castle is obsessed with his new insect pet. That leads him to neglect his own daughter who is dreaming of getting married and have a great life. But the things are not going well between father and daughter with her mother's absence. When the king comes to realise that, he comes with an agenda to achieve two things in one shot. That does not please his daughter, and soon she ends up in the hands of an ogre. The remaining is to tell us what happens to her in a thrilling way.

This is the story of a father's responsibility. If his wife was alive, their daughter would have been taken care at best. Compared to the others, this tale gets more exciting and edgy, even the locations. Of course they have used blue/green screens, but still beautiful like the one from the top of the castle scene. I liked the casting for this, particularly the princess part.

> ""The equilibrium of the world must be maintained.""

The third tale is about a lustful king. One day when he hears a woman singing in a beautiful voice, the next minutes he lands on her home's front door, not knowing the woman is aged and has the wrinkle skin. But she and her sisters play along hiding behind the door and asks for a favour in order to win them back, I mean one of them. So how the rest of the story develops and who gets what, followed by a twist, it comes to an end.

It is a spectacular film. But not visually as the fairy tales told in the present Hollywood films. Particularly, it minimised the computer related special effects. So it was more realistic, yet you will get that fantasy feel with how the tales shape up. It's a black comedy, and that's an absolutely well done part. You know designing the dark humours are not an easy task and this film has three layers, though not all of them has them. The conclusions were so perfect, reminds us the happy and sad are the parts of our life.

Over two hours long film, there's no drag in the narration. The length is because of the three tales and each one was narrated with a pretty good pace. But still it gives the impression the film is slow and that's for being silent like less background score in the most of the parts. From Salma Hayek to Toby Jones, Vincent Cassel, all were so good. The casting was the advantage for the film to shape up well. Since it is an international project, that will help the global audience to their comfort.

The director's first English language film and I think I'm going to keep an eye on his future projects. Certainly I have not seen such film like this, not in the todays cinema. The film was like in the old days. It does not deliver a couple of quick jokes and/or breathtaking visual effects, but the depth of the tale was good. The writers, director did not hesitate to add extra minutes to get what they wanted. I would have liked it if another layer of the tale was included and extended for another 30 or more minutes. For the grown ups, I suggest it not to miss, you won' get a film like this often.

17898,Wuchak,"Quaint comic book werewolf flick by Stephen King

RELEASED IN 1985 and directed by Daniel Attias, ""Silver Bullet"" chronicles events in a small town in Eastern America when a ferocious werewolf starts picking people off one-by-one. Corey Haim and Megan Follows play the adolescent brother/sister protagonists, the boy being a paraplegic. Gary Busey appears as the amiable alcoholic uncle while Robin Groves plays the mother. Everett McGill is on hand as a prominent minister while Terry O'Quinn appears as the sheriff.

Stephen King wrote both the novella and the screenplay and so the movie has the comic book vibe of movies based on King’s works. The townspeople are unsurprisingly cartoonish, but the main family is well done, i.e. realistic. In any case, “Silver Bullet” seems quaint compared to the three werewolf flicks of 1981: “The Howling,” “An American Werewolf in London” and “Wolfen” (of course the latter wasn’t strictly a werewolf flick, if at all). Nevertheless, I appreciate the old fashioned take on the subject and the warmth of the family members. The werewolf is Grade B when fully revealed, but certainly formidable. 

The film conveys cinematic stereotypes, like the goodhearted drunk (or prostitute) and the corrupt civic leader, who puts on a fake smile for the community while being a savage beast within. Although there’s some truth to these depictions, most of the time a drunkard is an alcoholic because his/her heart is desperately flawed. And the bulk of respected community leaders aren’t evil incarnate. Yet I like the way the movie shows how everything is not necessarily as it appears.            

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot in North Carolina (Burgaw, Leland, Wilmington, Castle Hayne and Carolina Beach).

Warning: Spoilers
 
Silver Bullet is directed by Daniel Attias and adapted for the screen by Stephen King from his own novelette ""Cycle Of The Werewolf"". It stars Gary Busey, Corey Haim, Megan Follows, Everett McGill & Terry O'Quinn. The film is set in the small rural town of Tarker's Mills, Maine, which falls prey to a series of grizzly murders. At first the killings are believed to be the work of a mad man, with the town ready to take up vigilante arms against the perpetrator, but young wheelchair bound Marty (Haim) is convinced something more lupine like is responsible.

As most folks know, Stephen King's adaptations to screen are a mixed bunch. Some have been tackled by top line directors such as Kubrick, De Palma, Cronenberg, Reiner & Darabont, while others have been turned out by no marks where the quality befits the low production value. Silver Bullet falls somewhere in the middle on the quality list of King adapted movies. Its reputation is somewhat Luke warm, and whilst it's a little understandable when put up against other 1980's film's in the werewolf pantheon (An American Werewolf In London, The Howling & The Company Of Wolves), it does have a high entertainment value. Of note, too, is that it's not shy in the dark department either. There's mutilated children, a pregnant woman tore to shreds, car attack on our crippled hero, while some of the characterisations are also interesting - such as an alcoholic uncle (a wonderfully OTT Busey) & the mean hick bar dwellers who raise the spectre of vigilantism.

True, the film is also dotted with cheese, but there's fun in that too. I don't know if some of the laughs were intentional or not, but I like to think so. How else can you react to a werewolf that takes up a baseball bat to fell one of his attackers? That's surely meant to be funny, no? It is also not taxing of the brain to work out who the hairy beast is in human form, because, like, the makers gives us the clues. I really don't think they were trying to spring a big surprise on us. Cast wise it's the usual array of mixed performers. Haim is likable, particularly in the scenes with the afore mentioned Busey, O'Quinn adds professionalism, while McGill is always value for money when playing important members of the community. Tis fun too seeing future ""Reservoir Dog"" leader Lawrence Tierney putting his gruff stamp over the bar room proceedings.

So not one for the technical and artistry seeking purists then, but definitely one for those looking for a good bit of werewolf tear em' up that comes with a tasty slice of 1980s cheese. 7/10",2019-10-04T09:19:22.665Z,7.0,Silver Bullet,1985

Obviously, the immediate point of gravity for this film is Ridley Scotts 1979 film ""Alien"". Let me start by saying the resemblance is only superifcal. This is very much its own film. Unlike ""Alien"" that ramps up the pace as the terror increases, The Sputnik is a slow burn sci fi. Yes, its an alien monster mash up but utlimately its as much psychological, as it is literal.

Does it work? Well, sort of. There's some moments of genuine tension and terror, as well as a sickening sense of what people are capable of doing, to each other. Who's the real monster is a question that sticks its ugly head up.

Action is on offer too but its very brief and over almost before it begins. Whats left is interesting but does not serve up enough ""bite"" on the action or psychological terror front, to really amount to more than a entree, when a main is called for.

A super slice of sub-urban horror crafted by Ben Wheatley, Kill List blends a number of classic British films but still remains very much its own beast. And what a beast it is. Part hit-man thriller and part Wicker Man pagan horror, plot spins hit-man for hire Jay (Neil Maskell) out of his troubled domestic funk, into a world of pain and misery. Taking on a job, he, along with his partner Gal (Michael Smiley), is given a list of names for them to track and terminate. The people and the places they confront are the darkest kind, which brings out Jay's black heart as well. All this while lurking around the edges of the frame is something mysterious, something that will bring Jay to his destiny.

There is a rawness to Kill List that strikes hard, a sort of real life documentary feel that marries up with the black material to chill the bones. It's proud of its grimness, even what humour exists within just feels like damaged goods. The sound and camera work gleefully add to the unsettling atmosphere, tactics which help alleviate the feeling that we are once again watching a formulaic British thriller with ideas above its station. But then the curve ball arrives and hits you on the head, bringing dizzy spells and some delirium. Which builds to a finale that will either leave you breathless or angry, but either way Kill List will not be ignored.

Before I started my review, I decided to take a quick look at the Letterboxd reviews. I always play a minigame in my head by attempting to guess the average rating, for example for the last film I watched - <em>'Jack the Giant Slayer'</em> - I called it spot on at 2.4. This I genuinely predicted less than 2.0... it's at 3.5! To tell you I was flabbergasted would be an understatement.

There have been films in the past when my thoughts are the opposite (both positively and negatively) to the majority elsewhere, but I think this one takes the crown as the most polarizing so far. I just didn't like this 2011 release at all, there's one good piece of violence involving a hammer and a head (not like that, ichthyologists) but otherwise I found it all super underwhelming.

I hadn't heard of <em>'Kill List'</em> prior to watching it, I only decided to do so as I noticed it had Neil Maskell in it and I loved his performance a decade ago in television's <em>'Utopia'</em> - which is of similar ilk to this actually, just as violent but miles, miles greater. Those behind/alongside Maskell didn't get my approval either, with only the aforementioned violence keeping my attention.

I could sense a promising concept in there (which I guess many others actually did see, evidently), though this honestly didn't do anything for me all the way through. I sit here flummoxed reading other reviews, even the Wikipedia 'reception' section is all-out gushing about it too. Did Prime Video play me the wrong movie?!

Just noticed that this has the same director as 2016's <em>'Free Fire'</em> (which I rated 6/10), which is a good example of what I mentioned earlier in regards to my thoughts sometimes being a noticeable difference to the majority (fairly uncommon, fwiw).

2637,Wuchak,"***Haunting Mystery with Supernatural Elements – Reverent, Beautiful, Brilliant***

RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Mark Pellington, ""The Mothman Prophecies"" details some of the strange events that occurred in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, from November 15, 1966, to December 15, 1967 (13 months). The movie, however, transplants the events to the year 2001.

PLOT: Richard Gere plays John Klein, a journalist for The Washington Post trying to come to grips with the sudden death of his wife, Mary (Debra Messing). He mysteriously shows up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, where he develops a relationship with the sympathetic police sergeant, Connie (Laura Linney). Many of the town's residents have sighted an eerie mothman-like entity, similar to the one Mary saw before she died. A researcher (Alan Bates) believes that the ‘mothmen’ exist on a sphere beyond human comprehension and that they can foresee impending calamities. Is the ‘mothman’ sighted in Point Pleasant warning the citizens of one? If so, what is it?

This is not a monster movie or a slasher horror flick; if you want that see “Mothman” (2010), which is actually pretty good for a TV creature feature (and interestingly links the mothman to the unjust slaying of Cornstalk, aka Hokoleskwa, in 1777). “The Mothman Prophecies,” by contrast, is a supernatural/mystery story with cogent creepy mood. Every element skillfully works: acting, story, editing, score, cinematography, locations, effects, etc. Underneath the film’s eeriness there’s an undeniable reverent, beautiful quality while the ending is strangely touching.

One critic claimed that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and, indeed, CANNOT be figured out. But this is untrue. The film is intricate and respects the intelligence of the viewer. Questions are raised with varying possibilities. The answers are there, but you may have to watch it a few times to discover them. I appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer, even allowing room for complete misinterpretation. If the viewer wants answers s/he must have ""ears to hear"" and be willing to work for them.

My initial interpretation was that the ‘mothmen’ are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humanity by predicting great calamities but can be misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans. In a nutshell, my interpretation was that the mothman somehow brought Klein to Point Pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife, who died due to a pre-existing condition that only the mothman knew about. This explanation obviously suggests that the mothmen are good in nature.

I've come to see that this interpretation is false; a brilliantly implemented red herring.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a rare film that’s genuinely intriguing and filled with gems to mine, even if you’ve already seen it several times. It’s so artistic that it’s a pleasure to behold over and over.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 59 minutes and was shot in Kittanning, Pennsylvania (substituting for Point Pleasant), Pittsburgh (the factory and city scenes, etc.) and other Western PA towns. WRITERS: Richard Hatem wrote the screenplay from John Keel’s book.

GRADE: A

INSIGHTS ABOUT THE MOTHMEN *** SPOILER ALERT *** (Don’t read until you view the movie).

The ‘mothmen’ are evil spirits or fallen angels (they're synonymous). This is clear when viewing eye-witness drawings of the creatures, which never show beautiful angel-like beings, but rather dark disturbing, obviously-malevolent winged-creatures. It’s the same thing with the actual appearances of the creature (freeze frame the images).

A mothman CAUSED the auto accident that injured Debra Messing. Would a GOOD angelic being cause such a tragedy (regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a pre-existing problem)?

The bible calls Satan the ""prince of the power of the air;"" hence, his filthy underlings (demons) are spiritual and electro-magnetic in nature. They can thus speak through a phone that's not plugged in or perhaps manipulate a traffic light. They can mimic the voices of dead loved ones or even take human form, like Indrid Cold, Mary or the male nurse who insists that Mary's drawings are of ""angels"" and then mysteriously vanishes.

The researcher from Chicago reveals that the mothmen are from “hell” (the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth) and send out mixed messages to ruin people’s lives. They may seem to be benevolently warning humans but, at the same time, are obvious instigators of human suffering (the car crash, Gordon's job loss, insanity & ultimate demise and the researcher's loss of his family, career & respectable social life). Also, they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions. They are highly skilled masqueraders.

The reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for millennia and therefore see things 2-3 moves ahead of humans; they use this vantage point to manipulate, deceive and destroy. Since their M.O. is to “kill, steal and destroy,” they feed on death, destruction and torment and therefore venture to the places where great tragedies will transpire, like the Silver Bridge collapse.

The saved police woman at the end was number ""37,” historically a numerical symbol of The Christ, which shows that her submersion in the river and figurative resurrection is a type of the Anointed One. Yet she is still a victim in that her previous views that the mothmen are destructive and manipulative could now flip-flop into the deception that they are somehow agents of good. Of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with Klein and Connie in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive.

The film powerfully illustrates that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are malevolent beings who purpose to ruin or destroy us. Failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal or lead to great suffering. The only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with the Creator through Jesus Christ's blood shield of atonement and utilizing the armor of light.",2018-06-19T20:20:02.018Z,9.0,The Mothman Prophecies,2002

Session 9 is directed by Brad Anderson who also co-writes the screenplay with Stephen Gevedon. It stars Peter Mullan, David Caruso, Josh Lucas, Brendan Sexton III and Stephen Gevedon. Music is scored by Climax Golden Twins and cinematography is by Uta Briesewitz.

Danvers State Hospital (AKA: State Lunatic Hospital at Danvers, The Danvers Lunatic Asylum, and The Danvers State Insane Asylum), Massachusetts. Built in 1874, opened in 1878 and closed in 1992. The home to misery, madness, tragedies and troubling treatments. Five men from an asbestos removal company, each with issues or points to prove, enter the vast bat shaped structure under the promise of a big pay off to get the job done in one week. But over the course of the week money will be the last thing on their minds.

Psychological horror at its finest, Session 9, in the hands of Brad Anderson, pretty much gets everything right in this most skin itching of sub-genres. Like the ghost story splinter of horror, setting is absolutely everything, and few, if any? Horror settings are as imposing or eerie as the one time Danvers State Hospital. Sadly demolished in 2006/7 to make way for an apartment complex (bastard property developers have no respect outside of the purse), the place positively oozes unease throughout the movie. With Anderson choosing to shoot his film on videotape, this further aids the sense of realism and palpable dread, and although it isn't a stretch of the mind to think about some of the misery that played out in reality at Danvers, Anderson and his photographer Briesewitz ensure that it never leaves our conscious. Tone is set from the off as being slow burn, this is perfect as it allows us to get a grasp of the characters, their psychological make ups and narrative worth.

With the Danvers facility proving to be the extra character, all things come together seamlessly to gnaw away at the viewers. It's a devilishly odd thing to say, but as the story and characters are given room to breath, the audience who have immersed themselves in the picture will start to feel claustrophobic, and then for the night time sequences, even achluophobic. It's pitch perfect pacing by Anderson, who prior to unleashing the unnerving finale, has pulled us (and his excellent cast) slowly through a labyrinth of dank corridors, wards, treatment rooms, caged stairwells and a morgue. Even on the outside during daylight hours everything feels bleak, either with characters loomed over by the building, or on a roof chatting while Gothic turrets watch over them menacingly, the ghosts and bitterness of Danvers Hospital exist fully in Anderson's movie.

Story links a tape recording found by Mike (Gevedon) with that of the workers' unfolding plight. The tape tells of 9 sessions with a troubled patient named Mary Hobbes, to say anymore would be spoilerish, but for the record in this writers eyes it's the creepiest tape recording in horrorville. Add in the odd hospital prop such as a lone wheelchair, a hydrotherapy bath or an orbitoclast! Well you get the picture I'm sure. Climax Golden Twins provide a suitably jarring score, where disjointed noises and elongated tonal strains further enhance the pervading disquiet. Picture only falls down slightly with silly plot error involving a furnace, and for some folk the ending will inevitably be met with dissatisfaction. I liked it plenty but I also feel they could have gone another way with it. But it does work well and isn't a cop out, and certainly it's better than the alternate ending available in the extras section of home disc formats.

It's a horror film aimed at a certain horror fan, the one who has the patience to enjoy slow burn psychological pin prickery. All played out expertly by cast and film makers at a naturally unsettling location. 9/10",2019-10-18T02:19:55.361Z,10.0,Session 9,2001
467660,John Chard,"Divisive Dilemas.

Have to be honest, I had no idea this was filmed on an iPhone 7 or that it was directed by Steven Soderbergh. I was stuck for something to watch on cable the other night and I liked the sound of the plot premise. So unburdened by expectation of a searing horror classic I settled in to see what unfolds.

Plot has Claire Foy as Sawyer Valentini who inadvertently commits herself to a mental health institution. Once inside things being to unravel and the threat of her one time stalker now being even close to her opens up the book of terror - but is it real?

Firstly you have to say that the mental health authorities must have had kittens when they saw this, much of what is on screen is utterly ridiculous and paints the system in a damning light. Secondly you really have to jump on board with the improbability of it all, this really is made for dramatic entertainment purpose and not as a viable horror of the real world.

As a thriller it worked for me, the constant question of what is real or not keeps things on the slow burn. Either way, real or not, it's thought provoking enough to warrant staying till pics end. The psychological angle is pungent enough to say there's some thought in the writing, though this is undone by utter nonsense as things spiral into the impossible for the final quarter of film.

Foy is good value up front and the fulcrum of it all, while elsewhere good work comes from Nate Hoffman and it's nice to see Juno Temple in a spicy role. Ultimately this is no blood letting horror picture, and certainly it's no One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Girl Interrupted etc etc. 

The iPhone experiment is a gimmick that works here due to the confines of the location for story, but as a genre piece of worth it is unlikely to have legs. However, even though I enjoyed this as a one time only viewing experience, I perfectly understand why it has become divisive. So for those who haven't seen it yet then it is advised you understand this is no terrifying thrill a minute piece. It's tricky to recommend with any sort of confidence, and thus I feel the internet ratings of about 6.5/10 is just about right. 6.5/10",2019-03-27T12:28:56.414Z,6.0,Unsane,2018

It's decent enough to (in most scenes) get the visuals across, but never decent enough to not be a distraction. _Unsane's_ tale is relatively well told, but also something that's been done before, and considering the man in the director's chair, something that probably should have been done better too.

11980,GenerationofSwine,"Wow, well, you really know a Widen movie when you see one. He's one of those writers that come up with something unique each time he brings a script to the screen...he's also one of those writers that you just have to assume is on powerful hallucinogenic drugs.

Walken, of course, gets top billing, and he did do a very good job, who doesn't love it when he's a villein? He is always delightfully creepy and, in The Prophecy he balances that creepiness with a healthy does of humor. It makes him a lovable character, but then he does have a great sense of humor and one of the best deadpan deliveries in modern Hollywood.

Still...Elias Koteas. I don't think he means to do it, but he always takes center stage in whatever he does and The Prophecy is no different. The man just brings his A-game to every movie, every bit part he has ever played. And like his turn in Fallen, the one thing that lingers in your memory when the movie is over, is the Koteas performance. As usual he wields raw acting power with ease.

Stolz, as always, plays Eric Stoltz, but in this movie it works perfectly. He is the angel just following orders, and one that positively stinks of 90s era cool. You know from the first time you see him on screen that he was the perfect casting choice for Simon.

What makes it better is Adam Goldberg, the man that is always cast in the same sort of roles. That is the slightly dorky Jew. He's really the same character he was in Saving Private Ryan, only far more pathetic. But he also provides the comic relief as a walking, decaying, reanimated corpse forced back to life to be Walken's unwilling and lippy servant. The movie needed elements of relief to keep it grounded enough to appeal to the none Biblically inclined and Goldberg, well, he does his job and makes you laugh.

What you have here is a small film with a small budget and a great cast and it works. It works better than anyone can imagine, partially because the surreal quality of the script needed a small budget to keep it believable, and partially because the production quality forced everyone to relay on a very well written story and weigh it all on a cast that could turn it into something memorable.

Eastern Europe wilderness and the sales division of weapons company Palisade Defence are meant to be having a team building weekend. But once they reach their less than luxurious lodge out in the forest, it becomes apparent they are not alone...

We open with a chase that results in a brutal murder, all played out to the wonderful strains of The Small Faces singing ""Itchycoo park,"" it's obvious from this moment that this is no ordinary horror comedy. Comedy as everyone knows is hugely subjective, even more so when it involves horror, some attempts have been roundly accepted such as parody supreme Shaun Of The Dead or nervous titillation in the Evil Dead series, while others are so bad they don't need a mention here. Severance, happily, is as sharp with its humour as one of the knives used in the piece itself, perfectly tuned into the modern world and the bizarreness of it all.

What started out as a working script called ""P45"", where Christopher Smith's film was to be about these ""yuppie"" types literally team building for a weekend where if they didn't pass the tests they lost their jobs, escalated to a slasher with a wry satirical edge. The characters, as the makers point out on the DVD, are the perfect blend of the archetypal office workers. Each of them can readily be found in any Brirtish office on any given day. The ineffective leader who's wormed his way into the position, the jocular wide boy, the creep, the babe attracting all the sexual attention and on it goes. Each character rich with British office traditions thrust together for one bubbling comedy stew.

Enter the central theme of weapons making companies firmly under the microscope and Severance has much to say. As a promo video made by the managing director plays, the irony is absolutely hilarious and sets the film up a treat. Even as the film gets bloody, and it's certainly bloody at times, the smiling assassin nature of the script continues to be bitingly funny. There's reams of clever jokes in the piece, so many in fact that even now after my third viewing experience I'm still finding new stuff. So with that I would urge anyone who has only seen it the one time, and been less than enamoured with the premise, to try again and observe and listen without interruption. 

There's even self mocking of the genre it belongs in, and this from the director of 2004s culter, Creep. The cast are uniformly strong, from Tim McInnerny's weasel team leader portrayal to Danny Dyer's with type drug taking ""cockernee"" boy, all playing off each other with smart and mirth inducing results.

I'm just not buying into the bad rating for this film, in 1996 Wes Craven's Scream reinvigorated an ailing genre and got fans back into the horror groove. The love for that film, I feel, tends to skew opinions of the second instalment in what became the Scream foursome, Scream 2 seams perfectly from its starting point to up the daring ante, and plonk tongue even further into its cheek in the process.

Sidney Prescott has moved on from the horrendous murders in Woodsboro and is at college getting on with her life, but the peace and hope for a bright future is quickly shattered because the Scream killer is back for more carnage...

The film's opening perfectly sets out the tone for the entire picture, we see a cinema full of fake knife wielding youths dressed as the Scream killer, the film they are watching is Stab, the story of the Woodsboro murders. It's a wry commentary moment from Wes Craven, but in truth it's just one of many he makes in the film, the in jokes about sequels never gets tired, and the boo jump scare moments are all there to enjoy. Red Herrings come and go, and all the great characters who survived the first film are back again. Dewey & Gale get fleshed out a bit more, and one time caged innocent (and chief suspect) Cotton Weary is now a major character just begging us to find out if he's hero or villain.

This is a sharply scripted piece of work, it knows its aims and delivers what it sets out to do, it benefits from a brilliant sound mix to emphasise the mayhem, and Craven is something of a master in racking up the tension. To laugh and be scared is the order of the day, so sit back and enjoy a film that to me proves that not all sequels suck. Oh the ending does not disappoint at all either I have to say.

Can she and reporter ""Gale Wethers"" (Courteney Cox) stay alive long enough to find out just who - or whom - is behind these ghastly crimes?

Wes Craven has a magic touch when it comes to gory action-horror films, but here he left it on the bathroom floor.

4233,Nathan,"**_Scream 2_ starts off strong with a fantastic first act, but slowly stumbles into mediocrity with a lackluster finale.**

The beginning of this film was exhilarating, it was so messed up seeing how infatuated people were with this real-life killer and their seeming lack of awareness that a woman was being brutally murdered in their presence. They crank up the gore from the original, leading me to believe that we were going to be in for a treat, but I was wrong. The first act was really strong, and I enjoyed the college campus setting with some exhilarating scenes in the sorority houses. But towards the end of the second act, the film starts to drag on, with too much down time spent on character development and lackluster chase scenes. I think the main killer’s motivation is pretty weak. They try to pull off a _Friday the 13th_-type reveal with Billy Loomis’s mom, but it just doesn't land. She abandoned her child before the first film, and all of a sudden, after he becomes a killer, she wants to get revenge on the victim? It just does not make sense. I did enjoy Mickey, as he was the only interesting new addition to the film. This story had a lot of potential, but I can't help but feel it was slightly wasted.

Our performances were mixed this time around. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox were fantastic; they are the true stars of the franchise, and their characters have such a nice arc here that I really appreciated, especially Cox. Jamie Kennedy was also great as the only character who truly realizes what is going on in this horror film, his commentary going forward will be missed. David Arquette was again pretty weak; I do think it mainly had to do with poor writing, as the crimpling walk he had to perform felt weird and in poor taste. Jerry O’Connell was corny and forgettable. Liev Schreiber’s character stinks. Timothy Olyphant was the only new addition that I genuinely enjoyed.

The direction from Wes Craven was still great overall, with some fantastic scenes, particularly in the sorority house, that I thoroughly enjoyed. This may be personal taste, but I still think this franchise can push the horror and gore more. I feel they are giving us a tease in every film of what they are truly capable of.

Overall, _Scream 2_ left a lot on the table for what could have been a really great sequel. It is still somewhat enjoyable, but it is hard to deny the massive step back it took from the original.

Will any of them make it out alive? 

This is basically a meshing of “The Blair Witch Project” (1999) and “Ogre” (2008), but without the tongue-in-cheekiness of the latter. There’s also a little bit of “The Wicker Man” (1973/2006). Like “Blair Witch” the foul-mouthed protagonists become increasingly horrified in the foreboding forest and eventually turn on one another. But the sylvan cinematography is leagues superior due to the spectacular Romanian locations as opposed to the pedestrian film-work of “Blair Witch” in Maryland (which is understandable since the latter is a “found-footage” flick).

I’m not going to give-away the creature, which isn’t fully revealed until the last fifteen minutes, but it’s basically a hybrid of the monsters in “The Relic” (1997) and “Wendigo” (2001), albeit bigger, and superior to both. The second half deviates from the book and people complain about it, but it’s superior to the lame black metal cult of the book IMHO and you can’t beat one potent sequence that smacks of hell-on-earth. There’s also an intriguing element about achieving nigh-immortality at the price of submissive veneration. Despite these positives, the movie’s a little uneventful and humdrum, plus it's lacking in the female department.                

The movie runs 1 hour 34 minutes and was shot entirely in Romania. WRITERS: Joe Barton wrote the script based on Adam Nevill’s 2012 novel. CAST: The four protagonists are played by Rafe Spall, Arsher Ali, Robert James-Collier and Sam Troughton.

433808,RalphRahal,"David Bruckner's The Ritual is an atmospheric horror film that effectively combines psychological tension with a touch of the supernatural. The story follows four friends on a hiking trip in the Scandinavian wilderness, where they encounter not only the haunting landscape but also their own fears and regrets.

What sets The Ritual apart is the authenticity of the characters and their relationships. The dialogue and interactions feel natural, and the bond between the friends comes across as genuine, with years of shared history subtly woven into their exchanges. This grounding in realism makes the escalating terror all the more impactful.

The film takes its time building suspense, though some scenes linger longer than necessary, and certain dialogues feel repetitive. These moments, while noticeable, don’t detract significantly from the overall experience. The latter part of the movie veers into unexpected territory, delivering an unsettling and imaginative climax that feels fresh in a genre often bound by convention.

Visually, the film is stunning, with the eerie forest serving as a character in its own right, amplifying the isolation and dread. The Ritual succeeds in blending human drama with horror, creating a story that's both haunting and deeply relatable.

I've always questioned myself why The Conjuring Universe possesses more spin-offs than main titles since The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 are, by far, the best films of the popular horror franchise. Looking at the numbers, The Nun holds the box office record, being the most successful movie of the saga financially, but ironically enough, it's also the most disliked film by both critics and audience members. The viral marketing campaign obviously hyped this spin-off to an unbelievable level of expectation, but it's still strange that it took five years to deliver another The Conjuring flick since both previous installments were tremendously profitable as well.

With James Wan out of the director's chair and without a screenplay credit, my expectations weren't exactly high. Wan is one of the main reasons why The Conjuring movies work so well. From his ability to generate an enormous amount of suspense to the actually scary atmosphere, Wan is definitely one of the best horror directors of the last decade. Therefore, replacing him would always be a challenging task. Michael Chaves directed The Curse of La Llorona, a generic, bland horror flick that didn't have a single surprising element. However, I did compliment Chaves' work with the horror sequences since I did find them somewhat effective. So, I was still feeling optimistic about The Devil Made Me Do It...

It's admittedly the weakest film of the trilogy, but it's still far from the awful Annabelle Comes Home or the hideous origin story about the famous nun. When it comes to the main titles, the exceptional production value is something all have in common. In fact, this latest flick is arguably the best-looking one. The horror sequences look stunning on the big screen, and the sound design is extremely impactful as always. It's worth remembering that this franchise doesn't waste hundreds of millions to make its movies, being a relatively low-budget cinematic universe, especially when compared to every other studio's massive sagas. Practical effects are always the go-to if possible, keeping the use of CGI to the minimum.

Acting-wise, it's also where these films triumph. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga share palpable chemistry, deeply elevating their characters' emotional connection. At its core, The Conjuring features a love story between Ed and Lorraine Warren, ultimately being their grounded, convincing, loving relationship that keeps the viewers interested in the least ""based on a true story"" events. Both actors deliver remarkable performances, as does the legendary John Noble (The Lord of the Rings, Fringe) as a former priest. I didn't know about his casting before the movie, so I was genuinely surprised by seeing Noble on the big screen again. He's absolutely phenomenal, as expected, and quite creepy as a mysterious character.

Everyone else is decent enough, but I don't find any other interpretation worth noting. Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go compliment-wise. The primary narrative surrounding the actual case that gives the name to the film is nowhere near as interesting as the stories told in the previous The Conjuring movies. The case itself doesn't have much to tell, so the majority of the film rests on following the beloved couple going on side quests as detectives. Eventually, the clues found are connected to the main plot, but overall, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay isn't that captivating. Despite the predictability and formulaic horror elements, there's a rather enjoyable ""twist"" to the whole ""demon possession"" routine that marks the entire franchise.

The biggest disappointment is something I feared would happen without James Wan at the helm. The once terrifying, suspenseful atmosphere during the effective, creative jumpscare sequences now gives place to the generic build-up that viewers experience in some of the cheapest horror movies of today. Due to a character's health issue, the tension levels are constantly high for this person in particular, but for most of the runtime, the general environment lacks the essential scary feeling. The jumpscares look lazy and too obvious, a cliche that The Conjuring films fought hard to distance themselves from. In addition to this, it's a much darker movie than the rest in terms of lighting.

Finally, I have mixed feelings about the ending. Without spoiling it, of course, it's similar to A Quiet Place Part II in the sense that two different sequences need to be edited together seamlessly so the viewers can easily follow what's happening without losing the tension and suspense. One of these scenes is particularly shaky, repetitive, and overly dark, which definitely left me a bit disappointed. Peter Gvozdas and Christian Wagner's editing is really good, though. Michael Burgess' cinematography offers a couple of gorgeous shots, and Joseph Bishara's score maintains the ominous tone of the franchise. James Wan is clearly missed, but Michael Chaves didn't do a bad job.

The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is undoubtedly the weakest installment of the trilogy, but it's still quite far from the awful level of the worst films of the horror franchise. Boasting the trademark terrific production value of the saga, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga deliver outstanding lead performances as the only two emotionally compelling characters. Overall, every element is lesser than the previous The Conjuring movies. From the less scary atmosphere to the unimaginative, generic jumpscares, Michael Chaves isn't able to replicate James Wan's tremendous levels of suspense and tension, despite a brilliant opening sequence. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's screenplay focuses on many storylines indirectly connected to the main plot, ending up with a not-that-interesting narrative that doesn't quite justify the main title. Some technical attributes, mainly the editing and cinematography, as well as sound design, compensate with some entertainment. In the end, I still recommend it to fans of the cinematic universe and lovers of the horror genre.

423108,Giovanni,"Full Analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/ - **Intro** - Released in June 2021, “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” is an American-British production that lasts for one hour and fifty-two minutes. It belongs to the genres of religion, crime, horror and drama, and it’s part of the “Conjuring Universe.” The trial of Arne Johnson inspired the movie. The film is not precisely the reproduction of what happened. But we need to remember that it’s a movie, and fiction is mandatory for our entertainment. And the film is engaging. It provides moments of pure adrenaline and pieces of beautiful cinematography and photography. Although it is not perfect, we think it deserves your time because God, daemons and exorcisms, apparently, are with us, believe it or not. Let us explain it to you. - **The Story** - In July 1981, Ed and Lorraine Warren, a couple who specialised in paranormal investigations, were helping the Glatzel. Their eight-year son David was experiencing unexplained and disturbing symptoms, which were consuming David and the whole family. So the Warren decides that it’s time for a real exorcism, and they go to document it.
But something terrible and unexpected is going to happen, and also the Warren get surprised. In fact, the event degenerates into an escalation of violence, murder, and occult rituals. The case became a worldwide event because, for the first time in history, the defence lawyer brought in front of the court the fact that a demon possessed the killer. Will the lawyer succeed with her defence? What is that Ed and Lorraine are going to prove?And what is your opinion about this surreal but true story? - **Full Analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/the-conjuring-the-devil-made-me-do-it-2021-movie-review-and-analysis/**",2021-11-08T21:40:43.645Z,7.0,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It,2021
273477,Frank Ochieng,"We certainly get the inside joke about wanting to skewer something as raucous and ridiculous as lambasting nonsensical and numbing grade B horror flicks that are worthy of such scrutiny. After all, the temptation is just too much to resist in not exposing such throwaway thrills of intentional insipidness, correct? Plus, incorporating a mixture of smarmy filth and frolic involving menacing zombies, hormonal teens, bouncy bimbos and any other fright-driven clichés that one can think immediately off-the-cuff should be enough to satisfy the creepy concoction of craziness, right? Well wrong...especially when the experimental goosebump gags fall flat and feel synthetically repetitive in the over-indulgent and inane fear farce Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse. 

Sure, some will automatically gravitate to the outlandish Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse and invite the spirit of the movie's manufactured foolishness as an elaborate playful put-on. In many ways, co-writer/director Christopher Landon wants to promote the silly-coated salaciousness of his teasing teen-oriented terror tale with a sly wink and anticipates that the audience will embrace Zombie Apocalypse as an unconventional, naughty-minded tangy treat for giddy thrill-seekers. Sure, Landon's off-kilter humor horror show is meant as an escapist ruse and wears its badge of honor as a brain-dead flesh-and-blood fright fable garnering cheap chuckles. Nevertheless, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse feels relentlessly lazy, mean-spirited and connects as a raunchy wasteland of sluggish juvenile jolts and jabs.


There is no excuse for Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse to present such a witless,  misplaced macabre mess. In an age where spoofing zombie flicks in cinema can be high-minded and heralded in both creepiness and creativity in the shadows of such riotous offerings as Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland, it is inexplicable how something like the rancid and toothless Zombie Apocalypse can be so arbitrarily clueless and contemptible in its strained search for crafting off-balance laughs. Again, it is realized that zombie cinema--however serious or silly-minded--is not exactly on the food chain of being considered a viable selection for the American Film Institute anytime soon. Still, there should at least have been some sense of smartness and perception injected in the aimless zaniness that Zombie Apocalypse emits routinely in its languished lunacy. Instead, Landon and his fellow screenwriters invite a series of empty-minded shock value shrills to the proceedings and hopes that the viewers will embrace the cluttered chaos without question. Sadly, some will do just that (read: the indiscriminate teen demo in general) as they will go with the flow and bask in the baseless swamp of tasteless titillation. Consequently, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is about as adventurous, amusing and intriguing as a medieval stoning in a rural town square.



Undoubtedly, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse needs the approval of its boys locker room impishness to feature such graphic and goofy-minded displays of sexual body part piercings to pad the already morose stupidity put forth in desperate vain. If your idea of horror-minded high jinks include the subjection of zombie-related severed penises and constant groping of female breasts then guess what...Zombie Apocalypse will certainly satisfy one's hormonal guilty pleasures in a heartbeat. In addition, it pays to also have some stunt casting and add to the dumb cheekiness where the likes of the once celebrated Oscar and Emmy-winning veteran actress Cloris Leachman serves as the token oldster to certify the gimmicky warped proceedings (perhaps Leachman's former Mary Tyler Moore Show co--star in the beloved pop cultural and iconic Betty White was not available to sign on the dotted line for this teen terror train-wreck?).

The premise, while highlighting the gore and boyhood gratification of wet dreams, involves a group of youngsters that belong to a scouting organization while being taught the efficiency of  leadership and self-reliance. Naturally, these boys will put their merit badges to the test as they must combat the overflowing presence of threatening zombies that are infiltrating their small community. Not only must these adolescents learn to battle each other competitively and tackle their own nagging growing pains but know they must band together and slaughter the walking dead menaces that look to make some serious ominous waves within their bedroom town.

The teenage terminators that are called into action are Ben, Carter and Augie (played by Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller and Joey Morgan). Of course this trio fits into the distinctive archetype of youth labeling. Ben is the clean cut kid with some semblance of sensibility. Carter is a handful as the insufferable horndog. Lastly, Augie is the geeky hanger-on. So there you have it--the mini-sized Three Musketeers out to destroy some zombie butt and take down numbers in the process. 

The feminine eye candy wrapped up in this monstrous madness includes Carter's sister Kendall (Halston Sage). Kendall also serves as the convenient object of affection for the love-struck Ben. And what would a horror flick be without the resident curvaceous gun-toting, butt-kicking beauty with the killer instinct of zombie zapping?  In this case, that role would go to strip club siren Denise (Sarah Dumont) whose skill in eradicating the zombie pests as she struts around like an armed jiggly cheerleader in heat becomes increasingly distracting (or maybe not for some that might find this bombastic and busty Barbie Doll lustfully ""liberating""). 

The boys' scout leader (former Saturday Night Live alum David Koechner) is the accident-prone wonder whose penchant for overcoming various injuries is supposedly laughable yet the joke of his clumsy confrontations quickly tires out and grows old. However, the scout leader is essential to the storyline for the tykes because he suffers the fate of becoming one of the zombies that needs to be destroyed. It certainly does not help matters any when poor Kendall's safety is jeopardized and the boys (especially Ben in particular) along with Denise's assisted brashness must rescue Carter's pretty sibling and protect the town's masses from the zombie intruders.

For the most part, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is a woefully tepid tease that does not care much about its sloppy execution. The scattershot script constructed by Landon and fellow scribers Carrie Evans, Emi Mochizuki and Lona Williams vacillates back and forth in complete cartoonish chaos and it is never clear as to why any of us would want to put stock in hoping that the periled protagonists of this banal roguish romp emerge victorious? The combination of humor, sentimental vibes and sketchy scare tactics overlap and is perceived as annoyingly inconsistent. The deplorable and disposable foundation for the sexual depiction of the females in Zombie Apocalypse is insulting and does not invite any sense of truth or revelation besides flashing feminine skin for the sake of giving this horror hiccup some trivial sauciness. The hoards of zombies being butchered in some imaginative selective scenes is at first kind of challenging in an offbeat, exaggerated sort of sinister way. The repetitive slaughtering gradually becomes off-putting and you are left wondering rather or not you were better off chopping off your own limbs for enduring this boisterous bomb in the first place. 

Hopelessly choppy and chintzy, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse could have been stunningly irreverent and still carried out its nuttiness with a coherent slice of clever mockery attached to its brand of mayhem. The zombies genre seems all the rage now within today's pop cultural climate. Of course with the continued disconnected gory gumption of damaged duds such as Apocalypse the future invitation of visiting the zombie zone in entertainment may become as extinct as the dinosaur.

At first I believed it was a children's horror movie, I have not even known it was rated R. In the opening scene itself convinced me that it's going to be aggressive as the progression commence. Yeah, it lived up to my last minute expectation. A fine time pass movie for the regular audience, definitely it won't suits for the critics' viewing.

When the three friends find virus outbreak in their town that turns everyone into zombies, they plan to make into a safe place along saving a few others in their attempt. Surely this is what every zombie movie you have seen dealt with. The same old adventure in zombie theme, but the characters and the scenarios were different with lots of fun. I was surprised at that part, surely a cult status will be tagged for it.

Overall movie was decent, but being a horror-comedy was its strength. Just leave the logics behind and enjoy the entertainment it offers. In the end you will be convinced for your patience. It is the movie you might like it, but can't give full marks. One of the many reasons was, it is not a mainstream actor or the filmmaker's film. But still the entire team was awesome, and delivered its purpose. It was not a box office hit, but still I expect there will be a sequel.

273477,mattwilde123,"I thought this film would be a cross between 'Superbad' and 'Zombieland'. I think I was too accurate. There is nothing original about this film. I suppose originality is not what you are looking for when sitting down to this film which is fair enough but every single character has been ripped from the pages of previous 'teen' movie scripts that have gone before it and the humour doesn't even make it stand out.

The story does move on slightly from the tiresome quest of American teenagers wanting to get laid when the zombies appear (spoiler alert!) which kept my interest slightly. The over-the-top gore was fun but only distracted me slightly from how poor the other aspects of the film were.

Overall, the screenplay and performances are nothing to write home about but it was quite well directed.

551804,r96sk,"Kathryn Newton deserved better.

<em>'Freaky'</em> is largely a (very) mixed bag, but Newton's performance is honestly superb - which makes it difficult to rate. On the one hand you have a fairly run-of-the-mill slasher, yet on the other Newton's showing is of such quality that it belongs in something far greater. She's top notch here, it's just severely unfortunate the film is nowhere near her level at all.

There are a few decent slasher-y moments and Vince Vaughn tries. Speaking of Vaughn, it's neat to see a different side to him as an actor but I found him to be 50/50 in this; he kills it (pardon the pun) in some parts, but in others it's clear he's trying to impersonate a teenage girl - which is the complete opposite to Newton, who plays two characters supremely well.

I know I'm repeating myself, but... in layman's terms: Newton good, film bad.",2022-05-06T00:57:41.886Z,6.0,Freaky,2020
551804,Nathan,"Freaky is a self-aware horror comedy spin on the classic film Freaky Friday (hence the name freaky). The slasher elements are extremely present, and I loved the shades of Friday the 13th with the Jason style killer and the sharp music, reminiscent of the original F13 score, playing during his scenes. The kills are incredibly brutal and really earn the R rating, some are very creative while others are the run of the mill horror kills. While watching this movie I could not help but feel bored at times. There were some definite lulls that could have been sharpened up for a tighter movie viewing experience.
I understand that the movie was self-aware and poked fun at a lot of horror tropes, bult I felt as if they went a little too overboard. There were some scenes of bullying that just felt so unbelievable and over the top that it really pulled me out of the film even though I understood it was being satirical. The acting overall was pretty good, some lines were delivered awkwardly but nothing that was too consistent to harm the experience. Vince Vaughn is fantastic in this movie, and when that switch happens, he really sells that he is a high school girl in a killer's body with his girly movements and dialect.
Overall, I had a fun time with the movie, but there were quite a few elements that really hold it back.

I'm sure you have seen shark attack films like 'Jaws', 'Deep Blue Sea' et cetera, and yep this another one to add to that collection. But this was something very neatly done, I mean for the most of the parts. Looked so real, so I thought it might end up top among its similar theme. In the end, I was little disappointed, because of the shark. The portrayal of shark was very natural, until the last half an hour. Then it becomes the common film gimmick when the animal was obsessed to kill its target at any cost.

I am a huge animal fan, but I have never seen a live shark in my life and that does not mean I don't know anything about them. Thanks to the nature television networks and what I saw in this film was very disappointing if you love wild animals. I am not supporting the shark here, I'm just talking about its behaviour. It was not right, other than that, I definitely enjoyed the film. In fact, except the final few minutes, since the shark got pumped up, I had no issue and the best shark attack film. But the final battle ruined overall favour I'm going to give to it, what I thought this film deserved.

Great location, and Blake Lively was unbelievably awesome. In the initial part, she was very sexy, but once the narration shifted its focus on surfing and later shark attack, everything changed. The entire film was edgy, I think very nicely written screenplay. It was a limited cast film and nearly the whole film takes place very close to the shore. A good start, neatly maintained mid part, but a below par conclusion, that's what I think about the film. Slightly missed to be a great film in the line of '127 Hours'. In fact, this looks like a sea version of that film. But I still recommend it, because it's worth.

_6.5/10_",2016-10-24T17:41:17.950Z,7.0,The Shallows,2016
332567,in_the_crease,"As a shark fanatic (thanks, Jaws), I was excited to see The Shallows. When I first saw the trailer, I thought the concept--more 127 Hours than Jaws--was interesting: A single person, alone on a rock, trapped a mere 100 or so yards offshore, in shark-infested waters.

Most shark movies follow the Jaws formula to a T: Shark attacks a bather, someone in position of authority decides something must be done and the beaches should be closed, someone of higher authority thwarts that attempt, more people die, our hero finally has to confront the monster. 

But The Shallows produced a new and fresh take on the same old fish tale. The first half of the movie is similar to Open Water, relying on tension and little fanfare. Then, the shark explodes onto the screen for a few moments, and the movie suddenly becomes a high octane thriller. Basically, though the shark is the main antagonist of this story, all the scenes with the shark in them are much less interesting. I was more engaged with Blake Lively and that damn seagull. She was likable, and I bought into the survival story and was really rooting for her.

There were moments, when The Shallows relied on suspense, that the film become Hitchcockian in tone. We know the shark is out there, but we can't see him. The second we do, the suspense dies instantly. Parts of the movie were small and intimate, much like an independent film. And those were the strengths.

But it almost feels as if the director wanted to do a mash up of a simple suspenseful stalking movie, combined with elements of a survival movie. And again, all that worked for me.

But the sensationalism of the shark stuff was over the top in my opinion. It gave the movie an uneven feel. It was, at times, both a suspenseful stalker type movie with survivalism thrown in, and, then, seemingly out of nowhere, it became an over-the-top summer blockbuster type movie. 

It gives it the look of a movie where director and producer didn't see eye to eye. It really seems like the shark action sequences were forced into the movie. They just didn't fit the overall tone. That's this movie's biggest downfall. Yes, the shark has to be there, yes he has to be dangerous. But the way it is presented through the film needs to fit the overall tone of the movie. At one point, the shark eats three people in the course of-- what?--an hour or so? So what was set up, was a small movie. An intimate movie. Something closer to The Blair Witch Project or Open Water, but what we got in the end, was something closer to Friday the 13th.

This movie could have been so much more, by being so much less. Excess is not always best. 

In all fairness, The Shallows could have been much worse too. The things that did work, worked well--well enough that with some inventive direction, could have carried the film by themselves. But alas, the over the top violence and sensationalism trumped suspense and creative storytelling, which downgrades The Shallows from something special and unique, to just a ""good"" movie.

332567,CinemaSerf,"There's quite a bit of menace from the photography and at least the shark looks real as it terrorises the stranded ""Nancy"" (Blake Lively) in a small inlet a matter of a few hundred yards from the shore. Naturally, she's left all of her stuff on the beach so is completely incommunicado after a passing Great White decides it wants a snack. Luckily there are a few big rocks and even a chunky metal reef marker for her to shelter on as she prays that someone will come to her aide. Someone, that is, with sense enough to wonder what she is doing stuck on a rock and not just to get into the water, blithely and finally. Though I'm not sure just how physically possible the denouement is, I did really like those few seconds and to be fair, Lively does manage to convey a decent degree of desperation as the tenacious shark gets more and more peckish, angry and innovative. Can she survive? Well on that front the jeopardy level is precisely zero and the whole film is easily half an hour too long, but there are still some squeaky moments and it's worth a watch, if only to remind us just how vulnerable and out of our depth mankind is in a nature where our technology doesn't count.",2025-01-11T13:38:19.148Z,6.0,The Shallows,2016

There are some rough patches, but overall, it's not a bad film. “Paranormal Activity” is shot in a found footage format, with believable acting and some effective scares. The film brilliantly capitalizes on the concept that what's scariest isn't often what you see, but what you imagine, and it does so effectively. However, that is about all it has going for it; it is not really terrifying, the story is as ordinary as it possibly could be, and the conclusion leaves a lot to be desired. If you have some time to kill, you probably will not regret checking it out, but I personally don't think it's worth going out of one's way to do so.",2022-10-30T15:14:20.518Z,6.0,Paranormal Activity,2007

257445,Frank Ochieng,"Well the Halloween season 2015 is upon us now and what better way than to cozy up to the youngsters at the box office than offering the innocuous tingly treat Goosebumps? The goofy-minded family-friendly frightfest does have the ingredients to muster up some interest for the little goblins out there looking for hearty rounds of boos and bumps. The question remains: does Goosebumps have the mindless macabre-related mayhem to sell its scatterbrained scary tactics to the trick-or-treat tykes looking for off-the-cuff jitters on the big screen?

Director Rob Letterman has armed the frivolous Goosebumps with aimless zaniness anchored on the nutty shoulders of the film’s leading kinetic kook Jack Black. Unfortunately, the loose presentation of combined live action and animation imagery put forth in Goosebumps seemed rather strained and misplaced. Sure, it is noted that Goosebumps reinforce a wackiness rooted in nonsensical hilarity…something considered safe and suitable for the kiddie crowd.  Nevertheless, Letterman’s breezy kiddie creepy caper–even with the free-spirited Jack Black at the helm–registers with a lameness that would have some demanding youths rolling their eyes  for something more hip and edgy.

Goosebumps is from the imaginative mind of R.L. Stine who has authored the vastly popular children book series while selling millions of copies worldwide. Stine’s aforementioned Goosebumps book collection for young adults (YA) have led to a successful Saturday morning cartoon series as well. Now Sony Pictures Entertainment wants to capitalize on the craze and tap into the youngsters’ consciousness with outlandish Pied Piper Jack Black heading up the charge in this toothless tale of juvenile high jinks.

One would think that Goosebumps could up the ante a bit with the backers involved such as screenwriter Darren Lemke (“Jack the Giant Slayer”) from a story by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Both Letterman and Black collaborated on the dud Gulliver’s Travels thus corrupting the Jonathan Swift literary masterpiece with their big screen bomb. Black, who stole the show with his mini-sized co-stars in School of Rock, would be an ideal choice to appear in another children-themed entry mired in outrageous fortune. Unfortunately, Goosebumps merely chalks up its sketchy existence in being a jumbled ball of flimsy foolishness while never really connecting solidly with a cohesive story that brings the frenzied proceedings together. Besides, what could Goosebumps the movie offer in freshness that the countless Stine books and animated program had not touched upon before in its adventurous skin? The answer: not very much.

For teenager Zach Cooper (Dylan Minnette, “Prisoners”) the transition in moving to the bedroom community of Madison, Delaware from the hustle and bustle of New York is quite a letdown. Zach’s recently widowed mother Gale (Amy Ryan) relocates for a new job offer and Zach has no choice but to accept his new less-than-stimulating surroundings. However, the one discovery that is about to make Zach a little more accepting of his new home is the pretty neighboring Hannah (Odeya Rush). The main obstacle that stands in the way of getting to know Hannah, sadly, is her over-protective father in stand-offish writer R.L. Stine (Black). The flustered Stine has some major issues with the creativity process when conceiving his characterizations.

Soon Zach would have to join forces with the Stines and nerdy best buddy Champ (Ryan Lee,”Super 8″) when he accidentally unleashes R.L.’s monstrous creations onto the small unsuspecting town (it turns out that Stine’s fictitious beastly book protagonists are in fact real menaces come to life). Can Zach and company save the day as these bothersome pests roam the unprotected streets at will? Will Zach earn extra brownie points in winning Hannah’s heart as well as her reclusive father’s approval?

It is a mixed bag reception for the scattershot Goosebumps. On one hand many of the ardent followers of Stine’s written work will recognize the inclusion of some familiar notable villainous visitors that feature The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena, Revenge of the Gnomes and Werewolf of Fever Swamp (let’s not forget Slappy the evil ventriloquist too). Plus, some would consider it a bonus in having Black’s unflappable voice-over work earmarked for some of the standby monsters wreaking havoc in random fashion. The CGI special effects register with some semblance of awestruck momentum. Still, the manic moments piggyback one another and the cheap giggles, sight gags and punchy predicaments feel needlessly forced.

Strangely, Black seems somewhat restrained as Robert Lawrence Stine. In fact, Jillian Bell’s off-the-wall Aunt Lorraine is more of an energetic comical force than the usually high-strung Black. Both Minnette’s Zach and Rush’s Hannah are somewhat serviceable as the Romeo-and-Juliet tandem but they could have played up their on-screen chemistry more charmingly than what was presented by them in inexplicable blandness. As for the supporting adult players they arbitrarily pop in and out without a chance to fully realize their contributions in this flimsy farce geared at the indiscriminate pee wees.

Perhaps the tots will get a decent rise out of the jolly emptiness that is Goosebumps. As for the rest of us we will probably get a better result in sucking on last year’s recycled stale Halloween candy.

257445,Reno,"> Not a unique concept, but the rest were completely surprised me.

Technically, this was a another version of 'Jumanji', but a different universe. Originally it was not meant to be like that, because it was adapted from a series of children's book of the same name into a single movie. All the characters from the different books (book series) brought into one place, thus 'Jumanji' effect.

When the fictional book characters come into the life, a group of youngsters team up to save the town from invasion. A tale that takes place in one day, especially most of the narration was a one night adventure. Totally an unexpected movie, but still not a masterpiece than just entertaining product. Maybe the actors were the reason, especially inclusion of Jack Black was the turn out. His second collaboration with the director after 'Gulliver's Travels'. And not to forget the CGI work was very acceptable for a little production like this.

This theme was a very old, but the characters were unique. Maybe it was a box office lucky, but people won't simply acknowledge for useless things. This film's success was the effort of hard work. I won't surprise if they decide to make a sequel. I meant the same team, not the lower grade filmmakers and actors.

I have to say that being British born and bred I'm not at all familiar with Goosebumps, either the books or TV series etc, so I was going into this film blind as it were. With that in mind I'm not really able to review to fans of the original works.

I went in with the hope of a good time, I liked the sound of the concept, I like Jack Black and I knew it was going to be well produced and no doubt heavily laden with the latest technological effects (ironically I had watched the splendid Jason and the Argonauts prior to Goosebumps, from one extreme to another or what?!).

I got everything I expected and had fun without any frame of reference. If I wanted any more I could dig out some questions that would need to be answered, but why bother. I left at the end, as a middle aged film lover, contented. I would for sure keenly watch any sequel if it surfaces.

257445,Wuchak,"**_Fun family quasi-horror_**

A teenager (Dylan Minnette) moves to small town Madison, Delaware, where he hooks up with a cute neighbor (Odeya Rush), the daughter of grouchy author (Jack Black). Adventure and horror ensue when monsters are unwittingly loosed on the town.

I've never read any of RL Stine's popular books or viewed any of the corresponding videos, but I've always wanted to because they looked like fun, youth-oriented quasi-horror adventures, like Scooby Doo without the dog. Interestingly, the movie doesn't adapt one of Stine's stories, but rather has a plot that utilizes myriad of his (non) scary creations, like the abominable snowman, a creepy puppet, an ee-vil clown, a giant praying mantis, a werewolf, and so on.

The plot is reminiscent of 1995's ""Jumanji,"" but with the fun-horror trappings of 2006' ""Monster Night"" or ""Scooby Doo"" (but, again, without the dog). The main cast is a highlight with everyone shining in their roles, particularly winsome Odeya Rush, not to mention Halston sage in a small role. I like the revelation about one of the protagonists in the final act and the warmth that develops between the main characters. This is a good movie to unleash your inner-teenager and have a (non) spooky amusing time.

While it's superior to ""Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed,"" mainly because it's not as silly, it has the same core problem: The creators overstuffed the proceedings to the point of overkill. Instead of one or two monsters, there are like ten. So, while the set-up of the first act is great, the flick becomes too manic for its own good. Less is more.

It runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot in towns east and north of Atlanta, Georgia (Conyers, Gainesville, Madison and Marietta).

169,John Chard,"Very undervalued sequel suffering because of the first films success.

Los Angeles is imploding with mayhem as gang wars fill the streets, an under pressure police force try to restore order, but both parties have another foe to worry about, a Predator is in town, and he's about to up the ante.

Gone is Arnold Schwarzenegger, gone is John McTiernan, and gone is the jungle setting, so following in the foot steps of the ultimate beefcake movie that was Preadtor 1987 was an unenviable task it seems. Yet I personally feel that Predator 2 stands up to scrutiny as a fine entry into the sci-fi/action genre. Locating it among the urban decay of L.A. works real well, and pitting the Predator against a tough grizzled (but hardly giganticus beefcakeus) cop (Danny Glover) gives us a smart brains against brawn story. Also cutely is that director Stephen Hopkins and writers Jim & John Thomas have actually got the Predator cleaning up the streets of L.A., in fact another two hours of Predator hunt and kill tactics and crime in L.A. would have been completely eradicated! There is plenty of bloody snotty gore to appease fans of that persuasion, and it's nice to report that the characters on show do actually impact as part of the story.

Voodoo magic man!

It has a fine cast that reads like a who's who of action films, Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Bill Paxton (Aliens), Robert Davi (Die Hard), Gary Busey (Under Siege), Rubén Blades (Once Upon a Time in Mexico) & Maria Conchita Alonso (The Running Man), whilst Kevin Peter Hall dons the Predator suit and suitably kicks arse again. It's not genius, it's not even ground breaking, but Predator 2 is a fine and entertaining genre piece that sadly seems to forever be undervalued on internet forums.

It's not that _Predator 2_ is crap, it's just that it's **so much worse** than the original (one of the 5 best movies ever made), that it comes across as such a massive disappointment. With fresh, or I guess more accurately, with more experienced eyes, I don't mind _Predator 2_ at all, there's actually a lot of stuff I like about it. It's still not a great movie to me, but I don't skip it when I'm doing a marathon like I would have once upon a time. It expands upon the Predator lore in some pretty cool ways, and the Jamaican Voodoo Posse inspired my Escher Necromunda gang, so I've wound up pretty 50/50 on the whole thing.

A seriously B-list group of talent - Gary Busey (""Keyes"") and Adam Baldwin (""Garber"") amongst them, really help this descend quickly into a pit of mediocre special effects tinged with Glover's rather typical way of playing cop.

Despite that, the stories onscreen tend to be passable enough that I can watch them with ease.

There are some bits that are a tad too slow, though for the most part it's a harmless enough 90 minutes that it is watchable. I just mentioned that I find the characters to be forgettable, the same can be said for the voice talent to be honest. Everyone puts in an OK performance, nothing that noteworthy but, again, the plot does enough that it's not a big deal. As for a cast standout... Adam Sandler, I guess.

614696,Ricardo Oliveira,"""#Alive"" is a gripping and intense South Korean zombie movie directed by Il Cho and starring Yoo Ah-in and Park Shin-Hye. The film follows the story of a young man named Joon-woo (Yoo Ah-in) and a young woman named Yoo-bin (Park Shin-Hye) as they struggle to survive in their apartment complex during a zombie outbreak.

The movie is filled with suspense and tension from beginning to end, with the zombies serving as a constant threat that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The pacing of the movie is expertly done, with a gradual buildup of tension that leads to several heart-stopping moments.

One of the most impressive aspects of ""#Alive"" is the excellent acting by Yoo Ah-in and Park Shin-Hye. They both deliver powerful and nuanced performances, conveying a wide range of emotions as they battle both the zombies and their own inner demons. Their chemistry is palpable, and their relationship provides a sense of hope and humanity in an otherwise bleak and dangerous world.

The movie's visual effects and cinematography are also top-notch, with realistic and gruesome depictions of the zombie outbreak. The film makes excellent use of sound and lighting, creating an eerie and foreboding atmosphere that enhances the suspense and terror.

Another standout feature of ""#Alive"" is the way it explores themes of isolation, loneliness, and the human need for connection. Joon-woo and Yoo-bin are both isolated in their apartment complex, cut off from the outside world and unsure if anyone else is still alive. As they fight for their survival, they also struggle with feelings of loneliness and despair, highlighting the importance of human connection even in the face of a zombie apocalypse.

Overall, ""#Alive"" is a thrilling and engaging zombie movie that offers a fresh take on the genre. The film's excellent acting, pacing, and visuals make for an intense and unforgettable experience. I would rate ""#Alive"" a 7 out of 10.

A man in 1905 Wales (Dan Stevens) goes undercover as a member of a weirdo cult to save his captive sister on an isolated island.

""Apostle"" (2018) has a similar plot to “The Wicker Man” (1973/2006) and a setting akin to “The Village” (2004) and “The Ritual” (2017), but it’s the least of these.

The first half is a decent set-up; a little dull, but nice and mysterious with a fantastic setting and village set. Unfortunately, the second half devolves into half-baked horror cheese with a couple of random torture scenes to supposedly keep things ""exciting."" 

I was shocked at how bad the second half was -- bad flow, no finesse, ill-conceived, lack of consistency, too ambiguous -- just lousy wannabe-horror filmmaking. It’s like the director needed 20 more minutes to properly tell the story, but was pressured to keep the movie as close to 2 hours as he could and so clumsily forced the footage in the second half together.

Nevertheless, the movie's provocative upon reflection, particularly its commentary on human-made hybrid religions and the potential for corruption and abuse thereof. Think Jeroboam's syncretic religion when the northern kingdom of Israel broke from Judah; he concocted two golden calf idols and appointed illegitimate ""priests."" It was influenced by Judaism and featured some of its trappings, but left out the most important part (God).

The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes and was shot in Wales. I would like to see a ""Director's Cut"" that runs at least 2.5 hours with all the expository footage that was unfortunately left on the cutting room floor.

It has become very much a popular cult pic with Craven fans, which is understandable given the brisk pacing, moments of intensity and suspense, while the allegories and messages are smartly inserted. But the low budget does affect the product, it looks cheap and renders much of the violence and sexual aspects (implied or otherwise) as being not very frightening or stomach churning.

27374,prabhushakti,"This review contains spoilers. A documentary style film, as the director visualised in his mind, and a cheap belief of what it is based upon. I absolutely lost my patience while watching this movie, because I wanted to see a good movie and all it had is how it wanted to be, which I appreciate but unfortunately I hatred it because I was thinking why is it not in some informative channel's stupid shows than a movie? I thought about Häxan - 1922. A film, I love so much because not only it is entertaining but also very well shot and represented. I also thought about ""it follows"" which I believe is another great horror film in the history of cinema.
While watching this Australian director's film, I could not see what else it has that there never have been before or is it important as long as the film is good at it. Does this movie show us  anything we have never seen? I absolutely hated the poor direction of how the characters were told to talk about the tragedy! What I hated the most is the blend of dialogues and music. The cheap creepy background music was so high, that you absolutely have to feel the poor suspense the director forces us to feel so desperately, but it was so painful and disgusting far from disturbing. I only felt bad about the privacy of the family involved in the film, if it is based upon the real story which I don't wish to research on.
I will tell you my analysis about the first creepy photo of the dead body and last same living video of the creepy faced body:
A saddist murdered or psychopath did the horrible things to her face, who had all her possessions, and before killing her, he/she recorded her sadism and buried it in the ground so nobody could find it. Maybe he has been giving her drugs and raping her, which caused her to go through anxiety or depression of death and all those nightmare. Maybe the sadist is not anymore than the Hungarian hypnotiser. Now irrational but dumb people would like it, and some cheap people would spend some bucks to turn it to the most horrible horror film.

A 16 year-old girl disappears in the water in a rural area of Australia and family members & others claim they see apparitions of her while various secrets are slowly unveiled.    

“Lake Mungo” (2008) is a mystery Indie with a bit ’o horror, but in the style of a mockumentary, aka fake documentary. 

Like ""Curse of the Blair Witch,” which was released three weeks before the found footage hit “The Blair Witch Project” in 1999, “Lake Mungo” consists of fake interviews with several people about the central topic, as well as examination of some found footage. ""Curse of the Blair Witch” worked because it only ran 44 minutes whereas this one is twice as long and the fact that it’s all an act pretending to be a documentary can’t sustain interest. I suppose if you thought it was real it might be more compelling.     

The brother’s revelation (no spoilers) is odd in that it takes away from what the docudrama is trying to do.  For me, the first 53 minutes of constant phony interviews is pretty tedious. Thankfully things perk up in the final 34 minutes. Although the first revelation thereof goes nowhere, the second one (the one that occurs at the titular lake) is well done and certainly creepy, not to mention an intriguing concept.

I’m sure everything ties together if you reflect on it, but IMHO it’s not worth the effort because the flick just isn’t compelling for the bulk of the first hour. And the payoff isn’t enough to make it worth the investment UNLESS maybe you’re a devotee of mockumentaries or found footage flicks. Add to this the aggravation of the pendulum swinging back-and-forth regarding the nature of the paranormal happenings (she is a ghost; she isn’t a ghost, ad nauseam). 

That said, the movie is well made for what it is, the actors are convincing and I enjoyed seeing that part of southeast Australia. 

The film runs 1 hour, 27 minutes, and was shot in Ararat, which is a 2 hours’ drive west of Melbourne, and Mildura, which is 3.5 hours north of Ararat.

Dark Skies is written and directed by Scott Stewart. It stars Keri Russell, Josh Hamilton, Dakota Goyo, Kaden Rockett and J.K. Simmons. Music is by Joseph Bishara and cinematography by David Boyd.

Two possibilities exist... Either we are alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying. - Arthur C. Clarke 

Movies involving alien visitations are notoriously tricky things to execute, there's a very thin line between cerebral willingness and crummy construction. Dark Skies unsurprisingly is another in a long line of sci-fi/horror movies that divides the respective genre followers. 

Plot finds the Barrett family home suddenly succumbing to mysterious phenomena, suicidal birds, time lapses, poltergeist activity, nightmares and body markings et al...

It's a film that most definitely didn't deliver the spook fest that the (mixed) marketing campaign suggested, while it unfortunately comes off as a collage of well known genre titles of recent pasts. Add to this some less than great acting from the adult leads, the complete waste of J.K. Simmons in a very promising role, and unoriginality of concepts, then it's not hard to see why it has been the victim of venom in some quarters.

However, Scott Stewart is not guilty of taking the easy route to genre cinema as per production. There's no over reliance on CGI, or for big booms and crashes to startle in the name of cheap thrills, in fact the scare scenes are well placed and well timed. He also proves to be a very good purveyor of slow burn atmospherics, itself something that can alienate the more boisterous and excitable genre fans.

The vision of a suburban American family under siege is well played out, the little trials and tribulations of a working class family not swamping the big objective, so when things gather apace and the child actors come to the fore, time invested by the patient is rewarded.

It was one of the long due film, despite releasing just 4 years ago. Those who saw it said me not to miss it. But they also warned me it was a common horror theme with a slight change in the storyline. Since horror is the least average rated genre in my collection, I was not expecting it to be a masterpiece. That could be another reason why I liked it. Yeah, the same old blueprint horror flick, even though it was not as bad as what some people are saying. Except the opening quote reveals most of the film's twist. And the twist at the end was not actually a twist if a person knew it before.

A small family struggling with finances, lately witnessing some strange events in the house. But once it takes a serious turn, now they must find a solution for it, or else the unity might fall apart. After getting some idea of everything happening, they meet an expert and gain some important inputs. Now their fightback begins, the challenge they are about to face going to decide the future of the family. Their plan and its execution, the remaining film is to tell us what happens to them.

The JK Simmon's role was one of the most overused roles is horror films. I did not like that, but I liked his appearance. It is also an open end if this film gets a sequel. Like usual when a family struggling, people around them going blind were a cliché. Yeah, I know horror films can't get out of such thing. It's very rare to see a film out of these platforms. Yet it was an okay film, if you prefer a decent entertainment over an experimental film, which is not guaranteed entertainment. But usually it is an enjoyable flick by most of the people. Despite familiarity, one would have a nice time with it.

25983,John Chard,"This one night changes everything for me.

Ti West seems destined to be one of those horror film directors who forever will polarise opinions. For those of us who love the slow burn approach and admire his evident adoration of retro horror, then he hits the mark. Reference The House of the Devil and latterly The Innkeepers. If those two things don't strike a chord with you then it's very likely that The House of the Devil will drive you nuts -  but not in a good way.

Plot is simple, Jocelin Donahue plays student Samantha Hughes, who has found the ideal apartment to live in, but needs funds to pay the deposit. Sooooo, answering a flyer advertising for a babysitter, she winds up at some spooky house out in the sticks, where the job isn't exactly what was as expected, and, well the night isn't as expected either...

It's her own fault really, if you ring the bell at a spooky isolated house and Tom Noonan answers the door, well then you should know better than not to run away! But I digress. West's film taps into the satanic panic that gripped certain parts of the states in the 70s and 80s, set in the early 80s the film is a vibrant homage to that era, with a real sense of time and place pulsing away as Samantha is set up for a night of god knows what.

The house is a splendid old creaker and within it Samantha always looks to be one cat's whisker away from being in peril. West doesn't go for continuous boo-jump scares, he lets us and Samantha use our imaginations to unnerve all parties. The screw is slowly turned until hell comes to the party, moving things swiftly to a frenetic finale that closes with a final denouement that old nick himself would approve of.

Dee Wallace Stone does a cameo to add more to the retro flavours, while Noonan and Donahue are superb. It's a film that is patient and asks you for your patience, so those of that ilk, and retro horror hounds too, will love it. Others, not so! 7/10",2015-10-26T15:48:40.118Z,7.0,The House of the Devil,2009

This movie has a very old school feel to it, giving me flashbacks to the original _Halloween_ and _Friday the 13th_ with its film quality, atmosphere, and audio effects/music. I really enjoyed this aspect, and it left me feeling somewhat nostalgic. These feelings did not carry over to the rest of the film. I thought the plot was fine, although the main characters incredibly stupid decisions were the catalyst for the entire story. This is fine in slashers or an action horror film as the kills are what you are there for, but with this it felt cheap and left me unsatisfied. The movie lingers on scenes all too often, resulting in a very slow pace. I understand these long-drawn-out sequences were supposed to build tension, but it was not effective, and left be bored. I really wanted to enjoy this more than I did and unfortunately the best I can give this is an average rating.

3036,Wuchak,"***Gothic mania with Kenneth Branagh, Robert DeNiro and Helena Bonham Carter***

Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version of the oft-filmed Frankenstein story was the most faithful to Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel up to that point, which explains its name. It features fine actors and looks great (sets, costumes, locations, etc). There are several quality scenes, like the creature's time spent with the peasant family where his unseen help is taken for a ""good spirit of the woods.""

The first time I viewed the movie I was a little turned off by its manic style. People are introduced, scenes flash by, times shift and the soundtrack blares, which struck me as overdone. The characters seemed so melodramatic at times, emoting, yelling, running, confronting, fighting, dying: ""Ahhhhhh!!"" ""NoooOOOOOoooooo!!!"" I just wanted them to stop, take their meds, and chill for 5-10 minutes. I’ve since read Shelley’s book and watched the even more faithful version, Hallmark’s “Frankenstein” (2004) with Luke Goss playing the creature, which runs almost 3 hours.

Seeing this version again I appreciated it more and was able to see how Branagh provides a nice balance between the hyper moments and more subdued sequences. If it sometimes seems too manic it’s because Branagh tried to cram the bulk of the novel into 2 hours. On the positive side, this makes it play better for those who prefer constant thrills, melodrama, etc. The 2004 version has almost another hour to play with and is more subdued and brooding. This one’s more of a “blockbuster.”

Speaking of the 2004 rendition, the creature is more faithful to the book (with long black hair and white teeth), but he’s also too handsome in a dark gothic way, resembling Type O Negative’s Peter Steele. The creature in this version removes the hair and opts for a more gruesome depiction, which fits Victor’s description of the creature as “hideous.” In any case, De Niro does a fine job in the role. 

My favorite part is when the monster finds sanctuary with the rural family, unbeknownst to them. It helps the viewer get to know the creature and have compassion on his plight, but soon all sympathy is pretty much lost. On the other hand, he IS a 'monster’; and he has an interesting discussion with Victor in his remote glacial dwelling in the high country, which helps explain his actions. The locket-framing sequence is lame, but that was a weak point of the novel as well.

While this version and the 2004 one are the most faithful to Shelley’s book, they each omit parts and change certain things. For instance, both omit Victor’s traveling to Scotland and, later, Ireland, which was a good call. This version alters a certain character’s death to a lynching while in the novel it was court-ordered hanging. Regardless, I enjoyed the surprise plot turn in the last act, which I’m not going to give away. And the tragic ending is well executed. 

""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" is similar to ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992) in that they both look awesome and were produced by Francis Ford Coppola. Any problems are due to translating convoluted 19th century gothic horror classics to modern cinema. 

The film runs 2 hours, 3 minutes, and was shot in England (Shepperton Studios) and the Swiss Alps.

3036,DocTerminus,"Kenneth Branagh made quite an artistic hit with his first film **HENRY V**. Next, he had great critical and financial success with his popcorn flick,** DEAD AGAIN**!  The success of both of those films meant he could take on any project he wanted.  He chose **MARY SHELLY'S FRANKENSTEIN**.  He would return to direct and star as Victor Frankenstein.  He would bring along many of his friends including Patrick Doyle to add another aggressive and bombastic score. Because of his newfound clout, he was able to bring in Oscar winning screenwriter Frank Darabont (**THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION**, **CRASH**).  Maybe his greatest display of the young directors status was bringing in Robert DeNiro to portray the creature!  The resulting film with all of this incredible talent is...

_silly._

I didn't have any good memories of the film in theaters in 1994.  Especially awkward was DeNiro's creature spinning toward the camera and yelling _""Frankenstein!!!""_ which brought nothing but laughter from the crowd.  I hoped my re-watch in 2022 would bring me a new perspective.  While there were there things I noticed that I now appreciated, the flick is still silly. 

It must be said that Branagh's vision for the film is strong and clear.  Darabont's script is very clever and multi-faceted.  The music is excellent wall to wall support and some of the performances are noteworthy.  Unfortunately, much of the subtlety in Darabont's script is lost in the big, loud film.  Branagh's decision to showcase the birth of the creature as quasi-erotic is interesting, shirtless and sweating under firelight.  His decision to have the brilliant doctor, when exposing his feelings of guilt, loses his ability to speech clearly and seems to mimic the creatures meter.  We get it... who is actually the monster? Again, clear but over-the-top. Mostly missing are moments of circumspection and quiet.

With its big budget and generally beautiful lighting and cinematography, it would seem this would be the type of bad movie that is fun to watch.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work on that level either, as the film bounces between high art pretentiousness and lowest of gross out humor.

I believe Branagh succeeded in getting his vision onto the screen and he has no reason to look down on his achievement. But as a big fan of his, I won't be with him with this monster.",2022-02-04T07:07:56.073Z,4.0,Frankenstein,1994
3036,CinemaSerf,"This could have been a far better interpretation of the wonderful story of the man-monster but it lacks potency. Frequently a problem when one of the stars is also the director; the focus becomes a bit blurred and in this - despite the super performance of Robert de Niro in the title role - the result is a rather meandering story devoid of the usual swathe of emotions ""Frankenstein"" usually evokes. Aiden Quinn is ""Walton"" an explorer obsessed with reaching the North Pole. When his ship collides with an iceberg, they are stranded only to encounter ""Victor"" (Kenneth Branagh) who proceeds to regale them with his story of how he, as a brilliant student attempted to cheat death by creating a creature restored from death. The scientist succeeds, but rejects his abhorrent creation to the elements expecting it to perish. It doesn't and is soon on it's own path of revenge on it's creator and on those whom he loves. To it's credit, it has none of the bolt-through-the-neck stuff; it is closer to the original story and has little of the James Whale to it; but it also lacks soul and ""humanity"". On paper, a great cast should have added depth to the story, but somehow there is just too much going on, the story is allowed to meander and the empathy and pity normally felt for the monster just saps away leaving us with quite an hollow shell of a recollection. The imagery is great, though - from the costumes and make-up through to the menacing lighting; all contributing well to the aesthetic of this tale of late 18th century science and morality. It's worth a watch, but this is still story that cinema needs to do more justice to.",2023-08-26T15:27:21.377Z,6.0,Frankenstein,1994
244458,mattwilde123,"'The Voices' is a very dark comedy from graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi. It tells the story of a man named Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) who works in a bathtub factory. Jerry continuously sees a psychiatrist (Jacki Weaver) as he tries to live a normal life whilst dealing with his mental afflictions. He decides to pursue his office crush (Gemma Arterton) but soon finds himself in a murderous situation when she fails to reciprocate his advances. Jerry's schizophrenia means that he hears voices specifically from his pets who give him help and advice.

Satrapi directs the piece with a surprisingly heartfelt and empathetic way. The lack of colour and light (such as when Jerry is on his limiting medication) contrast really well with the scenes where the main character is free and feels at peace. There are very graphic scenes of murder which highlight the brutality of his actions reminding the audience of the morality of Jerry's actions. The music is also very fitting and turns drastically into a horror-themed score when the drama switches.

The screenplay is funny in a lot of places. Before I watched the film, I thought I would find similarities with HBO's 'Dexter' as it deals with a likeable killer whilst also being humorous. But, after watching, I feel that the film owes a lot to Mary Harron's 'American Psycho' as it shares similar themes of delusion and indulgence. However, the dialogue was a bit forced at times and I usually find myself cringing when watching a British actress (in this case Gemma Arterton) having to read lines written in a very stereotypical way.

Ryan Reynolds is fantastic as the main character and really makes the audience feel for his character. Reynolds completely embodies the main character's innocence and is a genuinely nice man. Even more impressive is the fact that Reynolds also performs voices for his pets which include a Scottish cat and a Texan dog. I had a slight problem with other members of the cast who I felt were not quite up to the standard that Reynolds set although Jacki Weaver was great as his psychiatrist and Anna Kendrick did a good job at playing his love interest.

Overall, I feel that 'The Voices' was a surprisingly good film. It was funny and very well acted. 'The Voices' is a little hidden gem that a lot of people who are fans of small and strange indie comedies would love.

After her mother dies in a tragedy, a teen girl (Emily Browning) is sent to a mental hospital. Upon returning to her father’s mansion on the coast of Maine, she reunites with her older sister (Arielle Kebbel) and tries to get along with her dad’s new girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks), her mother’s former nurse, who appears to be taking over. David Strathairn plays the father, a successful author.

“The Uninvited” (2009) is a mystery/horror that combines elements of “The Sixth Sense” (1999), “Half Light” (2006) and “The Ring” (2002), although it’s a little more subdued than the latter. If you like the haunting tone of those movies and the spectacular locations of the latter two, you’ll appreciate it. Browning with her ultra-cute face was 20 during filming, but looks 14. Meanwhile Banks is effective as the biyatch gold-digger and Strathairn is convincing as the clueless father.

The story plays out in a too-predicable manner. If you saw the trailer beforehand it basically tells you everything you need to know. But not really: The last 15 minutes pulls the rug out with some surprising revelations. I heard there was a twist before viewing and went over various possibilities in my mind while watching, but the movie fooled me. Great job on this front. Not everything is as it appears. I’d say more, but I don’t want to spoil it.

My relatively high rating is due to the lingering power of the film's message on individual perception. It's potent and applicable stuff, expertly executed.

The film doesn’t overstay its welcome at a mere 1 hour, 27 minutes. It wasn’t shot in the Northeast, however, but obviously British Columbia (Bowen Island). It’s an American remake of the Korean film “A Tale of Two Sisters” (2003).

Released in 1993 and directed by George Sluizer from a novel by Tim Krabbé, ""The Vanishing"" is a crime drama/mystery/horror about a man (Kiefer Sutherland) whose girlfriend goes missing during a trip in Washington State (Sandra Bullock) and he searches in vain for her for years. After he starts a relationship with a new girlfriend (Nancy Travis), the abductor (Jeff Bridges) finally contacts him. Will he find his former girlfriend?

This is the second time the director shot this same story; the first time was the 1988 Euro film of the same name. The stories are identical except for the final acts and the fact that this newer version has a better character/part for the new girlfriend (Travis). Both films are worth catching, but I prefer this one for reasons explained below. Fans of the first movie object to the changes, arguing that the producers of this version were pandering to North American tastes. While this may be true, it's also likely that the director didn't want to make the same exact movie. After all, we already have the first version, why make an exact duplicate with different actors and locations? Besides, what's wrong with appreciating BOTH versions? My comments below reveal why Sluizer wanted to change things up a little with this version.

Audiences may have rejected the film at the box office on the grounds that they weren't used to Bridges playing a contemptible villain or Sutherland playing the good guy, but they're both fine in these roles, particularly the former, who's great and fascinating to observe. One thing that keeps you watching during the drama of the first two acts is to find out what his motivations are. But, as hinted above, it's Travis who steals the show, at least as far as protagonists goes. Perhaps audiences didn't receive her or the movie well because her character's merely a waitress whose story arc doesn't end in a reversal of fortune, which is in contrast to the typical movie heroine. Who knows? I think she's awesome.

In any case, if you like psychological drama/thrillers like ""Fatal Attraction"" (1987) and ""Single White Female"" (1992) you'll appreciate ""The Vanishing.""

The movie runs 109 minutes and was shot mostly in Washington State, but also Cody Tunnel, Cody, Wyoming (the tunnel sequence) and La Canada and Long Beach, CA (the diner and pool hall scenes respectively).

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've watched the movie)

While the first film could be interpreted as a commentary on nihilism, since the villain wins and the hero loses, it doesn't HAVE to be interpreted this way. After all, it's a simple fact of life that sometimes evil wins a battle now and then; and sometimes A LOT of them, but this doesn't mean evil wins the war, so to speak. If there's ultimate good then evil will eventually have its day of reckoning.

In any event, the 1988 movie ends on a decidedly downbeat note. And this is why I appreciate this newer version: While it is also downbeat, and evil wins to a point, the changes in the final act show good triumphing over evil, not to mention perseverance over intellect and love over absence of love. The subtext is all about freewill – freewill to kill for no good reason and freewill to kill for good when absolutely necessary. The theme of the first movie is limited in that it drives home the first point whereas this version drives home both, and is the better for it.",2021-04-27T08:00:49.125Z,7.0,The Vanishing,1993

The Mindhunters of the title are a group of FBI profilers who as part of their training are sent to a remote island to solve a mock crime in a mock town. Their mission is to form a profile of a serial killer known as The Puppeteer, trouble is, is that The Puppeteer turns out to be real and starts picking them off one by one.

Directed by Renny Harlin and featuring a bonkers story written by Wayne Kramer, it doesn't take an FBI profiler to know what sort of film this is going to be. Featuring a cast that contains LL Cool J, Jonny Lee Miller, Patricia Velásquez, Val Kilmer and Christian Slater, Mindhunters is undeniably preposterous cinema for the easily pleased masses, and yet it's still hugely enjoyable and isn't found wanting in the ingenuity stakes. 

The killers secret is closely guarded, which keeps the Ten Little Indians (yes this is another Agatha cover version) like mystery going, and the manner of the deaths have a morbid freshness about them - with one in particular being outrageously thrilling. A few scenes are neatly crafted by Harlin, who is after all is no slouch in the action genre (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, The Long Kiss Goodnight), while the swimming pool finale is taut and tight and the killer reveal genuinely a surprise. 

Yes there's problems abound in the film, but isn't there always in this kind of ""B"" movie hogwash? The cast do what is required as they work through some pretty naff dialogue, and any expectation about caring for any of these characters should be set at option zero. However, it's a nice fit for Harlin, as it finds him comfortable in the knowledge that we want whizz bang murder death kill, and thus he delivers. Expectation of anything else is pure folly and one directs you towards René Clair's excellent 1945 film, And Then There Were None if you need something a bit more solid in your murder mystery diet. 7/10",2019-05-05T07:01:35.668Z,7.0,Mindhunters,2004

Larry Hagman did a sequel fourteen years later called “Beware! the Blob” (aka “Son of Blob”) after his rise to TV stardom with I Dream of Jeannie and before his return to popularity as J.R. in Dallas. It throws in quirky comedic bits amidst the serious horror and it is interesting to compare the two movies because of the social changes brought about by the radical events of the 60s. The sequel is an entertaining window into the counterculture of that time (specifically 1971 when the film was shot) and how the hippies or semi-hippies gelled with those of traditional culture. To me, it wasn’t a big deal as there’s always a “generation gap” between young and old in every decade, which can be observed even in the original film.

A quality remake of the original movie came out in 1988 and, like “Beware! The Blob,” walked the balance beam between utter horror and amusing non-horror. It had a bigger budget compared to Hagman’s film, but the addition of a subplot revealing the creature's origins as decidedly earth-centric took away from the Blob's otherworldly and creepy ambiance. Still, it’s a worthwhile reimagining.   

The movie runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot entirely in southeast Pennsylvania in areas west of Philadelphia (Phoenixville, Downingtown, Valley Forge, Royersford & Chester Springs).

14451,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Given my Scandinavian origin and being a bit of a fan of all kinds of science fiction, fantasy, action and horror movies I of course had to have Dead Snow in my collection. Last Saturday me and my son got around to watch it.

Dead Snow is a pretty classical teenage-group-gets-into-big-mess-with-supernatural-beings kind of horror movie. In this particular case a group of teenagers goes for a hike in the Norwegian mountains where they camp in cabin. Not very original of course but what the heck, it is a zombie horror movie so…

One thing that makes the movie a bit original is that it is not so totally over the top with foul language and insane consumption of all kinds of drugs as the standard Hollywood crap. These teenagers actually behave fairly normally drinking a few beers and having a good time. Well that is until the mysterious stranger, who is in the movie just to set up the mood, shows up and tells his story about a unusually cruel Nazi officer and his men. Of course we all know where things are going from there…

Here the movie starts to follow the usual recipe for these kind of movies. Naturally one of the teenagers needs to take care of some natural needs and separates himself from the rest of the party. Then follows the obligatory boy and girl having sex scene. This time in a old-fashioned Scandinavian “skithus” separated from the actual cabin. Anyone who has ever used one of these (I have and they stink) would know that you have to be pretty horny, drunk or both to have sex in one of those. Anyway, that was one less teenager in the party.

Slowly the zombies become more frequent and the dire situation the party is in becomes more and more evident. As the zombies become more frequent so does the gory sequences and eventually the movie turns more into a comedy than a horror movie. I have to say that the Tommy Wirkola have little to learn from his Hollywood counterparts when it comes to horror movie violence. Body parts, external as well as internal, flies around like there was no tomorrow. Which for most of the characters involved is exactly the way it is.

On the whole this movie was one part classical horror movie and one part comedy and I found it quite entertaining but you have to be into these kinds of movies to feel that way of course.",2015-09-28T08:21:07.943Z,7.0,Dead Snow,2009
155084,Reno,"**The quick money does not come from easy way!**

It is a remake of the Thai film '13 Beloved'. Not seen the original film, but this is a very familiar theme. Some good films were already made out of it and this one is slightly different. It is about a man who is expecting a baby with his girlfriend who he is going marry very soon. But he gets fired from his job and clueless about raising a child and maintain the family. Then a strange phone call gives him a series of challenges to win with a greater reward. It all begins with a small easy task and then begin to complicate when he can't back off as per the rules he has agreed. Now how far he goes to finish it off what he had started was told in the rest of the film.

Since this is not a fresh idea for a film, I expected the story to be very good, but a little disappointed. At least it opened well and overall first half was much better. Later the film did not stand up to what it was promised in the earlier. But kind of unpredictable way it was developed. Seeing how the film was received, those who liked the original version did not like this one. That happens all the time as expected. Even though if you haven't seen the Thai film, the chances are slim one to enjoy it, especially if you have seen and liked the films like '12 Rounds', 'The Game', including the recent 'Nerve'. Not bad for watching at once, but instead I would suggest other similar title if you ask me.

The plot line was fairly predictable, even with the twists and turns. Characters consistently make stupid decisions for plot's sake, even though that is the M.O. for slasher films, I expected a bit more from A24. The slasher elements were barely present, even though I knew that coming in, the marketing still makes this look like a different movie altogether. The comedy was lackluster, I understand it was suppose to be dry social commentary based humor, but I did not really find it funny one bit. Even with all my critiques, I still found this movie somewhat enjoyable.

520023,CinemaSerf,"So a group of fairly unlikeable, spoiled, rich kids gather at the home of one of their number ahead of an impending hurricane. As conditions turn particularly nasty outside (think ""Devil Wears Prada""), they decide to play an hybrid game of ""Cleudo"" meets ""Ten Little Indians"" that involves someone being given a piece of paper with a cross on it. That person has to ""kill"" one of their entirely deserving friends. Thereafter, they all reconvene to deduce who the killer is and if they get it wrong, then off they go again... Things take a turn for the worst when, infused with cocaine and booze, they start to fall out and their host ""David"" (the panda-impersonator Pete Davidson) strops off, the power goes down and next thing he is found quite literally bouncing off the patio doors with his throat slit. Whodunit? What now ensues is a messy, expletive-ridden character study of half a dozen women who are all too readily suspicious of each other. Two of them are lovers, with a third on the periphery of that very new relationship and another has brought her rather curious boyfriend along. The seeds are sown for a sea of discord right from the get-go. At times, the dialogue is really quite good fun, delivering quite an abrasively effective analysis of these fairly stupid and odious youngsters and playing well on their vacuousness and mistrust. All to often, though, the language becomes almost puerile. A good old dose of Anglo-Saxon can work, but when repeated as often as it is here, it loses any real potency. Indeed here, it borders on the hysterical - but not in an any way menacing manner. The acting, well that's another story. It's terrible. Quite simply, nobody here ought to worry about being troubled by any juries during awards season. That's a shame, because just a little more discerning effort on the casting front could really have lifted this, especially as the ending is really quite amusing. At times the production design offers us quite a claustrophobic environment, helped along nicely by the prevailing weather conditions - but sadly, that can't excuse the mediocrity of the talent delivering here, and I left the cinema unimpressed.",2022-09-13T09:56:53.962Z,6.0,Bodies Bodies Bodies,2022

I spent the entire runtime of Bodies Bodies Bodies wondering why this movie was so well received and highly rated. The plot doesn’t kick in until around halfway through, and the audience is left to endure young 20-somethings complaining, making out, and wondering why the world didn’t revolve around them for 45 minutes. The weak dialogue is dreadful to the point of making me wonder if any of it was actually written or just ad-libbed. Unfortunately, once the bodies start dropping, even the mystery of a vicious murderer plays the background to the self-absorbed spoiled brats whining and spilling each other’s secrets. At one point, the story attempts to shoehorn the murderer killing the victims in the order of the game, but even the characters in the movie don’t buy it. The cast does a convincing job of portraying a bunch of immature narcissists reacting to such a high-stress situation. I was so bored and disappointed until the final 3 minutes. The final twist is unique and entertaining but wasn’t worth the trash that had to be tolerated for an hour and a half to get there.",2022-09-24T04:28:07.211Z,5.0,Bodies Bodies Bodies,2022

Everyone onscreen worked for me. Amandla Stenberg, Maria Bakalova and Rachel Sennott stick out, though Myha'la, Chase Sui Wonders, Pete Davidson and Lee Pace aren't majorly far off. Their characters, if not bad, aren't actually as great, so credit to the actors for elevating their roles.

94 minutes was the perfect run time, any longer then I think it may have dragged quite a bit. Thankfully, it didn't.

41446,Nathan,"**_Scream 4_ breaks the mold of the franchise, delivering brutal kills and suspenseful scenes that keep the audience engaged throughout the entire runtime.**

The story is pretty weak, requiring quite a suspension of disbelief, as is the case with the majority of the Scream sequels. The introduction of new family members of Sidney Prescott felt a little out of place, with no mention of an aunt in the previous films. But all that aside, this movie delivers on what I have been wanting throughout the entire franchise: blood, gore, and brutality. The majority of slasher films have poor plots, but that is not why you are there, you want uncensored horror. With Scream 4, the blood is cranked to a hundred, with crime scenes left with the walls repainted, intestines falling out of victims, and slits that ooze with blood with every heartbeat. Not only are the kills brutal, but our Ghostface is too. His phone calls have a tremendous amount of anger, with some lines being incredibly messed up. Overall, it was a real treat to watch. In addition, the meta-commentary worked pretty well for me unlike the previous films; I do not know if it is just a product of the times, as I was only a child when the first trilogy was released, so quite a bit of references could have flown over my head.

Much like previous films, the new characters did not do much for me. They lacked any interesting details and were merely there to be meat sacks for our killer's knife to enter, and enter they did. Hayden Panettiere was a standout, who I especially enjoyed though. Emma Roberts was okay; she never really seemed convincing in the role she was attempting to play. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox are badasses once again; I will never get sick of seeing them kick Ghostface’s ass while attempting to avoid death. I have been pretty critical of David Arquette throughout the series, but in Scream 4, he did a great job and really added a lot to the movie.

Wes Craven did an excellent job with the direction of this film. Where Scream 3 felt generic and uninspired, Scream 4 felt like a real passion project for him, with an infusion of new ideas to keep the series fresh. It was easily my favorite directorial performance since the original.

Overall, I really enjoyed Scream 4 and think it is the first film to actually rival the original. With a slightly tighter story, this film could have easily been the best in the series.

""Malignant is yet another excellent origin movie for a new franchise created by one of the most successful horror filmmakers of the century, James Wan. The talented director picks up a thematically rich, mysteriously intriguing narrative written by the feature film debutant Akela Cooper, and lets himself get inspired by the giallo genre. Boasting a fascinating protagonist brilliantly interpreted by Annabelle Wallis, the unexpected yet exposition-heavy revelations of the brave third act definitely improve upon a rather generic, unexciting first half. While the impressive action sequences steal the technical spotlight, Joseph Bishara's score holds divisive creative choices that might not please every viewer.

619778,Nathan,"Malignant is a ride, one that changes directions in multiple different ways that I did not expect. This film is an ambitious genre bend that takes tropes from slashers (loved the Friday the 13th/Halloween cords used in the beginning of the film), the classic James Wan ghost films, action, and strangely enough some elements from Scream in the comedy side. With some many different themes it was hard to really understand what this movie's identity was. The film had a serious tone throughout but had some awkward lines that felt right out of a Scream film. With those two different tones it felt as if the lines were funny bad writing rather than artistic vision.

The kills were bloody as all hell, which is par for the course with the slasher genre and a positive for this film. The reversed humanoid figure visuals for the killer were very incredibly unsettling.

I really enjoyed the plot for the most part, even though I felt the beginning and the end were much stronger than the middle lull. The twist was great, and I did not see it coming till it was almost too late. When this happens the movie really finds it grove and kept me locked in for the remaining twenty minutes.

Overall, Malignant is decent movie, maybe a little too ambitious for its own good.

Jeepers Creepers tips its hat off to the creepy horror movies that were all the rage in the 70s and early 80s, boasting genuine suspense and characters fully formed, Jeepers Creepers is something of a refreshing antidote to the ream of horror movies available that line up teenagers purely to be slasher fodder. Lifting it just above average is the fact that our two sibling protagonists have viable discussions before venturing into the realm of horror staple requirements, although the picture is ""B"" movie in substance, it does however attempt to be credible in its story telling.

Sadly though, after a wonderfully edgy first half, the picture drops down in standard, the introduction of ""The Creeper"" may well be a necessity, but it shifts the film to such a degree, it rapidly loses its creepy momentum. Not that the second half of the film is a disaster, far from it, it's got a scary fun vibe to it, it's just that it promises so much, but ultimately runs out of steam. Jeepers Creepers was successful enough to spawn inferior sequels, with the ""Creeper"" of the piece firmly entering the horror hall of fame, thus an argument for the film having done its job seems totally viable, it's just sad that it didn't stay on the side of edgy and become a horror classic. 6/10",2019-04-15T01:23:20.690Z,6.0,Jeepers Creepers,2001

Personally, instead of making these places a crime, people should be able to add infrastructure as needed, but it is the primer for the events of the actual movie.  Chased down into the catacombs, they basically just keep going towards insanity.

There are so many good points in the psychological horror of it all, and the great unknown of the caves plus random acts of terror makes a great formula for the events of this movie.

There’s a chance that this was lost on some viewers. Perhaps it’s just the found-footage fatigue. It’s a shame that the ratings fail to reflect the film’s merits; it’s one of the more inventive entries in the found-footage horror subgenre. The frights are expertly staged, with little reliance on cheap jump scares, instead creating a foreboding mood that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The setting, an underground maze of catacombs beneath the streets of Paris, adds to the film’s eerie atmosphere and gives it a unique twist on the typical haunted house tale.

Anthony Mackie is excellent. It's hard to not subconsciously see Marvel's Falcon, but overall he is an effective dramatic lead. The chemistry with  fellow EMT Jamie Dorn is believable and authentic and adds poignancy to the films more dramatic moments.

They visit some well crafted scenes where they are called in as EMT's, and their weary ""been here, done that "" banter is effective.

Casting aside the film's boast of real life credentials, the question hangs on if it's actually any good?. 

McLean has crafted a genuinely unsettling picture, one that upon theatrical release didn't in truth live up to the hyperbole that was so boisterously marketed back in 2005. Now that the furore has long since passed and the tag-lines running about ""A new dawn in terror"" and that the ""Reality is here"" have since faded away from memory, what is actually left to sample?.

McLean's film builds up nicely by letting us get to know our three soon to be troubled protagonists. Then it's enter Mick Taylor from outback stage right, and here is a larger than life bogeyman and one of the modern eras better, and yes, scarier creations. Taylor, excellently portrayed by John Jarratt, debunks the myth of the chirpy Aussie bushman, becoming the polar opposite to ""Crocodile Dundee"" (given a mention in one particular uneasy exchange). Then the terror starts, grim violence and unnerving dialogue seamlessly blends together, all shot in a docu-style on Hi-Def DV. 

However, with this narrative trajectory, where the usual formula escape attempts begin to arise, comes the exasperation that so often blights the horror genre. One particular opportunity that lands at Liz Hunter's feet, an opportunity that any sane person in the world would have taken, beggars belief, but then I guess if common sense ruled there would be no post script at the end - which is a post script that blatantly wants us to believe that what we have just watched really happened...

The last quarter is a touch rushed, and that's a shame since we have spent so much time in the company of the three actually likable and believable youths. It rather feels like a quick horror fix than the intended protracted line in terror that Mclean and co were going for. Nevertheless, it does actually work, and crucially it does frighten and hold the utmost attention. 

The performances are strong, dodgy British accents aside, with the girls (Cassandra Magrath & Kestie Morassi) in particular convincing as being truly terrified. While the piece is, surprisingly in context of the material, beautiful at times. Red sunsets and the crisp dusky desert come vividly out the screen thanks to Will Gibson's excellent photography. Wolf Creek will not and can't hold up on repeat viewings, but it is still an effective entry in the horror genre, and with Jarratt's Mick Taylor there is a character that's unlikely to be forgotten in a hurry. 7/10",2019-10-23T22:20:47.267Z,7.0,Wolf Creek,2005

I think in this situation, I'm as close as you get to the average movie goer. No agenda, no attachments. That being said, this film is terrible. Burton spent so much effort and time worrying about making this film Gothic and off pace, stuffing his favorite actors into the film even though half of their parts were pointless, he forgot he was making a film. It's a simple and fun idea but it feels like ego and ""showiness"" kept them from making the plot even make sense. We get it Tim! You are weird! Don't ruin a good performance by Depp and a fun idea for a film because you have to live up to your own Gothic standards. Grow up.

By the way.... wasn't this supposed to be the 70's? Other than a shot or two of trees and a hippie van it was just like the set of Sweeney Todd. The whole film felt like London in the 40's.

62213,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I generally like Tim Burton as well as  Johnny Depp. This movie was no exception. It is a dark (of course with Tim Burton) comedy with some hint of action/thriller in it. I would not really characterize it as a horror movie even though there are a vampire as well as a witch and a werewolf in it. Of course there is the romance stuff but I personally feel that is really more of a background or justification to the plot than anything else.

This is not a magnificent movie but it’s a good movie. I have never seen the original series so I am not biased by that. It seems that many people that considers this to be a bad movie refers to the original show. I have read several of the critical reviews and I do not agree with most of them.

I found this movie to be a nice, moderately paced, comedy in a vampire/gothic setting. The mood and the wackiness were fairly typical for a Tim Burton production. Johnny Depp was pretty much as can be expected which is a good thing if you like Johnny Depp. 
The return of Barnabas to his, now rather dysfunctional, family is rather funny. The ease with how Barnabas was duped and trapped again in the second half of the film was a bit annoying but then, he had been asleep for a few centuries.

On coastal Maine, a Vampire named Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is released in 1972 after almost 200 years in captivity and reacquaints himself with his family’s chateau & the nearby fishing village. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the Collins matriarch, Helena Bonham Carter the in-house shrink, Eva Green a conniving witch, Bella Heathcote the reincarnation of Barnabas’ long-lost love and Chloë Grace Moretz a 15 year-old punk.

Directed by Tim Burton, “Dark Shadows” (2012) isn’t far removed in tone from his “Sleepy Hollow” (1999), which also featured Depp as the protagonist, although I suppose “Shadows” throws in a little more humor. I’ve never seen the TV soap opera Dark Shadows or the subsequent two movies, so I can’t compare this movie to them. All I know is that I liked this rendition quite a bit, just as I liked the inexplicably reviled “The Lone Ranger” (2013).

The October/November ambiance (i.e. Halloween-season) is to die for and Depp as Barnabas Collins maintains your interest throughout. He’s obviously a fish-out-of-water in 1972, but acclimates pretty quickly. Eva Green is perfect as the ee-vil witch and Carter is enjoyable as usual. I don’t get the hubbub over Moretz, but she’s a’right (and holds a surprise for the last act). Alice Cooper is featured in a glorified cameo. I should add that the opening credits sequence with “Nights in White Satin” is cinema at its finest.

The movie runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and was shot in England (Devon, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Cornwall &  Farnham) and Scotland (Mull, Argyll and Bute) with exteriors of the chateau shot at Trafalgar Castle School, Whitby, Ontario, Canada.

Don't get me wrong, this is probably a stranger than good watch, but from concept to story to characters, it has a lot of good to it.  Some of the choices are a bit odd, but they do create their own problem-solution story arcs that make it feel like this was a comic book that was consolidated into a movie.

While Depp's typical weirdness is abundant, each character has their own weirdness about them, and the otherworldly atmosphere of the movie is what makes it.

Eva Green does steals the show whenever she makes an appearance, and her character is a force of power, and it shows.

Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the makers here basically stick safe to the formula of the series. This time it's a space station with space pirates and a cloned Ripley (Siggy Weaver of course) - yes! A cloned Ripley, only this time she's devoid of human compassion - kind of... The gore quota is significantly upped, which makes for some serious sci-fi terror, and some of the imagery crafted is outstanding (a clone lab sequence is shatteringly unforgettable). A tip top cast featuring Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Brad Dourif, Dan Hedaya and Winona Ryder, all give good shows, whilst the photography (Darius Khondji/Se7en) and art design (Steve Cooper, Andrew Neskoromny and John M.

8078,Wuchak,"_**A combo of the first three with a couple fresh ideas**_

Two hundred years after Ripley’s death in the previous film (Sigourney Weaver), she wakes up as a clone in a space station, which also serves as a colossal vessel. Scientists there are experimenting with xenomorph/human eugenics to create, I guess, the ultimate living weapon. Meanwhile a ship of smugglers visits the station when (big surprise) the aliens escape captivity.  Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman play space pirates while Dominique Pinon and Michael Wincott are leaders at the station. Brad Dourif is on hand as a scientist.

""Alien Resurrection"" (1997) is the fourth film in the series and combines elements of the previous three while throwing in a couple of new things. The diverse cast is great but I started to get bored by the end of the first act. Thankfully, the movie perks up with an outstanding underwater sequence that recalls “The Poseidon Adventure” (1972), albeit more amped up.

The peripheral cast is highlighted by the voluptuous Kim Flowers as Hillard and the formidable Gary Dourdan as Christie. But you just know they’re the equivalent of red shirts in Star Trek.

If you’ve seen the first three entries, there’s no pressing reason to see this one. It has a been-there-done-that vibe. However, if you appreciate those films and want more of the same with a new cast, “Alien Resurrection” is well done for what it is, proficient sci-fi/horror. Armchair critics have been too hard on it. While it lacks the mystery of the first movie and the suspense & utter horror of the second, it has more pizazz than the relatively subdued third installment.

Well, luckily for all concerned, technology roars ahead and 200 years afterwards we have somehow managed to clone her - and her baby. Military plans for the killer beasties are the reason, but as we all know by now - nature finds a way, and after some dodgy DNA sequencing, they face an enemy that presents a terrifying hybrid of alien and human that could threaten Earth itself. It is up to her, whom the aliens still think is one of then, and a disparate bunch of space pirates to try to thwart the creatures - and to survive! This offers quite a shocking indictment of just how state-sponsored science, coupled with militaristic aspirations can lead to some hideous creations but aside from that rather obvious moral imperative, the rest of this is pretty routine. There is no shock left for us to feel; we have seen it all before and just like last time, the folks getting gobbled up are largely deserving of their fates.

8078,GenerationofSwine,"I can't believe how the Alien franchise has been politicized in two directions by the same side of the political debate.

I pointed out Ripley as an example of a strong female lead that everyone loves, and that got me the ire of the cancel culture folks. It's not politically correct to like Ripley when you have worse and more modern strong female leads.

But, I really didn't like ""Alien: Resurrection"" and that earned me the wrath of the exact same people!!!!

So, I guess the basic rule of thumb is that you are only supposed to like the bad movies to be politically correct?

I don't know how it works.

For those of you that are rational, ""Alien: Resurrection"" stinks. For starters, Ripley is supposed to be dead. Bringing her back the way they did, well, that's not only an insult to us fans that love her, but to Ripley as well.

Seeing her like that left a sour taste in my mouth.

And though I always loved and will likely always love both Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman, and though they did as good of a job as they could...they couldnt act their way around a horrible script and a terrible premise.

You can't blame the actors for this nightmare. You can see that they are actually trying to salvage something from the mess. In the end, you have to blame it on the fact that this is an Alien movie that no one asked for, and it's a plot that should never have been.

8078,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**Despite some merits and the effort of the director and cast, it is the weakest of the Alien films.**

This was the fourth film in the Alien franchise, and the last one for many years. The franchise started well and developed nicely into three films that, while not without criticism or problems, work really well and have a lot of coherence as a joint work. The fourth film, unfortunately, completely breaks with this coherent and harmonious union.

Jean Pierre Jeunet has done a pleasant and undoubtedly strong job. It is one of the films that made the director's career and that we remember when we talk about him. And there is no doubt that he managed to prevent this film from being even worse, putting great effort into his work, coordinating his technical team and guiding a strong and highly competent cast.

Sigourney Weaver is back with the character that launched her career, despite the very understandable reluctance to accept the project (after all, Ellen Ripley had died in the immediately preceding film). She herself stated, without any fuss, that she agreed to do the film because she was handsomely paid. I don't blame her. For an actor, who lives off the jobs he's called to, and who never quite knows when they'll appear, it's important to accept lucrative opportunities. And we have to be honest, the actress committed herself to the work and did everything to give us a performance at the same level as we have seen in previous films. However, she unfortunately did not have been material with the same quality. Winona Ryder, who was experiencing a particularly happy period in her career, is also here, and she also gives us a very reasonable job, although far from matching the great performances she achieved in other films of the same period. Ron Perlman, fairly unknown, is in good shape, as is Brad Dourif.

On a technical level, the film is frankly inferior to its predecessors, and considering that all this is a set that should be cohesive and homogeneous, it is difficult not to make some comparisons. It's a film that continues to rest solidly on very strong visual and special effects, which are very reasonably done considering the age of the film and what has gone before it. It's not as spectacular as its predecessors, and any originality has been lost, but it's not bad, and it's worth seeing. Unfortunately, for a horror film with monsters on the loose, the action scenes are sparse, and seem very weak copies of what was done in the other films (to give an example, this film also has an alien sucked through a hole, in a very similar way to what happened in the first film). The tension and suspense are still present, and it's a truly unnerving film, which can be unsettling for some people. However, the really effective scares are few, even if it is a more visual and bloody film than its predecessors. An excellent cinematography helps to set this all up reasonably well.

Between merits and demerits, what really has no salvation is the script. The story we see in this film, in my opinion, not only has a very poor articulation with the films that preceded it, but actually ends up contradicting them. All it takes is to bring back to life, through a rather lame artifice, a character we saw to die with dignity. If this film needed Ellen Ripley – and indeed it needed, she was the character who gave the previous films its strength – the most logical thing was not to make a sequel, but a prequel or a spin-off with a story that was credible and logical, considering what was already done.",2023-05-25T19:34:12.160Z,5.0,Alien: Resurrection,1997
13567,tmdb17996075,"If there's a slasher flick that came out during the slasher fever that took place in the 80s, that succeeded in not becoming another carbon copy of ""Friday the 13th"", that would be ""Sleepaway Camp"". The movie offers all the elements featured in the average slasher formula... and then some. We have the campsite, the oblivious adults, the group of stereotyped kids, the mysterious killer lurking around the place, an opening flashback showing a horrible tragedy and a lot of dead bodies piling up. 

In ""Sleepaway Camp"", the story begins with a family that is struck by a horrible accident, in which the father and one of the children die. Little Angela, the sole survivor of the gruesome event, is sent to live with her bizarre aunt Martha and her protective and loving (albeit cranky) cousin, Ricky, who is about her age. 

Many years later, we see Angela and Ricky as teenagers, heading up to a campsite during the summer, much to the girl's dismay, whose (almost pathological) shyness makes it really difficult for her to socialize. As soon as they arrive, Angela becomes the target of all the cruel jokes and pranks one could imagine, which is something that doesn't sit too well with her hotheaded cousin, Ricky. As one may be able to assume, the mean adults and kids begin to suffer and die one by one, at the hands of a mysterious figure that lurks around the place (well, that's original). Could the small and frail Angela have something to do with all this? Is her cousin, Ricky, more protective than it appears to be? While the owner of the campsite tries to find out what the heck is going on (while endangering the kids, of course), the meanies continue to suffer gruesome deaths, until a final revelation leaves everyone shocked beyond belief. Yes, Angela was the one who murdered everyone, except... Angela is actually Peter, who was forced to live as a girl, because her Aunt Martha didn't want another boy in the family. Yikes!

Yes, the plot twist is genius and it left me completely stunned when I first saw this movie as a teenager, so I won't play down the final revelation because it was, in fact, one of the most iconic endings in a horror flick and for a good reason. Now, another reason why I found ""Sleepaway Camp"" to be so disturbing is because it provides a subtext in which the youngsters are hopeless victims in a world ran by miserable adults. Most of the adults in this movie appear to be sick, lascivious, greedy and even plain evil, always taking advantage of children and teenagers in order to achieve personal satisfaction or gains. The kids are seen as objects used by these corrupt and perverted adults, who are only interested in their own satisfaction. Intentionally or not, Robert Hiltzik, who both wrote and directed the film, gives us a really dark take on reality, by showing the way adults relate to children and teenagers, since the adult characters combined are probably more terrifying than the deranged individual behind the killings. As a matter of fact, this aspect of the film is somewhat depressing, as it is closer to reality than one would think and probably not something one expects to see in a slasher flick that, presumably, doesn't intend to give a message. This aspect of the story is plain sickening and it's one of the main reasons why ""Sleepaway Camp"" sort of stayed with me over the years and I find it so revolting. First of all, we have Aunt Martha (played by Desiree Gould), a woman who forces a young boy, who has recently lost his family, to change gender, just because... she already has a boy in the family and doesn't want another one! That's right, my friends, crazy Aunt Martha didn't hesitate to ruin a child's life, just because she thought it would be fun to have a girl in the family (perfectly normal, huh?). 
Then, we have Artie, the cook... ugh, this is perhaps one of the most disgusting supporting characters I have seen in a horror flick. Artie is a perverted man, presumably in his thirties, who lusts after kids and who doesn't even bother hiding his sickening proclivities among his peers. As a matter of fact, as soon as the kids arrive to the campsite, god-awful Artie reveals how he wants to get his hands on the poor and helpless kids and, when one of his co-workers try to talk some sense into him, by explaining him that the kids are too young to even understand about sex, Artie claims that “There is no such thing as being too young"". As if this wasn't disgusting enough, this revelation doesn't cause any outrage among the other adults who work at the campsite, who, as a matter of fact, laugh at what Artie says. As it is foreshadowed by Artie himself, he later tries to take advantage of our poor innocent Angela and when he is caught in the act before anything happens, he threatens Ricky. Of course, none of this would have been possible if it wasn't for the complicity of his co-workers who remain silent and even find him humorous. 
Another character that is nominated in the category of ""Rotten adults who deserve to be eaten alive by pigeons"" is Mel (played by Mike Kellin), the owner of the campsite. Mel is a greedy old bastard who, even though he soon realizes that the kids are in danger because there's a killer on the lose, refuses to send them home, because he doesn't want to lose money. This results in the death of many more kids, obviously (bullies, yes, but they didn't deserve such a gruesome fate, that's for sure). Of course, Mel not only gets people killed as a result of his own greediness; he also beats up a teenage boy, simply because he assumes that he is behind all the killings. Oh, he also smokes cigars next to the kids (but it was the 80s, so that may not be entirely his fault). Last, but not least, we have Meg... okay, Meg appears to be around 18, so she doesn't qualify as an adult entirely, but she's, in fact, one of the camp counselors, who abuses her so-called power to bully our poor Angie (oh, and she also sleeps with Mel, the previously mentioned greedy old bastard... yikes!). 

So, yes, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is a disturbing film, but the way I see it, Angela is one of the many elements that contribute to make it this way. In the end, one could argue that Angela is, to a certain extent, a victim as well (don't crap your pants, I'm not justifying her actions!).

Of course, this is a slasher from the 80s that was filmed with a very limited budget, so, even though the film mostly manages to stay on the ""serious"" side, the unintended hilarity finds a way to make an entrance. The campiness (no pun intended, but I love it, anyway) mostly comes from the over the top acting that, from time to time, feels more like a John Waters flick, rather than a serious horror flick. Besides this, some of the characters are so ridiculous and bizarre that, even during a serious and disturbing film, I found myself laughing. The scene where old Mel finds his teenage sweetheart's dead body is comedy gold... seriously, I dare you not to laugh at this ridiculous acting.

Over the last years, ""Sleepaway Camp"" has gotten some negative attention from certain people who accused the script of being trans-phobic, because it depicts an allegedly transgender individual as deranged, which is something that I strongly disagree with. First of all, Angela is not transsexual, because she is actually forced to live as a girl by her crazy aunt Martha, and it is not established that Peter ever showed signs of being a transgender child, so we could actually argue if Angela should be called Peter and treated as a male, instead. But, assuming for a second that Angela was, in fact, a male-to-female transgender individual, and her gender wasn't arbitrarily imposed by her aunt... why should we assume that her sexual condition had anything to do with the fact that she ended up being a deranged killer? Why can't we simply assume that she turns out to be a killer as a result of a very traumatic childhood and the fact that she was bullied during her entire life? 

Controversy aside, ""Sleepaway Camp"" is a film that became a cult classic for valid reasons and gave us one of the most memorable endings.",2019-01-06T17:04:01.552Z,8.0,Sleepaway Camp,1983

On the surface “Sleepaway Camp” (1983) is a clone of the first two “Friday the 13th” movies (1980/1981) mixed with elements of “Meatballs” (1979), but with more edge. Like the first “Friday the 13th,” the killer is a mystery until the end. Like “Meatballs,” the youths at the camp are adolescents, including pubescents. Kids of this ilk didn’t manifest in the Friday the 13th franchise until Part VI (1986) and, even then, they weren’t the focus.

Unfortunately, the production values are subpar compared to the above films. If you take out the cussing and slayings, this is of the TV movie variety; and I’m being nice. There’s also some overt camp (no pun intended), like Ricky’s mother. 

Still, you can’t beat the early 80’s ambiance and the styles are amusing, especially the short shorts worn by guys. Unlike most of the “Friday” flicks or “The Burning” (1981), the killer doesn’t wear a mask; and “Sleepaway Camp” gets extra points for a shockingly perverse revelation at the climax. There are several other gems, like Judy’s full black mane (Karen Fields), Meg’s curious attraction to the older curmudgeonly camp owner and Paul DeAngelo’s impressive fitness & laughable shorts. 

The film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes; and was shot in in Argyle, New York, near Summit Lake at a camp formerly named Camp Algonquin.

Sleepaway Camp is an American independent horror movie from filmmaker, Robert Hiltzik. Who wrote, directed, and produced the film. It introduces a very young Felissa Rose as Angela Baker. Alongside local actors Jonathan Tiersten, Karen Fields, and Christopher Collet. We even have a rare appearance from Robert Earl Jones, brother to James Earl Jones. And this movie marked the final film role for Mike Kellin as he would die of lung cancer in August of ‘83. It was released to US theaters on November 18th, 1983 and became a surprise hit.

Angela Baker and her cousin Ricky attend summer camp at Camp Arawak. Ricky had been coming for a while, but this was Angela's first time. Needless to say, it doesn't go very well. The camp is full of creeps, assholes and jerk-bags. And someone is running around trying to kill them all! This really doesn't help things for young Angela who just wants to be left alone.

Today we are looking at an iconic horror movie, Sleepaway Camp. A film that definitely made a mark and has an ending scene that will be burned into your memory for years to come. It's quintessential, in that it captures the time in style and fashion. It encompasses that summer camp feeling better than a lot of the other flicks in the same setting. Hell, it captures camp better than most Friday the 13th movies that are set at Camp Crystal Lake. This isn't afraid to go places other films fear to tread. It explores all sorts of themes from gender-roles to child molestation, while simultaneously injecting some entertaining camp comedy. The characters are all exaggerations with long strokes of realism. The dialogue can be hokey at some points but realistic at others. The fighting and bickering between campers is great. I’ve always felt that kids cursing really hit a stride during the mid-seventies through the eighties. And the language in this movie is on another level. I am all on-board for it.

Sleepaway Camp is an original and well-crafted slasher. Everyone that dies is very unlikeable and deserves what they get. The pedophile cook was my favorite. He's a real piece of shit that gets his comeuppance in such a satisfying fashion. And it's true that the ending is a finale that you will never forget. Believe that. Sleepaway Camp isn't going to be for everyone. It's going to be highly offensive to just about any parent or puritan. However, it has a lot of great qualities that make the film stand out far ahead of the competition. It fits into horror marathons perfectly and is a usual fixture during Halloween parties.

Two members of a corn-farming family in 1922 Nebraska commit a crime and get away with it, but do they really? Thomas Jane and Molly Parker play the parents while Dylan Schmid is on hand as the son, who’s about 15.

Released in 2017, “1922” is a haunting crime drama/period piece with elements of horror, unsurprisingly based on a Stephen King story of the same name. The confined farm location, tone and even genre are akin to films like “The Messengers” (2007), “Husk” (2011) and “Signs” (2002). There’s also a nod to “Bonnie and Clyde” (1967).

Thomas Jane should’ve gotten an award for his performance, as he literally disappears in the role and is unrecognizable. His farm hick accent is so thick I strongly recommend using the subtitles.

The themes revolve around disloyalty, the danger of allowing hostility (hatred) to fester, the abuse of authority/manipulation and the power of conscience.

The film runs 1 hour, 42 minutes and was shot, believe it or not, in Western Australia. Additional cast: Kaitlyn Bernard appears as the kid’s neighbor girlfriend and Neal McDonough her father.

452507,CinemaSerf,"This isn't so much a movie, as a stark - almost biblical - lesson on the reap and ye shall sow principle. Thomas Jane is unhappily married to Molly Parker. When she decides it is time to sell up their small ranch (complete with fields of tall corn!), he hits on the idea of disposing of her. He ropes in his 14 year old son Dylan Schmid and what follows is a rather beautifully shot story of retribution (divine or man-made) on the pair. This is more of a cross-thread of what happens to the two men dealing with the consequences, than a story with a narrative, and that is where the film really slows down to a rather ponderous grind. It was only ever a short-ish story from Stephen King so it was always going to be tough to properly string it out for 100 minutes and though atmospheric, it is really just a rather procedural plod of a film with little about the two men to engage sympathy. At times the imagery is graphic, but not in an especially potent way, and the dialogue seems to take for ever to make the point we have long guessed for ourselves much earlier.

49017,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"That the so called “critics” at Rotten Tomatoes screws this movie over is not really a surprise. Said “critics” are usually out of sync with both my opinions and the opinions of most of the viewers which can be seen again from the fact that these people give this movie a 23% rating whereas the actual viewers give it a 60% rating. At lot of “purists” also seem to take a disliking to this movie. Well, the movie is named Dracula Untold so it should be no surprise that the story would be a new one.

Personally I found this movie quite enjoyable. Yes it is not the original Dracula story but it is not straying too far from the basic origins and it is really a quite decent story unlike some of the disastrous Hollywood rewrites. The original story claims that Dracula became a vampire during his battles with the Turks and this movie picks up on that and tells the story of how that happened. Unlike most (all?) Dracula movies, Dracula is not really the bad guy but rather the inverse and the movie tells a story about sacrifices and Dracula’s quest to keep some of his humanity, moral and sanity.

It would not be a Dracula movie without some blood flowing and this movie delivers without overdoing it. Actually the actual bloodsucking stuff is quite played down until the end of the movie. There are a fair amount of fights against the Turks (who are the real bad guys in this movie) though and blood as well as various body parts no longer attached to their proper places does float around quite a bit. The special effects are not forgotten and I quite liked the bat swarms that Dracula commanded during the final fights against the Turks.

I found Luke Evans performance as the prince and unwilling Dracula to be quite good. The rest of the characters were also well played. I am sure that none of them will be nominated for Oscars due to their part in this movie but I have nothing negative to say about their performance.

On the whole I found this movie quite enjoyable and I definitely disagree with all the people blasting it.

49017,Wuchak,"Dracula: The dark Superman

RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by Gary Shore, ""Dracula Untold” tells the origin of Dracula: In the 15th century Prince Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans) must protect his small kingdom of Wallachia (in modern-day Romania) from a Turk warlord (Dominic Cooper) who demands a thousand boys from Wallachia & Transylvania, including Vlad’s son. Threatened by the unsurmountable Turk army, Vlad desperately makes a dubious pact with a formidable caged vampire in order to acquire its dark powers and save his family & kingdom. Sarah Gadon plays Vlad’s winsome wife. 

The producers flirted with the idea of “Dracula Untold” being part of Universal’s Dark Universe; and the epilogue of the movie, set in the modern world, suggests this, insinuating a franchise. This idea was dropped, however, and “The Mummy” (2017) became the first official film in the Dark Universe. In any case, “Dracula Untold” was fairly successful at the Box Office, making $56.3 million in North America and $217.1 million worldwide against a cost of $70 million.

My title blurb pretty much tells you all you need to know: “Dracula Untold” is basically the dark Superman of 15th century Eastern Europe where Dracula wields the power to defeat a thousand-man army. If you like the great prologue to Coppola’s “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992), you’ll probably like this movie, which gives several nods to that forerunner. 

The film LOOKS awesome and has a fine cast. But unlike “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” it’s rapidly paced and doesn’t leave much room to breathe; so the characterizations aren’t quite deep enough. It’s good, but somehow hollow and forgettable. “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” was perhaps a little too slow while “Dracula Untold” is too hurried. I wish the creators found the happy medium between the two because, with just a little bit more time and attention to detail, it could’ve been great.

49017,tmdb28039023,"Bram Stoker's Count Dracula is textbook example of my Evil Iceberg Theory (the less you see of and know about a villain, the better). In an epistolary novel, the title character is the only one who doesn’t set his thoughts down in letters or in a diary (or, like Dr. Seward, a phonograph recording). 

If, as Lovecraft wrote, ""The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown,"" then Dracula is the embodiment of this fear; inscrutable, unknowable, unreachable, impossible to negotiate or reason with. 

Moreover, it’s futile to try to assign him complex motivation; like the shark in Jaws or Dr. Lecter, the Count kills to feed — no more, no less. Taking all this into account, it's easy to see how bad an idea Dracula Untold really is.

The story is narrated — a long time after it took place, though oddly in the same childlike voice the narrator had when the events trasnspired — by Ingeras (Art Parkinson), son of Vlad III Draculea, aka the Impaler, aka Son of the Dragon, aka Son of the Devil, aka Dracula; let's just call him Vlad (Luke Evans). 

""In the year of our Lord 1442, the Turkish sultan enslaved 1,000 children from Transylvania to fill the ranks of his army."" One of these children grew up to become Vlad, who ""disgusted by his monstrous deeds ... buried his past with the dead and returned to Transylvania to rule in peace."" So Vlad just took his ball and went home. Just like that, no revolt required. Someone should tell the Sultan how slavery really works.

This notwithstanding, Wallachia and Transylvania remain under Ottoman rule, and Vlad must pay an annual tribute to Sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper); one can't help wondering why these two peoples are so hostile to each other, especially seeing how they share the lingua franca of British English. 

Mehmed takes it upon himself to 'enslaving' a thousand other children (perhaps the first thousand just walked away like Vlad?), including Ingeras. Vlad refuses, and knowing that this means war, goes to a cave in a mountain to seek help from ""a vampire. From the Greek word pi, to drink [actually 'pi' is a Greek letter; the language in which it is a word that means 'drink' or 'suck' is Albanian]. The beast was once a mortal man who summoned a demon from the depths of hell to barter for his dark power. The demon deceived the man, granting his wish, but his price was an eternity condemned to the darkness of that cave, where he remains until he finds another to free him.""

The cave vampire (Charles Dance), who once was a Roman and thus speaks, like all Romans do in the movies, the Queen's English, gives Vlad a sip of his blood, and with it “a taste of my power. The strength of 100 men. The speed of a shooting star. Domain of the night and all its creatures. See and hear through your senses. Even heal grievous wounds ... Once you drink, your thirst for human blood will be insatiable. But if you can hold out for three days, you will return to your mortal state having tasted my power, and perhaps saved your people. [What if I feed?] I will be freed having granted the darkness a worthy offering. You will become … like me. A scourge on this earth destined to destroy everything you love… I, however, will be free to unleash my wrath against the one who betrayed me. And one day, I will call upon you to serve me, my pawn, in an immortal game of revenge.""

All this does is show that sometimes no explanation is the best explanation. Let's compare Coppola’s Dracula, in whose introduction — featuring modern Romanian dialogue with medieval English syntax (perhaps not historically correct but still much better than English-English) — Gary Oldman plunges his sword into the stone cross of a chapel, and drinks the blood that flows from it. 

This doesn't necessarily make any more sense, but at least it's short and to the point, and Coppola has the good sense to not even try to explain it. 

Conversely, all of Dracula Untold’s heavy exposition only raises more questions than it answers. How did this Roman guy end up in Transylvania? Are there no caves in Rome? Why can't he leave the cave and Vlad can? What exactly does ""an immortal game of revenge"" mean? This phrase simply reeks of oxymoron.

Speaking of Coppola, he was the second to make the character of Dracula and the historical Dracula one and the same person, and add a Reincarnation Romance to the plot (the first was Dan Curtis in his own 1974 Bram Stoker's Dracula, written by Richard Matheson). 

Director Gary Shore and screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless repeat the formula in Dracula Untold, but their mistake is making an entire movie out of this premise. If they had done their homework, they would know that the link to Vlad III is tenuous at best, and that the real and probably only reason Stoker used the name 'Dracula' is because he was under the mistaken impression that it meant 'devil' in Romanian (but who knows; maybe the confusion of ' Greek pi' with Albanian 'pi' was a tribute to this linguistic faux pas on the Irish author’s part).",2022-09-15T22:52:17.775Z,1.0,Dracula Untold,2014
49017,CinemaSerf,"I think you have to treat this depiction of Dracula on it's own merits. There is no point comparing it with anything you've seen already. Given that, it is a perfectly watchable, and forgettable, adventure film with Luke Evans as Prince Vlad making the vampiric equivalent of a ""deal with the devil"" with Charles Dance to prevent his family and his kingdom from being over-run by the Turks. Dominic Cooper is really terrible as the Ottoman Sultan, though - his accent sounds like it's been finessed in his local kebab shop after too many tequila slammers on a Friday night. Evans is fine in the role, there is plenty of action and the visual effects are adequate too.

But the grim reaper is not impressed and he's coming to claim the deaths of all those who should have died in the crash.

For a sequel to truly work well it has to come up with something fresh, otherwise why do a sequel eh? Well the makers of Final Destination 2 choose to use the basic same formula of the hugely enjoyable first film, only adding more black humour into the crazy death design broth. Opening with a quite horrific highway pile up, FD 2 then takes us on a journey that sees an assortment of folk offed in various and gruesome ways. The story remains the same as the first film, even though writers Bress and Gruber think they are being intricate by weaving this plot into the original story, but ultimately it's just a devilishly nonsense fun picture. Ali Larter returns for a second helping, and she in turn is joined by a bunch of no mark actors waiting for death, which is perfectly fine for the genre discerning fan.

9358,Wuchak,"***Solid sequel, maybe a notch better than the first film***

The first ""Final Destination"" movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper, as an invisible spiritual presence. A group of people, mostly youths, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually involving an unlikely chain reaction. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash; in this second film from 2003 it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.

There are currently five films in the franchise and they all tell the same basic story with different characters and some nuances; they’re all of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same, although the fifth film throws in an interesting new twist (Death’s victim can find a substitute).

Ali Larter returns as a secondary protagonist while A.J. Cook takes the reigns of the 'final girl.’ Keegan Connor Tracy also has a considerable role in the female department while Sarah Carter has a smaller part. While this is a quality assortment of women, the creators coulda done more with them. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum Michael Landes stars as a state trooper. Jonathan Cherry, Terrence 'T.C.' Carson and James Kirk are also on hand. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his second of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.

I actually like this one a little better than the first one, but like that film, the second half isn’t as strong as the first. Is the final scene supposed to be horrific? Cuz it made me bust out laughing.

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area, including Campbell River (although the events take place around New York City).

9358,RalphRahal,"""Final Destination 2"" sticks to the same formula as the first one, keeping the eerie atmosphere and inevitable doom at the center of its plot. The story kicks off with a massive, well-executed crash sequence that sets the stage for another round of fate playing its twisted game. While the concept remains engaging, the script doesn't dive deeper into the lore, missing an opportunity to expand on what made the original so intriguing. The directing keeps things moving at a solid pace, balancing tension with dark humor, and the cinematography does a good job of making the kills feel even more brutal with clever framing and effects.

The acting is decent, nothing outstanding, but it gets the job done for a movie that relies more on suspense and creative death scenes than emotional depth. The editing is sharp, though there are a few continuity errors that eagle-eyed viewers might catch. The score is effective, enhancing the eerie mood and building tension where needed.

The cast are also downgrades, if nothing negative. A. J. Cook & Co. are perfectly fine in their respective roles, but it is missing a sturdy lead performer. Their characters are also weak, which obviously doesn't help the acting talent. The effects/creative deaths remain fairly good though.

It ends up creating some intrigue with the twist(s), though to be honest to me it felt too entwined. What doesn't help is that the cat is out the bag due to the original, it can't hit as much as you know the general gist of it all.

9373,tmdb76622195,"Producer Michael Bay steered this remake of the infamous 1970's horror flick, without bringing in anything new. When I first saw the trailer for this version of the story, I thought it looked a lot like a hurried sequel to the contemporary silly release ""Wrong Turn."" Five youths on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert pick up a young hitchhiker who commits suicide in the back of their van. Looking for help, and a little common sense, they stumble upon a weird family and their chainsaw wielding offspring. Much violence and such ensues.

While the first TCM was not perfect, I eventually learned to love the shaky camera, lousy sound, and cheap look. One reason that film worked for me was the fact that much of the horror took place in blinding daylight, the cast was hot and uncomfortable, and it showed. In this version, even with the original's director of photography, most of the shots are too calculated. The horrors in the dark are not all that horrifying. This might be the rantings of a jaded horror film fan, but I never got the same feeling of unease as I did in the first film. Much of the original's story has been changed as film makers tried to keep the audience guessing by not doing a shot by shot remake, like Gus Van Sant's ""Psycho."" The absolute lunacy of the first film's family was strange enough, here the members are more dimwitted than scary. This lessens the impact of Leatherface's scenes. You know he is the worst it can get, you don't have an equally sick family to fall back on. One disappointing scene involves the heroine Erin (Jessica Biel) running to a trailer and meeting two women who will obviously not help her. Instead of being a tense moment, where mind games involving drinking a seemingly harmless cup of tea could be played out, the women are there for nothing more than exposition, blaming Leatherface's penchant to kill on being teased when he was younger for a degenerative skin disease. The five victims all meld together, Nispel's direction is okay, but the cinematography is too nice for this type of horror film. The black and white scratchy scenes recall TV's ""Millennium"" or ""The Blair Witch Project."" If I would compare ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to anything, it would be the terrible sequels that came out after the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to that point. Just one was watchable, ""Leatherface,"" but with the exception of Part 2, they were all simply remakes of the original film. Most direct to video sequels do that now, and while this film tries to be something different, it is simply a remake that cannot match the original.

For slasher fans, there is a lot of fun here, and the bodies hit the floor all over in a spectacular fashion.

Really trying not to spoil anything, I can only point to a handful of features where there are multiple survival situations in play at once.  Its a special kind of intensity that obscures what's going to happen next.

417384,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

This might be the very first film of 2019, which I knew absolutely nothing about going into the theater. Usually, I avoid trailers for most movies, but it’s almost impossible to not catch an image or a clip here and there. However, for Scary Stories, since it wasn’t heavily marketed in my country (at least), the only things I knew was that Guillermo del Toro was involved and that it was a horror flick. Knowing del Toro, I also remembered myself that this wouldn’t just be a straightforward horror story, filled with predictable jump scares, and a bland narrative. That’s my first advice to my fellow readers: if you expect a film similar to those of The Conjuring Universe, then you’ll be disappointed.

It’s also not the other extreme. It doesn’t follow the ambiguity and weirdness of Jordan Peele’s installments, so if you’re one of those people that don’t appreciate that type of horror, you’re safe as well. Having in mind the latest movies released from the genre, it’s hard to find one that balances these two separate takes instead of choosing one of them. Scary Stories spends its first half slow-building their characters, but mainly its story. There’s a massive build-up to something that’s pretty much the premise of the film, so it struggles to reach the actual “action” without it becoming a tad boring or too long. It’s a “breath of fresh air” (in the genre, I mean) to have a good set up, with decent character development, and an exponential interest in the main story, instead of jumping into silly horror sequences fifteen minutes after it started.

André Øvredal does an excellent job in directing. He really knows how to generate suspense and create a genuinely creepy build-up. There’s tremendous camera work involved in some fantastic sequences that don’t rely on jump scares to provide the “fear” factor. It’s the never-ending suspense, that feeling of claustrophobia even if the character isn’t in a confined space. Except for one scene, we can always see what’s happening. The “monsters” don’t appear out of nowhere, they don’t screech at you precisely at the third time a character looks another way, and the actual jump scares are rather efficient. However, they’re not scary, as well as the movie itself…

It’s not simply a scary film. It doesn’t have that heavy and dark tone that we feel in other horror movies. At first, I thought it might be a bad thing, but Scary Stories establishes this distinct tone from the very beginning. Even without knowing a single thing about the film, I understood from the first few minutes that it was going to be “different”. I would advise caution to not judge this movie by its trailers if they indicate that this is one of those films to make you scream every five minutes. There’s definitely a message to be transmitted, and I think it was well-delivered in the ending. It might be too cheesy for some or lack impact for a movie that asks the audience for a bit of patience, but for me, it worked well enough.

The acting is mostly good. Zoe Colletti (Stella) and Michael Garza (Ramon) are undoubtedly the standouts, and they do a good job of carrying the narrative forward. They both have compelling backstories, but for the time that the film spends developing its characters, I wish they went more in-depth with Stella. She has a particularly intriguing past, and I don’t think we get enough out of it. Gabriel Rush (Auggie) and Austin Zajur (Chuck) have great chemistry, but their comic-relief roles are a disservice to an otherwise pretty solid movie.

Technically, there are some beautiful shots from the DP, Roman Osin. Usually, sequences at night in low-budget films suffer a lot with lack of clear visibility, but Osin does a remarkable job, playing with lighting in a truly unique way. I’m curious to know what audiences will think of this movie. If I had to bet, I think people will leave disappointed due to the lack of more generic jump scares, and a straightforward narrative. Truth be told, the slow pacing doesn’t help, especially when the character development only works for two. Finally, the “scary stories” that Sarah tells are entertaining and imaginative, and the whole concept of this film is incredibly captivating.

All in all, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a distinct horror flick, with well-developed leads, and a creative approach to an unique premise. It doesn’t follow the rules of generic horror, by not relying itself too much on jump scares, and making the actual story and characters the main interest. Beautifully-produced by Guillermo del Toro and co. as well as brilliantly directed by André Øvredal. The “scary stories” are indeed dark and creepy, providing a whole second-half of excellent horror scenes. 

However, the first-half takes its time to set everything up, and the lack of more “action” might leave some viewers disappointed. Only two characters are genuinely engaging, which proves that the slow build-up didn’t entirely pay off as it should have. It’s meant to be a divisive movie, but I definitely recommend seeing it!

417384,Martha,I had high expectations for this movie. The books means so much to me. I found them when I was a lonely kid in School who was picked on and what day went to the library and found a book called scary stories to tell in the dark. I fell in love with the stories due to my Macabre nature. I've always held all three books in the series close to my heart. However this movie didn't really bring what the books bring which is a sentence of sheer terror. I felt like there weren't enough scary moments. There wasn't enough short stories. It felt like we were focused on the one girl's story and her tacked on love interest. I did love the few scary moments it did have and the one gross one with the big toe. I just felt like it needed more and could have done more. It's not a horrible movie it just feels like it's not finished and like it wasn't enough.,2022-07-26T09:02:05.432Z,6.0,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2019

>_This was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories. This was no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our astronomers measure or deem too vast to measure. It was just a colour out of space – a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyes._

- H.P. Lovecraft; ""The Colour Out of Space""; _Amazing Stories_ (September, 1927)

Much of the work of H.P. Lovecraft takes place in a vast shared universe, which would, by its very nature, seem to lend itself to the current vogue for cinematic long-form narratives. However, considering the size of his _oeuvre_, very little of it has been adapted for the screen, and Lovecraft in general has proved a difficult author to film (although Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna would probably beg to differ). And so we have _Colour Out of Space_, written and directed by Richard Stanley (his first film in 25 years, after he was famously fired three days into the disastrous shoot of his long-gestating dream project, _The Island of Dr. Moreau_). A modernisation but otherwise surprisingly faithful adaptation of Lovecraft's 1927 short story ""The Colour Out of Space"", _Colour_ takes a good stab at depicting one of Lovecraft's most oblique entities (essentially it exists as an indescribable colour). Mixing humour and body horror (perhaps weighed a little too much towards humour), the film gives Nicholas Cage another opportunity to go full-Cage after he recently cut loose in Brian Taylor's _Mom and Dad_ (2017) and Panos Cosmatos's _Mandy_ (2018). And boy does he lean into it – this is the most ludicrous, histrionic, and borderline farcical performance he's given since Robert Bierman's _Vampire's Kiss_ (1989), screaming about the importance of alpacas one minute (they're ""_the animal of the future_""), calmly playing the dutiful father the next. And how you respond to this will largely dictate how you respond to the film – ridiculously camp, over the top, and vapid or ridiculously camp, over the top, and darkly compelling.

Just outside the city of Arkham, MA (the fictitious setting of many Lovecraftian stories), Nathan Gardner (Cage), and his wife Theresa (Joely Richardson), teenage children Benny (Brendan Meyer) and Lavinia (Madeleine Arthur), and young son Jack (Julian Hilliard) have moved into Nathan's deceased father's property. Theresa has recently been given the all-clear after battling breast cancer, and is gradually returning to work as a commodities trader, working from home via the internet (albeit with an unreliable connection). Lavinia, a practising Wiccan, spends her time riding the family horse and performing rituals she hopes will keep her mother cancer-free. Nathan, for his part, has embraced rural life by raising alpacas on the property's farm. As the film begins, hydrologist Ward (Eliot Knight) arrives in the area to survey the water table. That night, the sky fills with pulsating light and a rock crashes onto the Gardners' land. The following day, Ward says it's probably just a meteorite, although Ezra (Tommy Chong, essentially playing himself), an ageing hippie who lives in the forest completely off the grid, believes it's a sign that something has gone wrong with the natural order of things. As time passes, the Gardners start to experience ever-more bizarre events – unnaturally localised lightning storms that seem to come from nowhere; huge fuchsia-like plants that seem to grow overnight; a horrific odour coming from the meteorite that only Nathan can smell; a gigantic purple mantis flying around; radios and the internet cutting out more than normal; the water turning strange colours; the meteorite itself mysteriously turning to dust; the family's dog, Lavinia's horse, and Nathan's alpacas starting to acting strangely; the family's produce (such as tomatoes) growing at exponential speeds; even time itself appears to be corrupted. Soon enough, the family members begin to show signs of change – Jack starts talking to someone in the well; Nathan discovers his arm is developing scales; Theresa accidentally cuts off two of her fingers and barely notices; Benny goes in and out of fugues, Lavinia becomes violently nauseous. And as the whole family finds itself in mortal danger, are any of them unaffected to the point where they're capable of saving the others?

The original ""The Colour out of Space"" tells the story of a surveyor from Boston who learns a meteorite crashed just outside Arkham several years previously in an area now known as the ""Blasted Heath"", apparently poisoning everything and causing anybody with whom it came into contact to go insane. Hoping to get more specific information, the unnamed surveyor seeks out Ammi Pierce, a hermit living in the nearby woods, who tells him the story of Nahum Gardner, on whose property the meteorite landed. As it started to shrink, the meteorite left behind globules of a colour that fell outside the visible spectrum and could only be described by analogy. Over the following year, the Gardner family experience a series of increasingly devastating traumas before eventually turning on one another.

Lovecraft felt that the depiction of alien species in fiction was too familiar, too defined by the range of human comprehension, and he believed that if we were ever to encounter real cosmic beings, they could be so unlike anything in our experience as to be impossible to describe, or even process in our minds. One of his aims with ""Colour"" was to create an entity that didn't fulfil the rubric of conforming to human understanding – hence the only description is by analogy, and even then, it's described only in relation to colour. In fact, it's never even determined if the entity is conscious or not, at least not in the sense that humans recognise consciousness. It may be aware, but it's just as possible that it isn't, and the negative effects experienced by the Gardners aren't a sign of aggressiveness but simply the result of two vastly different existences interacting with one another. The story has been adapted for the screen four main times – Daniel Haller's _Die, Monster, Die!_ (1965), David Keith's _The Curse_ (1987), Ivan Zuccon's _Colour from the Dark_, and Huan Vu's rather enjoyable _Die farbe_ (2010), which is in black and white, except for the colours emitted by the meteorite.

This latest version opens with Ward speaking in a contemplative sub-Malick style voiceover that's fairly unnecessary, but which doesn't distract too much (it's only used a couple of times). After some basic introductory preamble to show us the family dynamic and establish important plot points such as Theresa's cancer, Lavinia's Wiccan rituals, Nathan and his alpacas, the film then features one of the most inorganic expositionary scenes I've ever seen, as Nathan and Theresa stand on the porch, admiring the woods and spend a good five minutes telling each other things that they both already know – the property used to belong to Nathan's father, Nathan is afraid of turning into his father, Nathan used to be a painter but hasn't worked in a while, Theresa is starting to get back into work, Lavinia and Benny are finding it hard to adapt to rural life, Jack not so much. It really is a ridiculous scene, to the point where it would have been no more on-the-nose to feature captions with character info.

Where Stanley is much more successful is in how he depicts the entity itself, or rather, how he doesn't. Obviously, by choosing to adapt this story, he knew he would have to give some kind of visual representation to something that exists, to human eyes at least, only as a colour beyond the visible spectrum. Lovecraft gets around this problem by way of analogy – the entity is never explicitly described other than by comparison – but this is not a technique available to a filmmaker. With this in mind, Stanley wisely keeps everything as vague as possible – vibrant, modulating pulses of light that seem to be emanating from somewhere just outside the frame, sounds originating from something just out of sight, vaguely-defined spatial distortions, colour manipulations with no obvious source, personality changes with no obvious reasoning behind them. It's rare you see such restraint in what is, ostensibly at least, a horror story, and Stanley is to be commended for it.

Important here is the actual colour itself. Again, in the novel, Lovecraft never says, for example, that the colour is ""mainly purple"", or words to that effect, because it isn't describable in those terms, and, once again, this poses a unique problem for a filmmaker – if something on-screen has a colour, then that colour has to be shown. However, instead of attempting to create an indescribable colour, director of photography Steve Annis (_Kissing Candice_; _I Am Mother_) chooses to go the route of not settling for any one stable colour – every time we see the effects of the meteorite, the hue appears to be in a state of flux, modulating through purple, magenta, mauve, fuchsia, lavender – so although we can say the colours are recognisable, they are never identifiable as any one specific colour, which, it has to be said, is probably the best choice the filmmakers could have made.

As we get into the third act, the film abandons all sense of restraint and goes completely batshit insane, with about five different things happening at any one moment, and the body horror which has threatened to break through from the earliest moments finally unleashed, foregrounding the exceptional work of special effects supervisor/creature designer Dan Martin (_The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)_; _ABCs of Death 2_; _High Rise_). These scenes are heavily indebted to David Cronenberg, especially his earlier work such as _Shivers_ (1975), _Rabid_ (1977), and _The Brood_ (1979), although the most obvious touchstone is Chris Walas's work on Cronenberg's masterpiece, _The Fly_ (1986), where it's not so much body horror, as body mincemeat. A lot of Martin's creature design seems inspired by the legendary work of Rob Bottin, and there's a direct visual quote of one of the best moments in John Carpenter's _The Thing_ (1982). Some of the more grotesque human-related effects also reminded me a little of Screaming Mad George's work on Brian Yuzna's _Society_ (1989), especially the orgy scene.

It's also in the last act where Cage is turned loose, signalled by an epic meltdown when he discovers Benny hasn't closed the barn door and the alpacas have gotten out. From there, it's Nicholas Cage unrestrained, figuratively amped up on amphetamines, cocaine, and coffee. There is a problem with this, however. Full-Cage has been seen in films such as _Vampire's Kiss_, John Woo's _Face/Off_ (1997), Werner Herzog's _Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call – New Orleans_ (2009), _Mom and Dad_, and _Mandy_, but each performance has felt fairly organic, never becoming self-conscious; each performance feels like a legitimate interpretation on the part of the actor, with the character feeling like a psychologically-real person, to one degree or another. In _Colour_, however, to an even greater extent than he did in Neil LaBute's virtually unwatchable _The Wicker Man_ (2006), Cage crosses into self-parody, with his performance having as much to do with people's preconceived notions of a Nicholas Cage performance as it does with finding the character. There are a couple of scenes here were he suddenly goes full-Cage out of nowhere, with very little narrative justification, only to revert to relative normality the next scene, and these alterations don't feel like organic character development, they feel like Cage winking at the audience. 

Which might be entertaining and all, but which serves neither the character nor the film especially well. For all its insanity, this is a relatively serious movie, but Cage's performance is so manically uneven and unpredictable, that it affects everything around it. Example – after the aforementioned meltdown (""_Don't you know how expensive those alpacas were_""), which just about fits in what we know of the character, as Nathan is walking away from Benny and Lavinia, he stops, turns, pauses, shouts, ""_ALPACAS_"", pauses again, and then walks away. This got a huge laugh at the screening I attended, and it was undoubtedly funny. But does self-reflexive humour by the leading man really serve the story well at this point? No, not in the slightest. In essence, this scene marks the point where the character ceases to be Nathan Gardner and becomes a version of Nicholas Cage. And this is driven home in the very next scene, where Cage once again portrays Gardner as a kind and caring father.

The other characters all have a kind of internal logic to their crumbling sanity; the meteorite affects each of them differently, with their minds disintegrating in different, but consistent ways. With Cage, however, it's there one minute, absent the next, and Stanley seems unwilling, or unable, to establish the parameters by which Nathan's mind is disintegrating, seemingly going for laughs rather than something more cogent.

This issue notwithstanding, I enjoyed _Colour Out of Space_ a great deal. Stanley's return to the director's chair is to be admired for its restraint and how faithful it remains to the very tricky Lovecraftian original. The body-horror in the film's last act will appeal to fans of the grotesque, whilst others will take great pleasure from Cage's insanity, as narratively unjustified as it is. The film is ridiculous on many levels, but it's extremely well realised and well made, and is to be applauded for not trying to attach an explicit meaning to a story which avoids any kind of thematic specificity.",2019-11-11T00:43:12.759Z,7.0,Color Out of Space,2019

It is very difficult to make a film adaptation of any H.P.Lovecraft short story. When an author aims to paint an image of the Unknown through poetic mastery it makes the task immensely difficult for any Director who refuses to alter the story itself. It was truly an incomprehensible mystery which ultimately ends and I wondered what was it that I had just watched? Then I realized I felt the same way when I read his short story years ago. I loved both.

It was intriguing, eerie, unpredictable and disturbing. Watch it for the art of the images as well as for the beauty behind the complexity of the writer who has a level of Linguistic Intelligence very few will ever understand. Including myself. Being able to make someone feel disturbed without using any violence or excess of violence is what I feel is pure Horror. Which is what H.P. Lovecraft believed and excelled at.

That being said the Director did an amazing work of art. It was beautiful to look at, the images were fantastic and it gets a solid 8.5/10 from me.

_Parental Advisory_: **16+**

This is not a film for children or even young teenagers. It has no violence however it displays gore and blood in several scenes to a 7/10 intensity at its peak. It can create a very eerie and edgy ambience throughout the second half that creeps up on you and before you know it you might feel very uncomfortable.

A giant meteorite crash lands into their garden and before long it seems to be exuding a menacing glow that is corrupting all it touches. ""Nathan"" (Nicolas Cage) and ""Theresa"" (Joely Richardson) are initially more perplexed than anything else, but gradually he starts to lose his grip on reality and what ensues becomes more dangerous for just about everyone as the alien entity encroaches with a clear desire to take over the place - if not the entire world. There are some fun moments in this, not least from the hammy Cage who just let's run with his character and from the young ""Jack"" (Julian Hilliard) who obsesses about his pal in the well whilst his mother carelessly amputates a few of her fingers! It looks ike it might be down to their ageing hippie neighbour ""Ezra"" (the scene stealing Tommy Chong) and to the visiting ""Ward"" (Elliot Knight) who seems to be able to keep a clear head - he also fancies the daughter, to rescue them from a fate worse than death. The visual effects are basic and rely heavily on colour, splodges of goo, and shotgun fire and there is maybe a little more comedy here than director Richard Stanley intended as the films starts to take the shape of a 1970s edition of ""Dr. Who"".

184346,Reno,"**An unusual team of two to fight the evil spirits!**

This was based on the real account. A cop from the New York who witnessed those unexplained events are what this film depicted for us. I think it is slightly an underrated film. Not because of true story, but from the entertainment perspective. From the beginning till the end, I enjoyed watching it. Horror means there's no big scary stuff in it, still being true to the genre, it told a decent story. It was well written and directed, a film that I almost missed, but now I can gladly suggest it to the others. But it is just an above average, yet worth a watch.

The story follows a cop who witnesses a series of strange events, which also influence his past. In the most of the case, he's trying to find one particular person, a painter seen in and around the city. So he and his partner finally find that strange man and when they do, it is already too late. One of them gets injured and the other one tries his best teaming up with a priest to fight the demon that terrorising the city. The film ends with an interesting event. Looks a sequel won't be a bad idea, since the duo is still fighting the devils as what the end statement reveals.

There's a recent television series I'm watching called 'Outcast' and this film is kind of resembles that. Anyway, this one came first, but what makes they both be alike is the unusual team up between two different field people. The series is like a follow-up of this film, or maybe inspired by this original story. Eric Bana is not everybody's favourite, but his films are quite enjoyable and for this, he had given his best. Co-stars are not bad either; particularly Edgar Ramirez was awesome as a priest. I hope you would find it interesting as I did. It would be beyond that for some, so all I say is watch it with a low expectations.

This particular movie felt like it wasn't about the journey, it was about the destination, and we essentially didn't get one.

Joel Edgerton is fantastic of course, but any one of the other actors could have been as well, we'll never know because they were never given that opportunity. Which really says it all with _It Comes at Night_. There seemed like there was something very worthwhile just on the other side of the veil, but we'll never know, because we never got to see it.

It was not what I was expecting, enjoyed it though. The trailer, the posters hints something else. So I thought it could be a horror, but it was even a terror or a thriller flick. Well, there were a few occasions where it was edgy, though in the most of the film nothing really happened. Slow but not boring. A simple storyline, limited cast and a apocalyptic theme. Surely you would have seen hundreds of this kind, so when you watch it, you won't find anything new out of it. Then remains the question, is it any worth!

I liked a simple take. Just like the film 'The Survivalist'. A small family living in an isolated place, but very precautious about any outside threat. The world is infected with an unknown disease and people are dying everywhere. Recently they had buried one of their family members. So they are not taking any chances with anyone. But now after a terrifying encounter, another family joins them and how things go on from there are the rest of the tale to tell us with a small twist.

Well, you won't see Joel Edgerton doing a solo film often. But this was a different, because of a small budget and the kind of narration. He did good and so the rest his co-stars. Firstly, it was not a horror film. Then there were a few intentional scenes to scare the viewers, but it wasn't anywhere near to scary. I've watched the whole film and I still don't know what comes at night. Dreams? Nightmares? Looks that's what it implies. Other than that it is a drama film with a little thrill. It can be watched nothing more than once.

Marketed as a horror creature movie, It Comes at Night disappoints due to the severe lack of creature horror. Instead, the film follows a family surviving an apocalyptic virus that has all but wiped humanity off the face of the earth. Paranoia saturates every moment of the movie, with characters constantly fearing how others might attack or infect those they care about. The film's scariest moments are the weird dreams the son keeps having. The twists at the end most likely are meant to shock but left me deflated.

418078,Nathan,"It Comes at Night is very realistic interpretation of a post-apocalyptic world which follows a family trying balance survival with their own morality.

I found almost every aspect of the story to be incredibly grounded; from the way the house is set up to the interactions between our main two families. The whole entire film the families are walking on eggshells trying not to disturb the peace that has settled for our main characters. No matter how long these two families have been in each other's company, they cannot truly trust each other in these desperate times. It creates a significant amount of tension as the audience is nervously waiting for the ultimate end to their harmony.

The cinematography and sound design are excellent in this film. The shots from inside the house feel incredibly claustrophobic and maze like, especially in the night scenes. The audio creates some truly terrifying moments as the muffled sounds of banging and rummaging echo through the halls. 

Our performances are all excellent. The extremely raw, pragmatic, and emotional mannerisms our characters display work so well with the dark and gritty reality of their world. Kelvin Harrison Jr. was a standout, his empathetic nature mixed with dark foreboding undertones was a very complex role that I think he nailed. Joel Edgerton was also great as always.

Overall, It Comes at Night is a great film and interpretation of what a real apocalyptic event would be due to the world and humanity that I really enjoyed despite its limited action.

Case 39 is directed by Christian Alvart and written by Ray Wright. It stars Renee Zellwegger, Jodelle Ferland, Ian McShane and Bradley Cooper. Music is by Michl Britsch and cinematography by Hagen Bodanski.

Another in the long line of demonic/psycho children films, Case 39 sat on the shelf for a few years before finally seeing the light of day around 2009. Met with a whole bunch of negative reviews it is somewhat pleasing to find that while it’s not a misunderstood classic or anything, it actually works well within this sub-genre of horror.

Story in short order form has Zellwegger as Emily Jenkins, a social worker who after rescuing young Lilly Sullivan from crazed parents, takes her in on a temporary foster basis and soon comes to regret it.

Offering up a more supernatural slant than many other films of a similar ilk, German director Alvart does still follow the familiar formula for crazed child movies. Lillith (unsubtle name or what?!) serenely ingratiates herself into Emily’s world and that of the people around her, then of course things start happening, bad things. Having taken his time to build it up during the first half, Alvart then revels in unleashing demonic chaos, with young Ferland giving an unnervingly superb performance as Lilly. The shocks and psychological torments are tidily crafted, and it all builds to a suitably daft and frenetic finale.

It’s too long at nearly two hours in length, it’s sometimes silly and it’s cliché heavy. However, some striking scenes, a mightily strong child performance and the decent chiller thriller fun factor, lifts this just above average status. 6/10",2014-07-03T00:02:13.430Z,6.0,Case 39,2009

But this is a horror theme, I mean real horror, not a terror-horror like 'Orphan'. The overall story relied on one big secret that revealed at some time in the final act.

I have seen many films about the child abuse, and this one set in as a same kind of theme, but takes a turn during the end of the first act. So when a social worker, Emily, finds a ten year old Lilith was abused by her own parents, she takes her away from them, followed by theirs arrest. Later, Emily adopts Lilith, but soon finds some strange events around her circle. That leads to suspect Lilith, but could not prove anything. Finding the truth becomes her first priority, but how she's going to solve it is what leads us to the conclusion part.

I haven't seen Renee Zellweger in any recent films, she looked so good in this. Jodelle Ferland too was good as a little girl, the most important role in the film. But Bradley Cooper was in a small part. I think it was a decent film, but not a fresh theme, except developed differently with a new cast. If you are a big horror film fan, you might disappoint with it. Because those parts were minimised and the suspense was maximised. Yet surely most of us can easily predict many scenes, event the ending. So I conclude my review saying it is a decent watch.

It is a decent horror film, but surely better than the first. The previous part was an usual teen themed horror where everything started as a playful. But this one was a prequel and it focused on the origins. A single mother with two daughters is making money helping the people who want to contact their beloved dead ones. The things changes when her little daughter started to communicate the spirits of her own. The chaos unleashes, the house becomes haunted and the family begins to fall apart.

Keeping it simple is what worked out well for the film, despite thematically borrowed from others, scenes were kind of familiar and characters intentionally developed. Particularly the priest role was the most overused in any horror film. Followed by the twist. That turning point was good, but not a new. Nice performances and well shot film. Ouija is a fine concept for a horror theme and with this film's somewhat success, I hope the next one would only get better. So it is worth a watch, if you're not anticipating a something special.

A sequel that's a prequel that's actually better than what preceded it! Ouija: Origin of Evil is an above average chiller that's a fine scary ride for those not expecting boundary pushing.

Standard rules apply here, widowed mum and two daughters who dabble in the con of seance profiteering get more than they bargained for when they introduce a Ouija board to proceedings.

Director Mike Flanagan knows how to construct a good honest scare piece (see Oculus and Hush), and so it proves here. The atmosphere is constantly set at impending dread, the tension slow built until pic goes into overdrive. Unfortunately so many horror films of the decade are reliant on the demon formula to fill out their respective tales, so much so it has become jaded and utterly unsurprising.

This hurts this picture and it runs away with itself, rendering the big final quarter - complete with emotional baggage - as something of a let down; though the final shot has goosebump value for sure.

A town by the central California coast is invaded by circus-like extraterrestrials, who prey upon humans for their blood.

""Killer Klowns From Outer Space"" (1988) is a colorful and fun alien invasion flick in the mold of “Critters” from two years earlier but, unlike that flick, is too preposterous to suspend disbelief. For instance, “Critters” offers a good explanation for how one of the extraterrestrials appears like a striking rock star, but you’ll get nothing like that here.

Nevertheless, there are multiple funny moments and winsome redhead Suzanne Snyder is a highlight as Debbie. Also, John Vernon is entertaining as the curmudgeon officer and the sequence involving one of the Klowns using a certain character as a ventriloquist dummy is worth the price of admission.

An interesting interpretation is that the Klowns are analogous of the dispersed Israelites who learned to hide in plain sight and thrive (not just survive) by changing their names and taking control in their new environments thru influencing and manipulating entertainment, politics, the media and financing (e.g. Federal Reserve banking).

13022,John Chard,"Never smile at a crocodile. Don't be taken in by his welcome grin.

Rogue is co-produced, written and directed by Greg Mclean (Wolf Creek). It stars Michael Vartan, Radha Mitchell, Sam Worthington & John Jarratt. The film is inspired by the true story of ""Sweetheart"", a giant Australian crocodile that terrorised boats in a 5 year period between 1974 & 1979. Plot sees travel journalist Pete McKell (Vartan) in the Northern Territory of Australia finishing off his latest feature. With time to kill he joins a river boat cruise led by spunky local lass Kate Ryan (Mitchell). So along with assorted other tourists, they set off up river. Where after a tricky encounter with a couple of local nuisances, one of the tourists spies a distress flare further up stream, then another, and another. As captain of the boat, Kate is duty bound to respond to aid anyone who may be in distress on the waters. However, this means straying into ""sacred waters"" and before they know it, they are in the middle of the hunting ground of a gigantic crocodile - who promptly attacks the boat and forces the group onto the nearest mini island, an island that is in tidal waters and the tide is coming in...

Upon viewing Rouge it would seem that it may be one of the most unfortunate horror releases of the time. It barely got a theatrical release outside of its own country (practically one week in selected cinemas in America & Europe), and it came out at a time when killer-croc movies were appearing almost every other month; Primeval, Black Water and Lake Placid 2 (good grief) all ""surfaced"" (hrr hrr hrr) during 2007 to take a ""chomp"" (ok I'll stop now) of the movie watching public. This following on from the sub-genre of aquatic reptile horror movies already being well served by Steve Miner's Lake Placid (1999) & Lewis Teague's Alligator (1980), both of which have huge fan bases. It's all relevant because Rogue happens to be the best of the bunch, a snappy (sorry, couldn't resist), scary, fun and slickly produced Aussie movie. It's sickening that reams of sub-standard horror remakes get wide distribution whilst something like this, that deserves the chance at least, can't. The Weinstein Bothers should be ashamed of themselves for the treatment of Mclean's film.

Straight away we should make clear that, as its certification suggests, Rouge is not particularly bloody. Those in need of sequence after sequence of a crocodile tearing humans limb from limb need not seek this film out. While it is in no way able to live with Lake Placid in terms of being ""intentionally"" humorous, thus comedy seekers should approach with caution, what Rogue does offer is a movie that's tightly structured and paced to precision. Packed with suspense, Mclean affords the characters some time to actually impact on the story. The first half hour is technically sublime, as we get to know the various folk on board the boat, we are treated to gorgeous cinematography from Will Gibson (location the estuaries of the Northern Territory), accompanied by one of the most pleasingly orchestral scores ever laid down for a creature feature (François Tetaz - with the nods to Jaws being just fine). All of this of course serves to offer up the calm before the inevitable storm, from where Mclean then follows the marker set by Jaws by not giving us full sight of the croc. It's the ultimate tease until the attacks start, but even then its mostly teasing suggestion, so the tension mounts as we couple it with our own imagination.

What unfolds from here is a series of set pieces as our stranded group try to avoid becoming crocodile lunch. Here normally a film of this ilk shows dumb people doing dumb things, but Mclean shows respect to the genre and its fans by having some of these folk do silly yet understandable things, thus the scares are elicited by way of believable reactions. And of course the situation brings out the best and worst from most of them since peril has a funny way of doing this to a human being. Also of note here is that Mclean doesn't make the croc a monster, this is merely a hungry animal protecting its territory. A quick piece of dialogue earlier in the story had pointed to hunters possibly being the ones who fired the distress flares, as croc goes about his snarly way, it doesn't hurt to remember this pertinent fact. The cast all give credible performances, notably the handsome hero in waiting Vartan, Mitchell (who was becoming something of a screen queen darling back then) & Jarratt, who shows us a different string to his acting bow than the one he played as loony Mick Taylor in Wolf Creek.

The movie has flaws, but they are few and far between. The croc on appearance will irk some people, so it's true that Mclean could have done better there, while one ""WTF"" turn of events loses impact as the director isn't as bold to follow through like he did in Wolf Creek, but they are forgivable irks. For as we find ourselves holding our breaths during the creepy and practically silent finale, that culminates in a fine ""B"" movie bit of outrageousness, we realise that above all else it's been the suspense and ominous foreboding that made this one damn effective thriller. Mclean appeared to be holding a grudge against his native country, his first two films back then were hardly enticing the tourists to explore the gorgeous lands of Australia! What ever his means or motivation, long may it continue if he keeps producing films like this. Lets hope that his future projects are not as ignored as this one was, because for sure there is a very good director here and it would be tragic should a talent be burned by how his movie was handled.

7737,RalphRahal,"Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) takes the franchise in a full post-apocalyptic direction, but the execution stumbles along the way. The story has a few interesting ideas, like the cloning subplot, but it lacks depth and struggles to keep engagement. The first act drags on endlessly, the second act picks up slightly, and the climax, while unique in some ways, fails to deliver the punch it needed. It feels like the movie is more focused on style than substance, which might have worked better if the pacing was tighter.

The directing and editing are a mess, making the action scenes frustrating to watch. The shaky cam is back, and somehow, it is worse than in Apocalypse, making some moments borderline unwatchable. The overuse of quick cuts doesn’t help either, making it feel like the action is happening in pieces rather than flowing naturally. That being said, the cinematography has some cool moments, especially in the desert setting, and the final battle at least tries to be creative.

Milla Jovovich remains the glue holding everything together. Even when the plot loses steam, she keeps things somewhat enjoyable with her commanding presence and well-executed fight scenes. The script, unfortunately, does not add much, with weak dialogue and little emotional weight. The soundtrack sticks to the industrial rock vibe, but at this point, it feels like the series is relying on style to cover up a lack of substance. Overall, Extinction has moments that work, but it feels more like an action movie trying to throw in zombies rather than a true continuation of what made the first film engaging.",2025-02-03T10:28:11.967Z,4.0,Resident Evil: Extinction,2007

“Idle Hands” (1999) is a manic horror comedy with macabre humor and lots o’ gore, influenced by bits from flicks like “Evil Dead 2,” “Re-Animator” and “An American Werewolf in London.” It’s often legitimately funny because it takes situations or lines and goes one step further for an over-the-top effect, similar to “There's Something About Mary” from the year before, just with a totally different milieu. 

Jessica Alba turned 17 one week into shooting in 1998 and is a highlight. Meanwhile Vivica A. Fox is effective as a Druidic priestess hunting down the spirit responsible for the nefarious goings-on.

People think it is a horror, but it was a fantasy-horror. According to the director, it is a supernatural theme. You may ask what's the big deal, but if you watch the film you will get, particularly the conclusion twist. It was a decent film with a good cast. It marks the return of the wonder boy Jacob Tremblay, after a tremendous performance debut from the Oscar nominated film 'Room'. Once again, he was brilliant, but due to the different theme, it might not be recognisation on a big scale. The main narration was led by Kate Bosworth, really worth mentioning her role as she was excellent like never before in the lead.

When a young couple lose their son, they adopt an eight year old boy, Cody. It's a new start for them, as well as for the boy, but after a few days later they come to know the boy has some kind of supernatural power. So they begin to use him for their own gain and neglect him on the other ground. But it won't stay long that way, as one day a dreadful event happens, followed many similar. The remaining narration is to tell us how they're going to fix it, but the real question is, is it possible to solve.

It's a better film than what the rating states. But the issue was it is kind of improvised version of 'Oculus'. And it is not too scary or the too soft narration, but the kind of ending it had, it should have been targeted the families and children with more leaning on the fantasy stuffs. I think the horror concept brought in just to attract the adult crowds. Overall, it can be watched by everyone and that excludes little kids. For me the ending part made me consider it a good film. Because I believe everyone had such misunderstanding, growing up at that stage of the life, so did I.

11683,John Chard,"Romero lines up the Bush administration for à la carte eats.

Land Of The Dead is directed & written by George A. Romero and it's the fourth film in his Zombie based series of films. It stars Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, Eugene Clark & Asia Argento.

Human society has regrouped and formed a new community in a sealed off section of America. Run by a feudal government headed by Paul Kaufman (Hopper), the state survives on supplies garnered from the outside world by Riley (Baker) and his ""Dead Reckoning"" team. But during one of their raids they notice that one of the Zombies, Big Daddy (Clark), is starting to show signs of human awareness.

After the emergence of the Dawn Of The Dead remake in 2004 and the plaudits heaped upon zom-com Shaun Of The Dead also in 2004, one question immediately sprang to the minds of zombie fans, ""could Romero, the don of the dead, be stirred into a new entry in his already heralded series?"". Yes was the joyous answer to that, and although a torn ligament down from previous instalments, the great news is that Land Of The Dead rocks with gore and politico fervour. Naturally a lot has changed in the world of zombiedom since Romero's last venture in 85, but he manages to tonally keep the old fashioned feel while observing the unsteady social climate that was seeping from the wounds in 2005.

By his own admission he is taking pot shots at the Bush administration, while Hopper, on delightfully excessive form, deliberately channels Donald Rumsfeld. From fireworks in the sky bringing conformity, to class division down on the turf, Romero as always has something to say. The cast are a solid and energetic bunch, with Baker pleasingly coming up trumps as a hero type, while gore hounds are very well served here as George finds new and inventive ways of delivering the ick (one ""head"" sequence is genius). Sure there's a suggestion that the central idea of the zombies getting smarter is kind of going off tangent, but since he wrote the rules, he's also allowed to change them. But with this ending here it offers hope, not just in this skew whiff world he's created, but also of further film's to come.

A hedonistic hair stylist in Pittsburgh (Patricia Arquette) experiences stigmata, the manifestations of the various wounds of Christ, which compels the Vatican to send an investigator (Gabriel Byrne).

“Stigmata” (1999) is Christian-oriented mystery/horror, coming across as a meshing of the tone of “Eye of the Beholder” (1998) and the themes of “The Seventh Sign” (1988). But also brings to mind the contemporaneous “End of Days” (1999), albeit more rooted in drama than overblown action thrills. “The Mothman Prophecies” (2002) is another reference point, but the brilliance of the eerie “Mothman” was its confidence in understatement whereas “Stigmata” overdoes it in some sequences, I guess to appeal to those with ADHD.

Jessica Rothe leads the follow-up to Blumhouse's surprise 2017 smash hit of riveting, repeating twists and comic turns. This time, our hero Tree Gelbman (Rothe) discovers that dying over and over was surprisingly easier than the dangers that lie ahead. Jason Blum once again produces, and Christopher Landon returns to write and direct this next chapter.

I don’t have a Happy Death Day review online, but I agree with the adjectives above-mentioned. It was one of last year’s surprises, and I genuinely had great fun with it. Overall, I would have rated it a B/B+, in case you’re wondering. But let’s get to its sequel and find out if it stood up to the original’s level…  

Short answer: no. Not even close. Honestly, it even diminishes what the first one accomplished. The 2017 original flick was a refreshing surprise because it took a different concept and mixed a bunch of genres in an unexpectedly entertaining way. It was funny, imaginative and Jessica Rothe proved to be a star in the making. 2U just has Rothe. That’s it. Its comedy bits only worked a couple of times throughout the whole runtime, and there wasn’t a single scary sequence that didn’t remind me of thousands of other familiar scenes done better in other films.

This movie is simply an easy money-grab, and BlumHouse doesn’t mind if it doesn’t stand up to the original as long as it succeeds in the box office, which it already did. Unfortunately, that’s how Hollywood and the world of cinema works nowadays. If an unique and even risky film, one that was only planned to be a single installment, becomes a box office hit, chances are that a sequel is going to be produced, even if it has to wrongly retcon what happened in the original movie, consequently taking some of its value. This rarely works quality-wise, but I can’t deny that, as a marketing strategy, it’s very profitable for studios.

My main issue with Happy Death Day 2U is that it risks too much with no reasonable payoff. Story-wise, it has tons of logical incongruencies, and I don’t buy the ending, at all. Christopher Landon asks too much of the audience since we have to accept so much nonsense in order to actually enjoy the film. In the original movie, the only thing we needed to “go with” was the actual concept, but that was pretty clear from the get-go. In 2U, there’s a compelling and captivating moral dilemma at its core, but that same dilemma becomes less and less like one by the end of it. It’s still a complicated situation, but it’s like they forgot what was really important and went with other poorly explained route.

It doesn’t matter the genre from which you analyze this film. If you look at it as a comedy, you’ll barely laugh. If you think of it as a scary movie, you’ll never get scared. If you want to be intrigued by who the killer is this time around, you won’t be because the mystery is pretty straightforward. I really don’t want to rant on this film because I do love its cast and I really enjoyed the first movie, but it’s really hard not to be upset since it damages an eventual second viewing of the first one now. When the original installment doesn’t have an open door to other adventures, just don’t try to make a sequel for the sake of it. I know, I know… Money. Bah.

I don’t want to end this review on a sad note, so I left the brilliant cast to the end. Everyone is fantastic, and I hope that at least this film can catapult some of these actors into the spotlight, especially Jessica Rothe. She has a tremendous range of expressions and incredible ease in changing between emotions. She can look scared, sad and happy in a matter of seconds, with tears and all. She’s a full package. I hope that she can grab either a major role on a big TV series or a supporting role in a blockbuster or Oscar-bait movie in the next couple of years. Surely, Jason Blum has some plans for her.

All in all, Happy Death Day 2U does not deserve the box office success that it is having. It’s receiving a lot of credit due to the 2017 original’s surprise hit, and that’s unfair to the first installment. This sequel not only wrongly retcons unnecessary plot details of its predecessor, but it makes that correction its main plot, continuously reminding the audience that we just have to accept it. It’s not as funny, scary, unique or surprisingly entertaining as the original, and if the returning cast didn’t deliver strong performances, this would be one of the worst films of the year. Fortunately, there are a couple of good moments here and there, and Jessica Rothe alone saves the movie from a much more negative review. 

Oh, and please, do NOT make a third one! Just leave it alone.

I didn't need an explanation or really much of anything that I saw in _2U_. But I guess something had to give if _Happy Death Day_ was going to get a sequel, and as I said, I didn't dislike this. I actually actively did like it. I just don't think it was up to the standard off the first, which even then, was good but not great.

10766,talisencrw,"This wasn't as good as Richard Donner's superb original, but it's a solid sequel. It lacks the unique sense of despair and menace of one's own child perhaps being the Antichrist, and the suspense is neither as taut nor as skillfully handled, but there are some great death scene set-pieces here, and it's not as bad as horror fans would let you think it is. I have a special place in my heart for the religious thriller, so perhaps I'm a tad more lenient than I should be in my grading, but I could very well say that the devil made me do it, or at the very least, his spawn. Jerry Goldsmith does another fine soundtrack, albeit not with the two Oscar nominations and one win this time around, while William Holden and Lee Grant do a credible job of replacing stars Gregory Peck and Lee Remick, whom Damien had no qualms dispensing with in the first film.

I think the problem with this follow up is that having already been exposed to the style of horror this offers: the sharp violin music, tight facial close ups, and the use of an animal (in this case it is a crow) as his implement of choice, there is very little by way of a shock factor. Holden is way past his best as an actor, the dialogue adds little to the rather lacklustre sense of menace and the ending is completely devoid of any real jeopardy.

I just saw this movie, which is currently considered a cult classic and an example of what you want from a low-budget movie. In fact, I understand the motivations of those who say this: the film is not good, it is not one of those films that I feel I will want to review a lot, however it is effective and gives us what it promises, in an honest way.

The script also has its originality, although it is scarce and only sustains a feature film thanks to the ability of the director, the ""newbie"" Stan Winston, to stretch it, albeit at the expense of a slower pace, which he tried to take advantage of to create Suspense: Set in an isolated rural area, the film is an insane revenge story, in which a man decides to turn to an evil witch after having his young son killed in an accident by a group of unconscious teenagers.

The actors are, for me, illustrious strangers. However, I really liked the performance of Lance Henrikssen, who is the only actor here to maintain a dramatic posture, to have charisma and to develop a more professional and mature work. In addition to giving life to the anguished father, he also gave life and body to the monster, who is the true protagonist of this film. The film also has several other actors, most of them quite young and with little experience.

On a technical level, I would like to highlight, first of all, the painstaking and time-consuming work of characterizing Henrikssen whenever he brought the monster to life. I can only imagine all the time spent each time the actor had to masquerade like that, and that disguise was excellent in itself, truly frightening and detailed. The filming work and cinematography seemed to be regular, the sets were well executed and the visual, special and sound effects are well done, especially considering the reduced budget of the production. The soundtrack also proved to be effective, albeit forgettable.",2022-06-18T10:55:47.941Z,5.0,Pumpkinhead,1988
10657,John Chard,"The young carpenter from Nazareth? I know him well. Promising young man. He died badly.  

Needful Things is directed by Fraser C. Heston and is adapted for the screen by W.D. Richter from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Max von Sydow, Ed Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, J. T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. The community of Castle Rock in Maine is all a tizzy when a new curio gift shop called Needful Things opens its doors. The proprietor is the mysterious Leland Gaunt (Sydow), who agrees to part with special goods in return for the buyer playing pranks on somebody in the community. Pranks that will have far reaching consequences for everyone in Castle Rock. 

To enjoy Needful Things a number of factors will need to be taken into consideration: have you read the book, do you like the book, do you even like Stephen King as a rule and are you expecting another adaptation like Misery (1990)? I wouldn't dream of trying to sell this as a great King adaptation for the big screen, because it's not, but that's no great surprise since great King adaptations seem to come around about as often as Halley's Comet! But it does have much going for it as a time filling piece of entertainment. The book was a door stopper (I personally thought it was great), but Heston (son of Chuck) and Richter have trimmed off the edges and condensed the core aspects of the book into what is now a two hour movie (it was originally a three hour cut). The result is a pacey piece of devilment that's flecked by horror as it sneakily observes human foibles. 

Boasting a better budget that's normally afforded a middle tier King adaptation, Needful Things also benefits from being able to assemble a very strong cast. And on the money they are too. Sydow has a great time, relishing another chance to play charismatic villainy and Harris as the Sheriff is a bastion of hard working honest Americana. Among the supporting cast of the unstable variety, Amanda Plummer nails the role of timid waitress Nettie Cobb, playing it like a coiled spring waiting to unwind, while J. T. Walsh (always value for money as a character actor) does a neat line in corporate bully boy loony on the edge. It's here with the number of characters in the story that the negative flip side of the film shows its hand. With the trimming and cutting comes the inevitable absence of character development, something that is evident both in the book and the film's extended form. So here's the final question on if you can enjoy the film: can you accept lack of depth in the narrative to get a brisker film? 

As it stands it asks a lot from its audience, and without doubt it doesn't have all the answers. But if entering with average expectations, and able to answer yes and no in the right places to the questions posed above? You might just enjoy this more than you thought possible at the outset. 6.5/10",2019-03-15T22:19:56.534Z,6.0,Needful Things,1993
10657,Wuchak,"**_What if the devil literally came to town?_**

What would happen if satan actually visited an American town, albeit undercover? In this case it's a small New England coastal village (shot in British Columbia). Ed Harris plays the main protagonist while Bonnie Bedelia appears as his girlfriend, and Max Von Sydow is on hand as the mysterious shopkeeper who moves into town and causes havoc by selling the villagers their most deepest desires for the price of a ""deed."" So, what would happen if the devil came to town? Would he make it a heathen paradise? A fun, hedonistic haven? Not bloody likely.

Like all Stephen King films based on his books, ""Needful Things"" (1993) takes place in a small town and has a comic book air. It borrows the concept used in ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" (1983) and makes a more compelling flick.

Since the movie utilizes biblical themes I'll consider it from that perspective for the sake of reviewing. According to the bible, the blessing of the Lord produces the qualities of the Garden of Eden, that is, paradise, which is why it says that the kingdom of heaven is a matter of righteousness, peace, joy and power. By contrast, the devil's kingdom produces un-righteousness, strife, war, anxiety, depression, misery, bondage and helplessness.

The fictional town of Castle Rock was a veritable haven before Leland Gaunt (Sydow) moved to town. Sure, there were the typical petty dislikes and rivalries, etc. but, generally speaking, it was a nice place to live, a small coastal paradise, which is what motivated Ed Harris' character to live there. Of course, Gaunt is intent on changing all this.

I just find it interesting the way the new shopkeeper slowly turns the town into a literal living hell. He utilizes the people's petty dislikes, paranoias and jealousies against them.

""Needful Things"" may not be great and it's definitely not scary, but it's effective in a theological sense as a creepy satanic take-over through simple manipulation of human nature. 

The theatrical version runs 2 hours and the TV version 3 hours. I've never seen the latter, but I'm sure it's the better version in that it further fleshes out the characters.

758323,CinemaSerf,"Based on a real character from the murkier side of quite recent Vatican operations, Russell Crowe dons his cassock and travels to a remote abbey in Spain where his meets with ""Fr. Esquibel"" (Daniel Zovatto). Why? Well it seems that a young boy is being possessed by a singularly nasty demon. Now Fr. Amorth is not unused to these scenarios and is also aware that the vast majority of these situations have nothing to do with satanic practices and more to do with mental health issues. Quickly, though, he realises that this is a serious and potentially deadly demonisation and both he and his colleague must discover what went on at this place and just who their violent foe is, before they can have any hope of casting it back into the shadows. That's the plot, and to be fair Crowe actually plays his character with a bit of charisma, but the rest of this is the same old loudly scored, visual effects feast with plenty of routine dramatic scenes: screaming, eye-popping, ceiling climbing, bodies and holy water thrown about the place and this one even has a bit of the Spanish Inquisition thrown in for added authenticity. It's not that is terrible - it isn't; it is just all so very derivative. Just because the exorcist was real doesn't actually make this film any different from an whole spate of other similar films that have the same beginning, middle, and end...

758323,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"When you buy a ticket for a movie like “The Pope’s Exorcist” it’s pretty clear what you’re getting into. There’s a ton of Catholic imagery like the rosary, crucifixes, holy water, church rituals, and lots of prayers, all used to fight off the demonic possession of an innocent. All of the standard elements are present here, but director Julius Avery‘s film surprisingly offers a refreshing (if somewhat routine) take on the religious horror subgenre.

Elevated by a well thought-out story and an engaging performance from Russell Crowe, the film tells the story of Father Gabriele Amorth (Crowe), Chief Exorcist of the Vatican (and one of the most controversial figures in the Church’s modern era). The script is inspired by the Father’s actual files of his time spent conducting exorcisms for the Catholic Church, which is enough to make your skin crawl.

The movie follows Father Amorth as he travels to Spain to investigate a young boy’s (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) possession by a powerful demon. Aided by local priest Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto), Father Amorth tries to help the child before it’s too late. In the process, he uncovers a centuries-old conspiracy that the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden.

It’s a really great story, and one that feels more plausible than other religious horror fantasies about supernatural possessions. (You know what I mean). There are solid scares, bloody violence, and creepy imagery that are all done quite well. It’s slightly goofy but played with sincerity, which is why the film never teeters on the edge of camp. This isn’t a case of a movie that’s so bad it’s good, it actually is good.

While it may seem like there isn’t a lot here to separate the film from other exorcism stories (especially when there are several scenes of priests reciting prayers while brandishing crosses at a child who, possessed by a demon, is screaming obscenities in a growling voice), the depth of the storytelling is what makes a huge difference. Every element clicks in unison here, from the screenplay to the direction to the better than expected performances.

“The Pope’s Exorcist” is the type of movie that should be forgettable, but isn’t. I actually enjoyed it because it overdelivers on what it promises, and is a lot better than you’d expect.

Towards the end of the movie, I literally starting thinking, “wow, Crowe and Zovatto should star in future installments as ass-kicking priest sidekicks,” and bam! The film went ahead and set itself up for a sequel: 199 of them, to be exact. As batty as this sounds, I would — pun intended — watch the hell out of that.

758323,Nathan,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed The Pope's Exorcist. After initially seeing the trailers, I wrote this movie off as a standard possession film that I have seen time and time again, and while most of that is still true, there is something about this film that made it a joy to watch.

The film does not attempt to do anything particularly new or groundbreaking in the genre, but everything it has is handled with care and precision. The direction is fantastic, with a very quick pace that makes each scene have a sense of urgency as our characters attempt to perform the exorcism. There is particularly deep lore that is established within the church structure, with different factions and politics at play that add a slightly different dimension rather than just your run-of-the-mill ""insert random priest here.""

My favorite aspect of the film is the acting. I think all of the adult characters do a tremendous job here. Russell Crowe kills it in every scene he is in and definitely gives an entirely different take on the exorcist character. Where most are intensely serious and melodramatic, Crowe adds a bit of whimsicalness and youth to the character that creates a calming presence to every intense scene. His rapport with Daniel Zovatto is excellent. The two really play off each other well and carried the film in many ways. Alex Essoe was great, although underutilized. The two children were okay. The boy gave a very stereotypical portrayal of a possessed child, and the daughter was flat in many ways.

My only complaint about the entire film is its lack of originality and the story. Every single beat is something that we have seen before; there were no new or fresh ideas that were interjected into the story. The tension was fine, but nothing was particularly scary. Overall, if not for the film's fantastic director and cast, it would have been a bomb.

631842,garethmb,"Knock At The Cabin Is A Tense And Engaging Thriller
Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan is back with his new thriller “Knock at
the Cabin” and like his earlier works; the film blends reality with
supernatural elements to put ordinary people in circumstances that are
dangerous and unnatural.
The film involves a same-sex couple named Eric (Jonathan Groff) and Andrew
(Ben Aldridge), who have taken their adopted daughter Wen (Kristen Cui),
to a secluded cabin for a relaxing vacation.

The arrival of four strangers lead by the imposing but soft-spoken Leonard
(Dave Bautista) becomes dangerous when Leonard informs them that the world
is about to end and only by choosing to sacrifice one of them can the
Apocalypse be diverted.

Leonard explains that the four had the same vision of the end of the world
and that they were drawn to save it by taking such drastic actions. They
inform their captives that they will not harm them but they will not be
allowed to leave as they must make the choice and failure to do so will
doom everyone and force the three of them to exist as the sole-survivors
of the aftermath.

Convinced that the intruders are insane; Eric and Andrew refuse the offer
and watch as one of the four captives sacrifices themselves which is soon
followed by news on the television of a massive earthquakes which resulted
in tsunamis.

Convinced it is a ruse or simply timed events to the days news; the
captives again refuse a request only to see another sacrifice followed by
more news of devastation happening around the world.

What follows is a tight thriller as Eric and Andrew learn more about their
captives and the changing world situation which forces them to confront a
world gone mad.

The film is good at setting a tone and maintaining a mild tension
throughout as the audience is left to wonder how real what is being
presented by Leonard and his associates are. I liked the fact that the
movie did not try to wrap things up nice and tidy and left the audiences
with some questions about the events as well as what would happen in the
aftermath.

Bautista gives an career-best performance and shows that his is capable of
doing more than the action-comedy genre which he has been playing to date
and I hope he continues to seek roles such as this.

While the film may not reach the levels of some of his earlier classics,
Shyamalan has crafted an entertaining film that keeps you guessing.

631842,tensharpe,"“Knock at the Cabin” is a suspenseful, thriller with horror elements that wastes no time in its execution. After less than five minutes, the idyllic vacation choice of Eric and Andrew, dads to Wen, is turned into a nightmare home invasion. Leonard ( Dave Bautista ) tries to engage with Wen showing gentleness and countering the stereotype his muscular size conveys. Happily catching grasshoppers together, Leonard and Wen discuss family and future ambition. However once Leonard is joined by his three other companions his insistence and subsequent forceful entry to the cabin makes his character seem far more sinister. 

Denial and paranoia set the tone as the four invading characters disclose their backgrounds and cult like vision that has set them on a mission to save the World from the Apocalypse. During back and forth conversations and threat of death, love and compassion strongly prevails even after some graphic killing. When faced with the reality of the home invaders reasoning for their actions, Eric and Andrew’s rising panic with each separate revelation fuels suffocating tension that continues to grow until the final moments. With very clever use of the four headless horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the persuasive nature of Leonard, eventually Eric and Andrew believe what they are being told.

Throughout “Knock at the Cabin” M. Night Shyamalan’s direction keeps the audience constantly questioning. Are the events unfolding on screen actually real or just cult like paranoia twisting events to suit their agenda. With excellent performances and great use of lighting and cinematography to convey fear and rising tension, “Knock at the Cabin” is an engaging end of the World thriller.",2023-02-09T08:40:39.871Z,7.0,Knock at the Cabin,2023

Bautista is quite good here, as is Aldridge and for a while the plot is actually quite intriguing. The ultimate catch-22 with a question posed to rational people - who love each other - that would test any of us. Sadly, though, M Night Shyamalan can't keep the intrigue sustained and it rather runs out of steam from the middle onwards. Groff doesn't really show up and neither, for that matter, does Rupert Grint. I also felt that young Cui takes a little too much screen time and grates after a while. It's the shortest of short stories, and might have worked better had it just been the hour with a tighter narrative and less meandering.

It’s not that _Knock at the Cabin_ is entirely bad, it’s that it seems to actively know it could be more creative, thrilling, and shocking and yet purposely chooses to bury its head in the sand and let mediocrity have its remorselessly bland way with it.

631842,Nathan,"Knock at the Cabin is an interesting premise that has a lot going for it in terms of atmosphere and mystique but fails to land a satisfactory ending.

I was pleasantly surprised with the story structure. The movie wastes no time throwing the audience into the conflict within the opening frames of the film. This allowed for an increased focus on the main story while maintaining a decent pace. The first act of the film is great, as the audience is new to the story and the mystery is still fresh. But slowly, the plot starts to repeat the same beats resulting in a less engaging second act. As the film draws to its conclusion it’s ending is incredibly predictable which slightly worked for me but may be divisive to a general audience. I did enjoy the small flashbacks of the couple's life. It added much needed context without taking too much time away from the main story arch.

The acting in the film is overall good, but there are some major characters that stand out from the rest of the cast. Dave Bautista was excellent, he had a very serious, menacing presence, but had a kind and gentle nature to him that begged the audience to trust him. This was by far one of his more complex roles in his career and I think he did a great job. Abby Quinn had probably my favorite performance of the film. Her dramatic scenes were mesmerizing and really drew me in. She had such subtle facial gestures that expressed a deep sense of fear and sadness with eyes that could tell a story by themselves. It was superb. Jonathan Groff was good, although he really seems to be playing a similar style of character to all of his previous roles. I was excited to see Rupert Grint, but we do not really get to see enough of him as he is only in the film's first act and when he is present barely talks.

Cinematography was great. There were some really interesting camera angles and shots that were classic from Shyamalan. I thought he did a really good job of portraying the brutality of what was occurring without actually showing it. Having it pan away from the action or it being just out frame gave the audience what they needed to know without directly seeing it. It slightly added to the suspense of it all. Although, as a true horror fan, I would have loved to see some gore! There are some very corny sequences with terrible CGI that took me out of this movie. But with a budget of only $20m, I am not sure what more I could have asked for.

Overall, there is a lot to like about Knock at the Cabin, but it is missing multiple key elements that hold it back from being a Shyamalan instant classic. Despite that, I think it was an enjoyable watch that I recommend you check out in theaters.

Other than that every character behaves in a realistic way, only issue that I have with the movie is that I would've preferred an open ended ending, but a lot of people hate that in general, so those people will be happy to know that the movie makes it pretty clear what was going on.",2025-07-10T03:50:33.320Z,,Knock at the Cabin,2023
663712,Nathan,"_Terrifier 2_ is a massive improvement over its parent film but doesn't quite do enough to move the needle for me. From the get-go, this films tone and quality is drastically superior to the previous entry. The writing gives characters room to develop, and audiences can actually grow attached to characters in way that was blatantly absent from the first film. I enjoyed the added lore for Art that was sprinkled throughout, adds a level of depth to the newly founded horror icon. The writing allows for much more creative kills and set pieces, with the story taking place across an entire town rather than one claustrophobic apartment building. But with all those improvements, there are still lingering problems that carried over from the first film. Actor performances were all over the board. Some actresses were really compelling and honestly shocked me for the indie type feel of the film. Some notable highlights for me were the lead actress _Lauren LaVera_, _Kailey Hyman_, and _Elliott Fullam_. But other performances were legitimately bad, it felt like I was watching a high school drama production. There are some major pacing problems, for starters this movie is almost 2.5 hours long. There is no need for a runtime this long, there is so much fluff in here that it really bogs down the flow of the film. This movie does a better job of adding suspense to its scenes but is too reliant on blood and gore to get its gasps from the audience. I normally am one to appreciate when a movie goes above and beyond in the gore department, but this movie went overboard. So many scenes had be physically ill due to the graphic content. Sometimes less is more and that is for sure the case here. Despite its flaws, this is a great next step for this small-time studio and with the success at the box office there will surely be a sequel where Dameon Leone has the opportunity to craft a real top notch horror film.

Positives:

The kills. Very brutal and gory. I would say bloodier than the first. 
I think there is more of a story than in the first Terrifier. More character development with the brother and sister.

Negatives

I think 2 hrs 18 mins is way too long. I feel that in the middle it was a little slow and could have been cut.
I was hoping for more of a backstory of Art the Clown but they spent more time on the brother and sister than him.
Does Terrifier 2 fit into the Terrifier franchise? Yes. If you enjoyed the first movie you should watch Terrifier 2. If you were on the fence about the first one, check this one out. If you don’t like blood and gore, pass on this movie.

It's just like one of those video games where the dead never stay dead for long, and so with this immortality comes a sense of ennui as the plot struggles to engage or innovate and ends up like an extended edition of ""Scooby Do"".

667216,Nathan,"Infinity Pool is a horny, horrifying look at ego and self-indulgence based on self-doubt and failure. The film follows novelist James Foster (Alexander Skarsgard) as he is mesmerized by Gabi (Mia Goth) resulting in a stained week of violence and debauchery. 

The plot is a story of two halves, the first being incredibly strong as the audience is learning the mystery behind the experiments, guests and their past. Viewers can resonate a ton with Foster's wife as she is constantly neglected and misused by her husband. That is ever apparent in the shot selection as she is constantly out of frame or unfocused. This part really worked for me, but as the story progressed the scope grew too large for its own good. The ending becomes unfocused, resulting in aspects that do not make sense or are incredibly unbelievable in the world that the film has set up.

The film has fantastic cinematography though, filled with interesting visuals that create for a very unique and chaotic viewing experience. Every shot is calculated and filmed in an interesting way that creates suspense and uncomfortable feelings.

The performances are superb, Mia Goth has found her niche in the ""elevated"" horror genre becoming a modern-day scream queen. Although, after X, Pearl, and now Infinity Pool, I would like to see her do some more diverse work, but she has nailed this type of character. Alexander Skarsgard is also great with some emotionally engrossing scenes mixed with cold, emotionless scenes that create an interesting dichotomy for the characters headspace.

Although the film slightly stumbles towards the end and might have a bit of a bloated run time, there is still a ton to enjoy with a creative story, mind bending cinematography, and powerhouse performances.

It’s super weird and obviously a different type of film that won’t appeal to the typical mainstream blockbuster crowd.

The film takes an interesting detour into what defines gluttony and to what extremes humans will undergo in order to feel hungry again when their stomachs are already bloated from overeating.

However, the movie loses its way quickly, and the storyline becomes too bizarre for its own good. The events that unfold towards the end are confusing, and there seems to be no clear message to take away from them.

The actors' performances are commendable, and the production values are excellent. The visual effects and cinematography are well-executed, but unfortunately, they cannot compensate for the muddled and confusing storyline.

That's quite intriguing, but the rest of this recycles that theory as an increasingly debauched and unentertaining series of scenarios are played out in front of us, presumably in order to illustrate a range of human frailties and issues with confidence and self-belief. There is one rather amusing scene with Goth on the bonnet of her car towards the end, but the remainder of this is just a rather messy, drug infused, meander of a story that left me wondering why it went on for almost two hours. At times the writing is quite smart, but all too infrequently to sustain this thinnest of stories and by midway through I could honestly say that I couldn't have cared less about any of them - even if Skarsgård does have a nice ass.

On arrival at the manor house she has rented for a fortnight, she is welcomed by the typical country squire type in ""Geoffrey"" (Rory Kinnear). She goes for a walk, during which she notices that she is being followed - and the man following her is naked. Spooked, she returns to her home to find that this is just the start of some seriously bizarre goings on in this tiny hamlet. What flaws this all from the start for me is that we see everyone in this community - the policeman, vicar, schoolboy, pub landlord as variations of the same man - Kinnear, yet the ""Harper"" character does not seem to clock this; she certainly doesn't acknowledge it, and that just doesn't work for me. If I were in a village where everyone looked the same, I'd have been out of there in a shot. Anyway, she lingers on for a while as things become more perilous and she is clearly the focus of the malevolent intentions of this creature - and it all builds to quite a clever feat of special effects and not a great deal else. There is a largely undeveloped underlying plot line about her on-the-rocks marriage that may have had some bearing on the conclusion, but to be honest I was rather bored by the repetition of it all by then. The exterior photography is nice enough and Buckley is competent, but Kinnear's roles are all about the skills of the make up artists. The dialogue is nothing special leaving the score to work hard to try to create a sense of peril that, in the end, I felt was just ... lacking.

""Men is undoubtedly one of the most unique, macabre, weird, expectedly divisive films of the year.

Rob Hardy's cinematography is truly impressive, navigating viewers through eye-popping visual details with the help of mesmerizing makeup and VFX. The score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow is also quite atmospheric and haunting.

Nevertheless, Alex Garland exhaustively repeats his obvious, heavy-handed message to the point of losing all emotional connection with the underdeveloped protagonist. The last act focuses too much on excessive, unpleasant gore to prove a point over and over again unnecessarily, functioning as a distracting, underwhelming conclusion.

Jessie Buckley - extraordinary - deserves much better, as does the versatile Rory Kinnear, who plays multiple roles.""

780609,Nathan,"Men, directed by Alex Garland, is a movie that fails to live up to its potential despite having some redeeming qualities.

The cinematography is fantastic and haunting, with creative shots that add to the overall experience. But this quality dips towards the end, with the director focusing more on horror elements in the tune of slasher/home invasion instead of psychological. The sound design is excellent, and the sinister feel really adds to the movie's overall mood. The acting is good, but nothing too spectacular. No performances really blew me away. However, the body horror in the movie is fantastic, and it had the hair on the back of my neck standing up. Even though I do think it is not entirely needed, I have to give props in that department.

Unfortunately, the script is pretty dreadful. The message is very in your face, overly complex and did not work for me. It was quite a turn off too, as it seemed as though the director was trying to say all men were the same and were terrible human beings. I know it had deeper meaning than that, but that surface level message is undeniable. I mean honestly, every person she encounters is such a massive piece of shit, not one person would have held out a helping hand? 

Something that did really bother me was that the movie starts off as a creative psychological horror, but takes a spin in the third act that divulges into body horror mixed with slasher elements, which really takes away from the intriguing first 45 minutes of the film. Combine that with dreadful pacing, which will result in the audience feeling like they're waiting for the movie to be over. 

Overall, Men is a forgettable movie that had potential, but unfortunately, failed to deliver in many aspects.

780609,griggs79,"Men, directed by Alex Garland, is a haunting exploration of grief, trauma, and the sinister dynamics of gender, wrapped in an atmospheric and unsettling narrative.

Rory Kinnear delivers a truly epic performance, embodying multiple characters with an eerie and disturbing versatility that is nothing short of remarkable. His ability to switch between personas, each more unsettling than the last, adds a layer of dread that permeates the entire film. Kinnear’s portrayal is both chilling and mesmerising, leaving a profound impact that elevates the film’s haunting themes and invites deep reflection.

Jessie Buckley is equally superb as Harper, a woman grappling with her past while confronting an escalating series of horrors. Her performance is deeply emotional, grounding the film with a raw, visceral intensity that makes her character’s journey compelling and harrowing. Buckley’s ability to convey a wide range of emotions, from vulnerability to defiance, makes her a perfect counterpart to Kinnear’s unsettling characters.

Men is the first film in a long time to move and terrify me equally. Garland masterfully balances psychological tension with moments of sheer terror, creating an unnerving experience that is as thought-provoking as it is captivating.

The incessant attempts to approach various subject matters through different genres destroy a screenplay that garnered attention for the simplicity of its premise, but which ends up becoming an unnecessarily complex mess without any idea of what it wants to be. Wasting David Harbour as a non-speaking ghost is one of many questionable creative decisions in this hard-to-remember Netflix film.""

9902,4EverFinalGirl,"I feel that Wrong Turn is an underrated and underappreciated horror movie. Yes, it’s bloody. Yes, the bad guys are inbred cannibals. But the cast is great, and the effects are also great for its time. You feel for these characters and their predicament.

PLOT

Five friends and a stranger, after a car crash, must survive in the woods while being hunted by inbred cannibals.

MY THOUGHTS

There’s roughly ten kills. I say roughly because “supposedly” two of the killers are killed, but since there are several sequels, we can assume they may have not died. The kills, the ones that are shown on screen, are bloody and good. Unfortunately there are a few that are shown off screen. I would say my favorite would have to be either Francine’s barbed wire death (to include the dismemberment later on) or Carly’s beheading.

The boring death would have to be either Evan’s, which is ear sliced off and Scott’s where he is just shot three times in the back with arrows. Neither were that interesting. I did feel bad for Scott since I actually like him. I could care less about Evan. He was annoying.

As far as acting goes, I think it was pretty decent. I found Eliza Dushku, Jeremy Sisto, Emmanuelle Chriqui, and Desmond Harrington did a good job with their characters, and I really felt for their characters.

Eliza Dushku (known for Soul Survivor, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Tru Calling) plays Jessie, a woman who recently ended a relationship. Her friends brought her out hiking to take her mind off of the breakup. Emmanuelle Chriqui (known for Crow: Wicked Prayer and Forever Knight) plays Carly, engaged to Scott, with wedding plans running through her head.

Jeremy Sisto (known for May, Nightmare and Dreamscapes, and Dead & Breakfast) plays Scott, Carly’s fiancee. And Desmond Harrington (known for The Hole, Taken, Ghost Ship, and the Neon Demon) plays Chris, the man late for a job interview who regrets taking a shortcut.

We start Wrong Turn with two college students rock climbing. When the young man gets to the top we hear what sounds like a struggle and then his body is thrown over the cliff. The girl’s rope is being pulled up so she cuts the rope and falls to the ground. She tries to get away, but is caught and killed off camera.

Next we meet Chris who is driving to what we assume is a job interview. He’s running late and there is a chemical spill on the road. He then decides to use a shortcut. He distracts himself and crashes into a jeep that is sitting on the side of the road. Here he meets 5 more people: Evan, Francine, Scott, Carly, and Jessie.

Jessie and her friends are on a hiking trip when they realize that their flat was caused by barbed wire that was purposely layed out in the road. Chris, Jessie, Carly, and Scott take off to find help, leaving Evan and Francine with the vehicles.

After messing around for a bit, Evan hears a noise and goes to investigate. After realizing he’s missing, Francine goes and looks for him. She doesn’t find him but she finds his shoe and his severed ear. She screams and tries to run off but is quickly captured and a barbed wire is stretched over her mouth and pulled. This causes her mouth to tear open, killing her.

Meanwhile the other four find a cabin and go in to investigate. They find various items, old and new, as well as body parts. Before they can leave, three people show up, so they hide. Chris and Jessie hide under a bed and Carly and Scott hide in a room with junk in it.

The three carry Carly’s body in and put it on the table and start dismembering and eating her! Their friends are horrified but are quiet until the three fall asleep. As they escape, Chris tries to distract the killers and they shoot him. So then Scott decides to distract the inbreds so Jessie and Carly can get Chris and steal the killer’s truck. They drive down a path hoping to find Scott. They see him and as he’s running to the truck the killers shoot him with three arrows, killing him.

The three drive off as the killers take Scotts body with them. They keep driving and find a ranger’s station/tower. They climb it, hoping for a radio and they find one but nobody answers when they call for help. Unfortunately for them, the killers see them and follow. When someone finally responds on the radio, the killers try to get into the room.
Unable to get to them they set fire to the tower. This causes Jessie, Chris, and Carly to have to climb out onto the tall trees. As they climb down, Carly is too scared to move, is caught by surprise and her head is chopped off with an ax!

Our final two, Chris and Jessie are able to cause one of the killers to get hit by a branch, and fall from the tree. They are able to escape, and hide in a cave until morning. They head out the next morning and finally see a road. Just then, the killers show up and push Chris down the hill. Jessie is captured and taken back to the cabin. She is chained to the bed, unable to escape.

Chris survives the fall and see’s a police officer. Before he can explain what is going on, the officer is shot with an arrow. Chris tries to take the vehicle but can’t find the keys. Instead, he hides under the killer’s truck, holding on while they leave to go back to the cabin with the officer’s body in the back.

Just before Jessie is killed, the front of the cabin is busted open when a vehicle bursts through, setting the cabin on fire. There’s a fight, but in the end Chris is able to blow up the cabin with the two killers inside. Jessie and Chris drive off.

As a note, there’s an end credit scene, so stay and watch it.

Overall, I think this is a great movie and a good cast. One of those kinds of movies that’s, yes bloody, and there’s killing, but you actually like the characters. You feel bad when some die or get hurt. I can’t say the same for the sequels though. So if you haven’t seen Wrong Turn, then you definitely should watch this.

And now for your Forever Final Girl Exclusive…Did you know?:

Emmanuelle Chriqui dislocated her shoulder performing her fall through the trees. You can hear her shoulder pop on the production track in the theatrical sound mix.

Several of the cast and crew were covered in poison ivy throughout the filming of the movie, this was due to the chairs being placed in what was first thought to be a group of weeds only later to be discovered as a patch of the rash causing plants.

During one of the last scenes in the movie, Eliza Dushku actually set actor Julian Richings (Three Finger) on fire.

When the four were running from the cabin after awakening the mountain men, Desmond Harrington broke his right ankle after landing on the opposite side of a log. This made it very difficult to shoot some of the scenes after his left leg is “shot” and he has to limp on his right leg.

Despite only being credited for his producing, Make-up master Stan Winston was pivotal in the key design of the Mountain Men, in particular now postmodern horror icon Three-Finger. This marks the second last major horror film he has been involved before his death in 2008 at age 62 and the third slasher horror film he had been involved in following unaccredited work in Friday The 13th Part II and III, the latter of which he had been a core designer on the original hockey mask of also horror icon Jason Voorhees and the respective mongoloid appearance of Jason for those two parts.

Screenwriter Alan B. McElroy also penned the script for the reboot Wrong Turn (2021).

Director Rob Schmidt said in the commentary that he considers this film to be his own personal tribute to the classics like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Hills Have Eyes (1977).

Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth also appear together in the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead. In this film their characters are in a relationship and both die, however, in Dawn of the Dead their characters both survive and are assumed to have started a relationship by the end.

The only film in the series that does not contain any sex or nudity.

The female lead character, Jessie Burlingame, was named after the heroine in Stephen King’s novel, “Gerald’s Game”.

There’s an additional scene halfway through the end credits, showing the fate of a state trooper who discovers a body in the burned-down cabin.

Eliza Dushku did a lot of her own stunts for the movie.

11954,adorablepanic,"LIFEFORCE (1985) - By the mid '80s, Cannon Films was looking to move away from low-budget, disposable fare like HOSPITAL MASSACRE (1981) and BREAKIN' 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO (1984). Owners Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus had loftier ambitions: They wanted a blockbuster; a big-budget smash that they could call their own. To this end, they signed director Tobe Hooper to a three-picture deal and turned him loose with $25,000,000 and free reign to create the movie he wanted. Working with a stellar, mostly British cast (save token American star Steve Railsback, who apparently misplaced his charisma at Heathrow; and startlingly uninhibited French goddess Mathilda May); legendary composer Henry Mancini; and a screenplay co-written by the man who wrote ALIEN (1979), Hooper unleashed a wonderfully unwieldy miasma of genres. What starts out as a science fiction mystery gradually morphs into full blown, zombie apocalypse horror - played with square-jawed seriousness by all involved. Unfortunately, this film got lost among that years' heavy-hitters like BACK TO THE FUTURE and the second RAMBO film, and earned back less than half its budget. Cannon Films ceased operations in 1994, but their ambitious attempt to stand amongst the major studios keeps giving back to its growing cult audience via home video.

The body is in an indescribable condition"" — but you just kind of described it, didn’t you?

releases a life energy"" that ""can be collected ... The male vampire's collecting life energy. But he has to send it through her to get it up to the collector"" and some other such nonsense.

The filmmakers should have treated the word ""vampire"" as anathema, and avoid any and all direct references to it. Take for instance the aforementioned space shuttle, which anyone familiar with Bram Stoker will identify as an allusion to the Demeter; this is a clever little touch, but it won’t impede any viewer’s enjoyment of the film if the parallelism escapes them. 

My point is that you don’t have to be the boy who cried vampire when the thought is already in pretty much everybody’s mind. There are shades of other works here (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Night of the Living Dead, Solaris, and even Ghostbusters), but the movie doesn’t feel the need to overtly draw attention to them — so why the hard-on for vampires? Other than that, Lifeforce is a satisfying minor diversion for fans of old-school horror.",2022-08-29T22:16:40.061Z,5.0,Lifeforce,1985

LOUISA SAYS:

What…did I….just watch?

Not for the uninitiated or those with weak stomachs, everyone’s favorite polarizing surrealist director Nicolas Winding Refn is back with the lurid, gory, sadistic, and horrifyingly beautiful “The Neon Demon.” This film makes a bold statement about the shallowness of Hollywood and the fashion industry in the most violent, brutal, bloody and disturbing way possible.

The film’s strength is in its breathtaking visuals. Refn once again establishes himself as a true auteur at the top of the visionary food chain. Even if you are one of the many who see him as pompous and pretentious, there’s no denying that few have quite the mastery of the craft of the visual arts as he does. This film belongs in a modern art museum.

It doesn’t matter that there’s not much of a plot: teenage ingénue Jesse (Elle Fanning) moves to Los Angeles to chase her dreams of becoming a model. She soon finds herself living in a sketchy motel with lecherous landlord Hank (Keanu Reeves) and surrounded by the seductive Ruby (Jena Malone), Gigi (Bella Heathcote) and Sarah (Abbey Lee), a pack of shallow, jealous, beauty-obsessed women. It’s hard to evaluate the performances since most consist of nothing more than striking and holding a pose or staring longingly into a mirror, but I do think that Reeves has one of the greatest (if small) roles of his career.

There’s no escaping the true debate this movie presents: is this a shrewd feminist manifesto or is it grossly misogynistic? It’s taken me three days to reflect on this and I’ve decided that it sways towards the former rather than the latter.

First, the film celebrates the female form; the women in the film are beautiful set dressings, designed to be admired (and not treated solely as sexual objects). Yes, the women are one-dimensional but at the same time, that works as a harsh criticism of the narcissism that’s so prevalent in the fashion industry. Refn also artfully expresses the malice that is sometimes deeply hidden in the female psyche. The film is insightful too: women have a dark side and sometimes we do feel like we are in a girl-eat-girl world (a phrase that the film takes a bit too literally).

Refn’s hypnotic signature is all over this stylish, elegantly violent film. Cinematographer Natasha Braier adds a disturbing hallucinatory effect while Cliff Martinez lends a thumping, ear-splitting, ominous score that reflects the overall atmosphere of insanity.

As with the director’s other films (“Drive,” “Only God Forgives“), there are plenty of scenarios that seem to be present with the sole intent to shock, offend or disgust. (Do we really need an extended scene of lesbian necrophilia? I guess you can argue the point, but the scene goes on a bit too long to make it seem relevant to the plot or characters). The extreme last act feels more like a pointless gross-out than a thoughtful commentary think piece. I think this is a good place to mention that this film is a very, very hard ‘R’ rating; I am surprised it’s not NC-17.

“The Neon Demon” isn’t your run-of-the-mill art house film; it’s so far beyond the art house that it’s in another dimension.

MATT SAYS:

A teenage runaway from Sandusky, Ohio steps off a bus into the glittering lights of Hollywood. All of her friends back home tell her that she’s destined to be a star, and she believes them. But Hollywood does not bestow fame and fortune without a price. First it will take her innocence, then it will take all that remains.

So is the story of “The Neon Demon,” the new film by auteur Nicolas Winding Refn (“Drive,” “Only God Forgives”). Elle Fanning is Jesse, the underage runaway that has been lured to Los Angeles by the whispered promises of becoming a famous model. She meets up with another innocent who was been lured to the city: photographer Dean (Karl Glusman), whose attempts at emulating the art he sees in Hollywood through pictures are met with sneering ridicule as “amateurish.” Dean hasn’t sold his soul, and those who have have nothing but contempt for him.

Jesse, on the other hand, makes the bargain readily: after being paraded before harshly appraising eyes and being judged a piece of meat worthy of notice, she willingly trades her virtue for empty glamour and attention. After having reborn on the runway, Jesse quickly learns that she has still not given enough: people continue to want more from her, and what they want she isn’t willing to give.

“The Neon Demon” is not for everyone. It’s not even for most. Even if you enjoyed “Drive,” you may find yourself frustrated and your patience tried by this movie. There is much to appreciate, but you will be challenged in doing so. In this film, Winding Refn has made an art piece that must be assessed, considered, and deconstructed. Those who are literal-minded will likely find their patience tried: the story isn’t about what’s happening on the surface, it’s about what’s happening underneath. You must watch, listen, and observe carefully.

One additional word of warning: “The Neon Demon” is highly disturbing and will upset many casual viewers. Apart from its gore and physical violence, the film pushes boundaries HARD. Terrible things are either shown or implied. I can’t for the life of me understand why the studio and theater chains thought that this was an appropriate film to release in nearly 800 theaters nationwide. One can imagine that of the few audience members who didn’t walk out during the first 20 minutes ran for the exits at its offscreen implication of child abuse.

If you’re still reading this review and haven’t been dissuaded yet, I recommend that you see this movie. It’s one of the most interesting discussion pieces in recent memory and it’s not one that I will soon forget.

It started off very well and in the half mark, it completely lost. In the initial part, it looked like a normal film and then I think even the writer does not know what could happen, they just improvised with whatever they had. Writing was totally messed up. When they had the great characters, it becomes nothing in the end. I'm not a fan of this director, and all his films are average, but this one is the worst among them.

I'm not an art film hater, though I hate wasting scenes without any developments and this one had many like them. If you trim them all out, the overall film is around 45 minutes. The rest of the film was just music, colourful lights, and sometimes totally idle, which definitely drag the viewers to the boredom.

Whenever there was a scene with the story, like dialogues and developments, I thought it was going well. But then those useless, dialogueless segments turned me off. Especially the conclusion was absolutely crap. Elle was good, like a character made for her. Keanu Reeve was useless, his addition was just a marketing strategy that did not click.

This is the story of a teen girl aspiring to be a model, but surrounded by the jealousy people because of her fast growth. How it all goes between them and in the fashion world is what the film talks. The film is watchable, but mostly the second half onwards it gets boring. In the end, I don't think anyone would be satisfied completely with their watch, maybe very, very few, but if you consider the majority, this does not deserve to be suggested.

What if superman was a bad guy? That's the premise Brightburn is built upon. 

To my mind its a more mature concept than the traditional good guy Superman. It makes sense on a certain level too. A superior being would inevitably assert its superiority over lesser beings. That's how evolution and predator/prey relationships tend to work.

Whether you agree with my Darwinian assumptions or not, this is a decent horror sci fi film. There's a sense of the comfortable and familiar family dynamic being turned on its head. The innocent, much loved, adopted son, transformed into something so overwhelming powerful and ruthlessly destructive, that even his parents come to fear him.

531309,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

Brightburn is one of those few movies throughout the year that can grab everyone’s attention solely due to its premise. In a world where the superhero genre is oversaturated with almost a comic-book-based film each month, the Gunn family delivers an unique concept that I don’t think it was ever explored this way. “What if Superman was evil?” is an idea that can be developed through so many different ways, depending on the director and screenwriters’ approach. David Yarovesky clearly drew inspiration from Zack Snyder’s version (Man of Steel), and that’s where the movie is best: in exploring the vast and interesting possibilities that a screenplay like this can pursue.

Usually, when someone writes something along the lines of “it felt like two movies”, it’s not a good sign. Brightburn is a dark, mysterious and suspenseful film during the first half, but then it pretty much transforms itself into a horror-slasher flick, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I firmly believe that no audience member (and I would even dare write critics as well) will leave the theater completely satisfied or entirely disappointed. If you expected the Gunn family to delve deep into Superman’s mythology and explore some twisty paths, they do rely on classic scenes to show how it all could have been if “Clark Kent” wasn’t a nice boy.

If you were expecting a movie closer to the horror genre, the last half of the film offers some good sequences. However, that’s when the movie loses what made me go watch it in the first place. It’s a very short film and it ends in a way that leaves me wanting more. The big problem here is that it’s likely not going to get a sequel, and it could have easily added extra 20-30 minutes to deliver a more fulfilled story.

Production-wise, having in mind its low budget, it looks remarkably great. Some good moments of gorgeous cinematography, and beautiful wide shots. The jump scare sequences of the second half aren’t nearly as effective as they could be, but at least the editing throughout the entire runtime is seamless. With a few more creative and entertaining scenes, Brightburn could have been a lot more menacing and scarier. I only remembered it was R-rated once the first bloody and quite violent moment occurs, and these specific moments are definitely eye-opening, gruesome and horrifying, even though it gets too over-the-top a couple of times.

Elizabeth Banks (Tori Breyer) delivers a notable performance, as well as David Denman (Kyle Breyer). Their characters have a compelling backstory, and they actually have a well-developed script. They don’t make dumb or irrational decisions, like the generic horror characters that we all recognize. Jackson A. Dunn (Brandon) is pretty good as the evil Superman, even if his performance ends up being too monotonous for me. Looking at the overall feedback from both critics and audience, this seems to be part of those rare films each year which I enjoy a bit more than most people.

All in all, Brightburn doesn’t take off powerfully like Superman, but it’s still able to fly for a bit. With good performances, remarkable production design, and an adequate use of its R-rating, the Gunn family delivers an incredibly captivating concept which is explored through an interesting yet unfulfilling screenplay. The second half turns the movie into a pure slasher flick, which might positively affect some viewers, but for me it took away what was really entertaining. The ending is just a taste of what the film could have been and it’s disappointing that it doesn’t explore its fantastic idea more in-depth, but the final feeling about the movie isn’t too bad either.

531309,Gimly,"Given that the premise of the movie is pretty much entirely ""What if Superman was a dick?"" (something that has already been explored pretty thoroughly by DC themselves) I did not expect so much of the focus of the film to be taken up by the family dynamix inherent in the difficulties of parenting.

A pretty mismarketed movie I think. Presented in trailers initially to be a sort of a twist on the superhero genre, and as we got closer to the release of the film, to be a Scary Supes movie, who _Brightburn_ should really be targetting is gorehounds, because it's their avenue in which it most excels.

Even taking that into account though, and seeing it again almost a decade after that first time, I still honestly believe that _The Strangers_ is a good movie, with some pretty genuinely creepy elements.

Liv Tyler does a fine job here, but for most of the time she is alone in the house, and the movie becomes quite repetitive after a while. Once we get to the killers, most people were so excited about the reason, they did all this. Because 'Kristen' was home! Seriously? Who would have thought? Isn't that the same reason, why 'Jason Voorhees' kills people all around 'Camp Crystal Lake'? Because they are there? But I get it. The point is, that the killers have no other motivation than just to attack random people. There is no desire for money or jewelery... just the pure lust to take lives. But that is a motivation, most serial killers have, and therefore it doesn't seem all that special. When the movie becomes bloody towards the end, I really loved it though. It is nice, to see a movie like this acted by someone, who is as well known as Liv Tyler, and also Scott Speedman was totally fine. ""The Strangers"" is a fine little home invasion movie, but most certainly it doesn't deserve this extreme hype.",2019-08-24T16:14:33.368Z,7.0,The Strangers,2008

""Day Shift is one of the most pleasant surprises of the year!

As expected, it doesn't reinvent the wheel - formulaic screenplay and paper-thin characters - but the care and dedication involved in the stunt choreography, minimal use of CGI, and extraordinary camerawork (Toby Oliver) make this project packed with action - sometimes even too much - one of the most entertaining vampire movies of the last decade.

Jamie Foxx serves well enough as the badass protagonist in J. J. Perry's first feature film - the former stuntman impresses in such a way that he could easily become a well-recognized director within the action genre.

The action and fight sequences near John Wick-level choreography (which is not surprising since Chad Stahelski is involved) and the world built by Day Shift is intriguing and worth further exploration in future films.

The action scenes, when there needs to be action, are good.  There is a good flow from scene to scene which staves off that dreaded ""grade B film"" feel.  

The comedy is good and not overly done or cheesy.  I liked the sector chief, he was funny for being the grimey-boss.  And Snoop Dogg was okay in the same laid back way he is. I still believe he fit the role of Jimmy Bones a lot better; though that movie was definitely for the $5 bin at Walmart.  I believe Snoop would do very well as a Master Vamp or boss-guy-sitting-in-the chair type figure.  As long as he doesn't have to emote.  He does very well in line delivery which makes great comedy if you know how to write for him. 

All the actors did well in their roles.  The villaness was good in her role, very arrogant & dispicable (nice on the eyes).  The two vamp-killing brothers were both funny and performed great in their action scenes.  And the speical effects, car chase scenes, and both the Home invasion and Nest scenes were top notch. The studio got their moneies worth when they hired the stuntman company.   
  
I do think they went a little hard with the ""wimpy"" sidekick thing.  I didn't expect what happened to Franco's character to happen.  I thought maybe he'd get his act togther when the circumstances got intense, but the writers took him in another direction that suprisingly (though not terribly original) made sense with the story.  
And I'm not sure WHY, but I keep getting Dave Franco and Zac Efron confused for one another...? (maybe it's the eyebrows)  Franco has been in a number of teen movies and blockbusters...sorta kinda.  I liked the _Fright Night_ re-make, _Neighbors 1 & 2_,(despite Seth Rogan being poison since the Santa Inc. debacle) and the _Now You See Me 1 & 2_ movies.  He's not terrible.  He did well for his character (and props to his stuntman) in this movie. 

As I said before, this is a good vampire movie.  It's not exactly _Fright Night_, or _30 Days of Night_, but definitely holds its own.  If I had to give it similarity by comparison, then I would say it leans more toward _Dusk til Dawn_, than anything else.

9725,Wuchak,"***Serious retread of the first film with some differences***

I'm fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise even though I’m not a gorehound and only occasionally watch slasher flicks. It has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young people in a fun camp-type environment in the woods; the presence of an unstoppable killer, who increasingly becomes a hideous monster over the course of the series, adds an air of danger and suspense. Include scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise.

Released in 1981, one year after the first film, ""Part II"" is basically a retread with different characters, a different killer and a different camp on the same lake, not far from ""Camp Blood,"" i.e. Camp Crystal lake. In reality, the film was shot on an entirely different location; specifically Kent, Connecticut.

It's interesting how none of the films were shot at the same location even though, typically, the location in the story is the general vicinity of Camp Crystal Lake. The locations of the films in the series include northern New Jersey (I), Connecticut (II), Southern Cal (III, IV, V & IX), Georgia (VI), Alabama (VII), British Columbia (VIII & XI), New York City (VIII), Toronto (X & XI) and Texas (XII).

It's the camp-like settings of most of the franchise and the unrelenting monster that is Jason Voorhees that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.

Concerning the tone, the first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the series introduced a campy element in Part III, which plagued several subsequent entries (V, VI, IX & X) until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway; still, I prefer the serious tone. Speaking of which, the only thing questionable about the first film, as far as realism goes, is how the killer is able to throw an adult corpse through a window or hang a body from a door, etc. But I suppose these things can be attributed to the powerful psycho Voorhees gene (or the demon thing disclosed in 1993’s “Jason Goes to Hell”).

Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some chilling atmospherics, some of the others as well, but, with the exception of the 2009 reboot, I don't find these movies particularly scary. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not scary. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes. There are numerous jump-scares, of course, but that's not what I'm talking about.

Part II doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 87 minutes. It introduces the adult Jason Voorhees, but he's noticeably smaller in stature and more human than in later sequels. A couple of times the main protagonist, Ginny (Amy Steel), is able to deter him fairly easily (like opening a car door or kicking him in the groin). Speaking of Ginny, she's a fine heroine in the manner of Alice in the first film and Pam in Part V. Kirsten Baker plays the requisite hottie, Terry, and the filmmakers don’t fail to highlight her beauty. Unfortunately, the ambiguity of the ending is inexplicable.

GRADE: A-

(If you wonder why I rate a film like this so highly, I'm grading it according to what it is: a slasher flick. No genre is beyond redemption or above contempt and this one delivers the goods).",2019-07-11T18:24:50.952Z,8.0,Friday the 13th Part 2,1981

2018 was a disappointing year for me. A lot of letdowns regarding my most anticipated movies, and not enough surprises throughout the year. 2019, on the other hand, has been quite interesting. Most blockbusters have resonated with me, and they’ve been my favorite films to watch so far (Avengers: Endgame, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, Us, Glass). Additionally, original low-budget flicks have also caught my eye, and I’ve been enjoying them as well, even if they’re no masterpieces (Greta, Long Shot). Although, I had some bad experiences as well (Dark Phoenix, Hellboy, Godzilla: King of the Monsters). 

Crawl, which I honestly expected just to be a cliche-filled silly horror movie, joins this last group, and it’s on par with Long Shot as the best surprise of 2019, until now. First of all, this is not a typical horror film, at least having in mind the last few examples of the genre. People might go in expecting something along the lines of Annabelle Comes Home, but with alligators, so I might as well moderate those thoughts. I wouldn’t even place it in that genre, even though disaster-horror isn’t exactly a bad description. It’s definitely a suspense movie, almost like a survival-thriller. Haley and Dave have to fight for their lives in a race against both a hurricane and fatal predators, so I wouldn’t generally put this in the horror genre. Moving on …

I love this type of films, you know that. Suspenseful, claustrophobic sequences, straightforward plot, and set in (mostly) just one location. You might think that since it’s only one place to shoot and it’s such a simple concept, it’s easier overall, but it couldn’t be more distant from the truth. With high-budget, multiple-location movies, directors and screenwriters can hide their technical flaws with tremendous VFX or huge set pieces. In one location, especially such a small one like a modest house, there’s no hiding. If you want to deliver an entertaining and captivating story, you have to write an enthralling screenplay. If you want to provide scary and efficient jump scare scenes, you need to show some creativity and prove you’re a talented filmmaker.

Alexandre Aja, who doesn’t exactly has a remarkable filmography, showcases that even with such a simplistic and short idea, it’s possible to be as or more fun than a massive blockbuster. Less than 20 minutes into the film, and we’re on. There’s enough backstory and characterization of the main protagonist for the audience to not only care about Haley but understand what skills she has that will help her survive what comes next. I love small details like zooming in on her locking a door, closing a window, moving a piece of furniture … Every shot has meaning because it will affect the plot later on. Aja is not shooting something “just because”, and that’s a skill that a lot of directors struggle to have nowadays since they feel that the runtime needs to be close to the two-hour mark.

After so many dumb, cliche, and horribly performed jump scare sequences in previous horror flicks from this year, I finally got to watch a movie where the director knows how to truly scare people, and make them jump out of their chairs. There are no loud soundtrack noises to make you screech. There are no demons or monsters in front of the screen, screaming like crazy. I was at the edge of my seat for more than a couple of times, and I genuinely got scared on some particular moments, where the surprise factor (Aja doesn’t follow the cheap timings of most horror scenes) and the creativity behind the camera were top notch.

Obviously, the VFX and overall production design aren’t mind-blowing. The alligators look pretty real, and that was the main goal, so mission accomplished. Also, being Rated-R helps the film to deliver great alligator attacks with tons of blood, and the injuries our characters have to deal with are pretty gnarly and disgusting (that’s a compliment). Filming in water is extremely hard, especially in such a confined space. However, Aja and his crew were able to produce a movie where you can understand everything that’s going on for the entire runtime. 

Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper deliver great performances and show amazing chemistry. Their characters have enough development, even if they don’t have that imaginative scripts. Crawl is one of those films where I can’t point out a preeminent issue with it because it’s good at every aspect. I mean, sure, there are a couple of rare moments of extreme survival, where we might think “he/she should be dead”, but it’s such a fun and entertaining time at the theater that we can let go of one or two over-the-top scenes. It’s not like The Meg, where every single moment is unrealistic as hell. The success of the fictional part of a fiction movie depends on its realistic foundation and limits. If these aren’t well-established, then the film will be all over the place, and its viewers won’t know what to believe or not.

All in all, Crawl is one of 2019’s best surprises, and I definitely recommend to see it in theaters. With compelling leads and a simple concept, Alexandre Aja delivers an entertaining, suspenseful, claustrophobic, and technically creative movie. Finally, someone who knows how to handle a camera, and provide genuinely scary jump scare sequences. Hopefully, this can catapult Kaya Scodelario to grab a bigger role on a more impactful film. I can’t point out any “flaws”, it’s simply a “good movie”. With such a low-budget, give a chance to this one, and watch it instead of a massive blockbuster that will probably leave you disappointed with the numerous cliches and the extreme focus on silly action or huge set pieces as a replacement for a good story. Good job, Paramount!

511987,TheArtyDans,"Crawl is a medium budget creature horror film that’s more Bait than Jaws – but with the added back drop of a massive hurricane. As if our characters weren’t already in enough danger.

Is Crawl a “so bad its good” movie, or a “so bad you should avoid it” movie? Read on to find out.

Set in Florida during a category 5 hurricane, Crawl tells the story of Haley and her father Dave, played by Barry Pepper. After receiving a frantic phone call from her sister, Haley goes on the hunt to find her father who is trapped in their old house as the hurricane approaches. 

Unbeknownst to Haley, the overflow drain has been breached by Alligators, and their about to make Haley’s rescue mission a whole lot more difficult.

And if the gators don’t get Haley and her dad, the rising hurricane waters will.

I don’t know much about Alligators or Hurricanes, but I do like to think I know something about logic. And that is something that is sorely lacking in most characters in this film. Even the dog.

A series of unfortunate events conspire to make the rescue almost a futile effort. And the missing logic from our characters only add to the frustration to us, as the viewer. 

Where should I start? First and foremost, I want to understand why neither Haley or Dave ever tried to smash out the weak looking brick work patterns on the basement wall and then crawl out of the new hole to safety? It doesn’t look like the bricks would need much in the way of a good whack to break open – and considering there were tools in the basement, including the shovel that Dave uses later on to half-decapitate a gator, this bit makes no sense to me. Now I realise two things – 1 is that the open brick patterns serves a purpose to flood the basement – but in reality it’s the first thing anyone would think to smash open. And 2 – if they did do that, then I realise we’d have a short film. But then the writers could have had more fun for the next hour putting Haley and Dave in more incredible and hard to survive scenarios. So there’s a missed opportunity.

The gators that are stuck into basement with Haley and Dave also don’t seem to be those of the killing variety – its either that or the skin of our two characters is so tough that these gators just can’t bite through them. I’m not gator expert, but I am pretty sure if one gets his whole mouth on your arm – he is probably going to bite your whole arm off, and not just leave a minor bite mark. Funny thing is we know these two gators are indeed killers, as one of them does eat the police man who comes to rescue them. 

Also following up on the theme of me not being an expert on gators – one thing has me puzzled. Do gators kill for sport, or because they’re hungry? I can’t work that out based on this movie. 

And in something that really shocked me for an American movie – it took over an hour until we saw the first gun. That has to be some kind of record for an American horror thriller movie?

But its not all bad – because there are quite a few laugh out loud moments in this movie to lighten up the mood.

I really liked the way Haley traps one of the gators in the shower. That’s both clever and utterly ridiculous – that a flimsy piece of shower glass could be strong enough to hold back a gator that wants to kill.

I also liked the nod to the Purge movies when the siren started just as the eye of the storm was passing through. It almost felt like a both a warning to all humans, and a sign to all gators that they could begin their hunt.

If you go into this movie realising that its not meant to be taken seriously, then its an enjoyable ride that will only briefly have you jumping in your seat over the scares and light gore. For a movie about gators hunting humans, it is surprisingly light on the gore – but then that’s what happens when Hollywood makes horror movies for teen audiences.

And there in lies the problem with this movie and someone like me watching it. It not aimed or marketed at me, and maybe not even at you. It’s a forgettable popcorn flick in the same vein as Bait, but not as fun – at least that had gore to go with its killer sharks.",2019-10-14T00:02:54.072Z,2.0,Crawl I,2019

When she gets there, her father is hurt and the house is surrounded by hungry and furious alligators. To make it worse, the storm causes a flooding and all this water just makes the hunt easier for the gators.

The movie has good visual effects, but the plot armor is the most absurd one I have seen in years. Against everybody else, the gators are relentless and super-effective man-killing machines, tearing anyone in pieces before they are even able to see what is attacking them. The protagonists, however, suffer only mild scratches from gator bites that would at least result in an arm or leg being torn off.

Crawl is different from my usual favorite stupid shark or alligator creature features because this is not a so-bad-it’s-good ridiculous movie. Instead, Crawl is a well-done creature survival thriller that creates high anxiety with claustrophobic environments filled with enraged starving alligators. Kaya Scodelario and Barry Pepper play a father and daughter trapped in a flooding basement in the middle of a hurricane that has become the new home of some hungry crocs. The serious tone and high quality of Crawl would be comparable to The Shallows making this an excellent film as much about survival and growth as the alligators looking for dinner.

511987,CinemaSerf,"Ok, so there are more holes in this plot than in an entire factory of Swiss cheese and it does, quite literally, level up from the basement to the roof - but I actually quite enjoyed it. Accomplished swimmer “Haley” (Kaya Scodelario) is worried about her dad (Barry Pepper) who isn’t answering his phone and there’s a hurricane coming. With the roads gridlocked, she heads off to find out what’s what at his home and next thing we know, both are trapped in his flooded out basement and there is one very hungry alligator marauding about looking for some “Haley” flavoured snacks. With the relentless rain pouring down, the winds blowing and the lightning lighting up the sky, she knows that she is going to do all of the work here as her father is injured and help isn’t coming any time soon. Fortunately, her legs seem as impervious to it’s jaws as it’s eyes appear to be to her stabbing them with a screwdriver, so we know that this adventure is going to go all the way as the waters rise, beasties get hungrier and angrier and the humans have to use all of their ingenuity to survive. Will they? Well, no I don’t suppose there is really a lot of actual jeopardy here but the photography gets up close and personal with the scaly fiend and Scodelario manages with far less hysterical shrieking than we have might have expected. It does what it says on the can, nothing more nor less and if you are looking for something claustrophobic, slightly menacing and quickly paced then this ought to fit the bill.",2025-11-16T14:02:50.587Z,6.0,Crawl I,2019

60304,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This is a movie which you watch for the action and the special effects and pretty much nothing else. As such it is a excellent movie. The original story of Hansel & Gretel is essentially only used to boot this movie. The movie itself plays out when Hansel & Gretel are adult witch hunters.

The movie is pretty much action all the way. It is fairly violent and goory action at that. It is not a movie for the kids. To me this is an advantage. I do not think I would have liked it as much if they had dumbed it down to a standard PG-rated Hollywood creation. I really enjoyed the hard-ass Hansel & Gretel duo kicking witch ass in so many way.

The special effects are not bad and the medieval yet kind of modern weaponry that Hansel & Gretel swings around are quite cool looking. Not very believable perhaps but then neither are witches so… The witches themselves are also fairly cool. Especially the witch-gathering near the end of the movie is indeed a grim (ha ha) collection of freaky creatures.

I was not too thrilled about the idiot law keeper. His utter stupidity bugged me throughout the entire movie. I really whished they would have dragged out the end for him a bit more. Well he did meet a suitable end at least.

Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. If you though this was to be “just” a Hansel & Gretel movie the you are probably going to be disappointed. I knew more or less what I went for so I was just enjoying myself. I was surprised at the level of gore, exploding heads, troll-squished humans etc… but, as I said above, I think it was a good thing that they did let it be done in the way the producer/director obviously intended for it to be made.",2018-01-11T19:42:59.715Z,8.0,Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters,2013
60304,Wuchak,"***Kick axx continuation of the sylvan fairy tale about slaying diabolical witches***

In Medieval Germany, Hansel & Gretel (Jeremy Renner & Gemma Arterton) are now adults and formidable witch slayers, not to mention considered heroes in the community. When numerous children turn-up missing, they trace the problem to an unholy celebration orchestrated by a grand witch (Famke Janssen). Fetching Pihla Viitala plays a redhead villager accused of witchcraft.

""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" (2013) is a dark fantasy/action/comedy/horror that takes the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm and envisions events about twenty years later. Imagine the excellent “Season of the Witch” (2011) meshed with the fantasy elements of the fable and you’d have a good idea of this movie. “Dracula Untold” (2014) and “Snow White and the Huntsman” (2012) are good contemporary associations, but “Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters” is noticeably superior.

This movie just kicks total axx from beginning to end with Gemma jaw-dropping as the take-no-sheet heroine and Renner rising to the challenge. The witches are ee-vil and worthy of nothing other than immediate slaughter, which is basically the siblings’ modus operandi. There’s a lot of thrilling action and gore, some of it so over-the-top it’s amusing; there’s even a terrible troll. And the movie LOOKs great. If you like dark woodsy adventure and don’t mind fantasy, don’t miss out on this excellent film.   

The film is doesn’t overstay its welcome at 1 hour, 28 minutes; and was fittingly shot completely in Germany.

If you are familiar with the fairy tale, you will know that ""Hansel"" (Jeremy Renner) and sister ""Gretel"" (Gemma Arterton) were enticed to the house made of sweets by an evil witch. On the menu, luckily they are able to turn the tables on her and it is her who goes into the oven rather than them! Ten years on, and our siblings are legendary and regularly summoned to rid other villages of their menaces. It's on one such mission the they discover that an impending Blood Moon is going to empower an whole coven of witches who have already stolen a dozen innocent children to use as ingredients in a broth. Can they thwart this (actually quite appealing) plan? Well along the way they make some friends and some foes before quite a spectacular, if I felt rather disappointing, denouement. There is an hint of chemistry between Renner and a distinctly underwhelming Arterton, Famke Janssen fares fine as the nasty ""Muriel"" and when it works, it's quite a pacy and enjoyable fantasy. There's way too much dialogue though, and when we start to delve into their past, I started to delve into the Maltesers. It's fine, and actually does look better on a big screen as the cinematography and visual effects are good enough.

1577,RalphRahal,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) takes the franchise in a more action-heavy direction, but in doing so, it loses some of what made the first movie work. The story is straightforward and somewhat interesting, but it lacks any real depth, feeling more like an excuse to string together set pieces rather than a well-developed plot. The horror elements are almost an afterthought, making the zombies feel out of place in what plays more like an over-the-top action movie.

The directing choices are questionable, with excessive shaky cam and overblown shots that make certain action scenes harder to follow. Slow motion is a nice touch, but it’s used so frequently that it feels more like a gimmick than a stylistic choice. That said, the cinematography does have its moments, particularly in a few key sequences. The introduction of Nemesis is handled well, even if his overall presence in the movie could have been stronger. Milla Jovovich remains the highlight, delivering her signature mix of badassery and effortless style while taking on enemies with superhuman agility.

The script is basic, filled with cheesy dialogue that doesn't add much weight to the story. The soundtrack keeps the aggressive, industrial vibe from the first film, but the overall execution of the movie feels uneven. While it has entertaining moments, it doesn’t match the balance of action, horror, and sci-fi that made the original so engaging.

11449,Wuchak,"_**That iconic creepy house on Long Island**_

A newlywed couple moves into a shoreline house on Long Island with their three little kids. The house was the scene of a mass killing a year earlier but the parents (James Brolin & Margot Kidder) didn’t think it mattered and, besides, it enabled them to purchase the homestead at a much reduced price. Then strange things start happening.  

""The Amityville Horror"" (1979) was arguably the best haunted house movie up to that point in time and was hugely successful at the box office, inspiring a gazillion sequels, remakes and documentaries. There are similarities to ""The Shining"" (1980): Both movies were based on books published in 1977, but the film version of ""The Amityville Horror"" was released a year prior to “The Shining” and was based on the supposedly true story of what happened to the Lutz family whereas Stephen King’s novel was purely fictional.

The 2005 remake with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George deviates even further from the book and is a brisker, more modern version of the story. Yet this classic version still works as a moody and mysterious drama with horrific touches. Unlike the remake, the movie takes its time to establish and develop the characters and I appreciated this; for instance, Mr. Lutz's employee (Michael Sacks) and his spiritually curious girlfriend (Helen Shaver), as well as the two priests (Rod Steiger and Don Stroud).

Gene Siskel criticized it on the grounds that it wasn’t enjoyable. Seriously? Since when are horror flicks supposed to be enjoyable? This is a realistic drama with some creepy paranormal things thrown on top, based on an allegedly true account. I don’t think the filmmakers were shooting for “enjoyable.” That said, underneath the darkness the picture has a good, warm heart.

Was the actual Lutz’s account true or not? They seemed to have experienced some troubling things at the house during their month-long stay and passed a Polygraph by two top polygraph experts but, assuming their story wasn’t concocted for profit (which many believe was the case), the events were certainly amped-up for the book & movie for the purpose of an entertaining tale. By the way, the large Dutch Colonial house still stands in Amityville, albeit the exterior was remodeled and hence the two distinctive windows appear standard.

The film runs 1 hour, 57 minutes and was mostly shot in New Jersey as follows: Toms River (house), Point Pleasant (church), Georgian Court University in Lakewood (meeting with the hooded priest), Ocean County and Scotch Plains; as well as indoor scenes done at MGM Studios in Culver City, California; plus some shots done in Long Island, Connecticut and Glendale, California.

""Critters"" (1986) takes the basic premise of 50’s alien-invasion flicks, like “The Blob” or “War of the Worlds,” but meshes it with the tone and furry creatures of “Gremlims” from two years prior. The Kansas farmhouse and small town setting recalls teen Clark Kent’s situation in “Superman” (1978). The movie expertly walks the balance beam between fun & amusing and deadly serious creature feature. The vibe is similar to ""Neon Maniacs"" from the same year, but this is superior, as well as superior to “Gremlims.” 

Dee Wallace is a highlight as the wife/mother, never looking better, while Nadine Van der Velde is worth a mention as the brunette daughter. On the other side of the gender spectrum, a young Billy Zane shows up as the latter’s beau while Terrence Mann has a memorable dual role, not to mention impressively wrote the catchy song for the soundtrack, “Power of the Night.”

I like how this isn’t a typical alien-visitation flick. The addition of the galactic bounty hunters adds an interesting new dimension, a concept that would be ripped off the next year by “The Hidden.”

It runs 1 hour, 26 minutes, and was shot in Valencia, Santa Clarita, which is a 45-minutes drive northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

The titular aliens do look the part though, even all these years later. The practical effects are nice, that house explosion is particularly great.

Scott Grimes is the actor that stood out most to me whilst watching. I do like how the kid is written, usually in these sorta films they tend to be only annoyingly bratty but here there are a couple of moments where you can see Brad's good; e.g. with Charlie, or with his mum. A nice touch, I thought.

It is a movie that I'd say lacks consistent thrill, but all in all it's one I'll still be considering as passable.

A gang of modern day pirates board a luxurious ocean liner intent on looting it of everything.

Apparently some strange sea creatures have run amok and the pirates themselves are now next on the menu! 

""Deep Rising"" doesn't have any delusion about what it wants to be, it was marketed as a raging ""B"" movie man versus beast gun fest, and that is exactly what it is - with tongue firmly in its bloody cheek. When the tag line reads ""Full Scream Ahead"" then you get the impression it's not a film to be remotely taken seriously. 

Written and directed by Stephen Sommers (""The Mummy""), ""Deep Rising"" is a blend of ""Alien"", ""Poseidon Adventure"" and ""Under Siege"", all built around the ""Ten Little Indians"" structure. Blood spurts and quips are dealt, and the film isn't found wanting in the good old ""it's behind you"" department.

A band of ruthless hijackers seize the world’s richest cruise ship in the South China Sea, but no one’s on board. Something mysterious & terrifying from the great depths got there before them. Treat Williams and Kevin J. O'Connor play the protagonists who inadvertently transport the hijackers while Famke Janssen plays a survivor on the vessel. Meanwhile Anthony Heald is on board as the shady owner of the ship and Wes Studi plays one of the key thugs. 	 

“Deep Rising” (1998) is an action/horror that mixes “The Poseidon Adventure” (1972) with “Alien Resurrection” (1997), but encumbers it with camp and a creature that does wildly unbelievable things. While the monster is interesting in some respects, it’s actually not original. It’s a glaring rip-off of the Celestial Man’s true form revealed in the 1974 issue of Marvel Comics’ The Defenders #14.  

Nevertheless this is a fun, thrilling adventure if you can roll with the above hitches. The cast is diverse and spirited. Yet this doesn’t change that it’s basically a B-type of dumb adventure/horror flick. It just cost 30 times as much as the usual B sci-fi and bombed at the box office. Meanwhile the feminine department is limited to Famke Janssen and she never did much for me (but she’s a’right), although Una Damon has a small role.

Stephen King’s Cujo was brought to the screen and met with indifference back in 1983, yet it’s aged surprisingly well and comes out as one of the better “mad animal” movies that followed in the wake of Jaws.

A big cuddly St. Bernard dog is bitten on the nose by a bat, cops a serious bout of Hydrophobia and then terrorises anyone in its path. Which spells bad news for Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace) and her young son Tad (Danny Pintauro), who have the misfortune to be stuck in a battered old Pinto that has broken down in Cujo’s territory.

Lewis Teague directs with no little skill here, wringing out pot loads of tension and inserting genuine moments of terror as mother and son literally fight for their lives. There’s a school of thought that the film’s first half could have been trimmed, for this is the area that defines the Trenton’s as a family. 

Donna has been having an affair and her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) has found out, so for forty minutes we are investing in family strife and foundation building of the key characters. This is judged perfectly, because once Cujo is unleashed on Donna and Tad, it throws up a number of emotional connections to not only the humans, but also the dog as well.

Wallace and Pintauro are excellent, providing the film with its beating heart as they prove to be a believable mother & son pairing. Teague meanwhile uses some invention with his camera work, though never to the detriment of claustrophobic terror. Elements of the source novel have been left out, while the ending – unfortunately in this viewer’s opinion – has been changed, but this is a tightly wound horror and it’s well due re-evaluation in this day and age of franchise sequels and remakes.

Kevin Smith breaks away from his comedic roots to direct and write this religious/political/bigot baiter that lurches from Hostel type madness into a siege of the damned. Starring Melissa Leo, Michael Parks, John Goodman, Michael Angarano, Kerry Bishe and Nicholas Braun, story finds Parks heading up a Christian cult that lures horny youngsters to their place of worship on the promise of sex with an older woman. Of course once the lads get there it’s not long before the truth of the lure is revealed and we are treated to hate spiel by sermon and some unpleasantness from the production code edition of the torture porn play book. 

Red State is an infuriating movie in many ways, but it is never dull and it always remains challenging, even if some of Smith’s sermonising agendas lack cohesion entering the final third of the piece. In fact there are three tonal shifts that don’t make an altogether appetising whole, Smith straining to bridge the gap between satire and horror – cum – thriller. And sadly the climax to all the damaged threads is very anti-climatic. On the major plus side is a cast doing fine work, headed by Goodman, Leo and Parks, the latter getting to play lead dog for a change. It’s impressively shot by Dave Klein and Smith shows flickers of there being a good director in the mix. 

Poor box office and bad reviews upon release inevitably got it tarnished as a bad film. In truth it’s a fascinating failure, but it has merits enough to warrant time spent with it. From Westboro to Waco, stopping briefly for a night in a Hostel, Red State is not easily forgotten once sampled. For better or worse. 6/10",2014-07-14T00:19:14.839Z,6.0,Red State,2011
12526,tmdb28039023,"Possession has been a lifelong preoccupation for William Friedkin. He’s addressed it head-on as both fiction and fact, but Bug sees him take a more oblique route. Here’s the story of a man so thoroughly possessed by paranoia that his delusions are contagious. One demon leaves one body to enter another, but an obsession is Legion.

Every Michael Shannon performance is arguably his best, but this is a film tailor-made for his fascinating idiosyncrasies. Aphid and spastic, his body language stops short of actually turning into a freaking insect.

Ashley Judd, however, has a more challenging role, because not only does she have to sell the transition from sane to crazy, but then she has to catch up with Shannon, go toe-to-toe with him, match his manic intensity — and I’ll be damned if she doesn’t; Judd digs deep and reaches a place of utter darkness and desperation. She stares right into the abyss and doesn’t flinch.

Everybody is in point, though; Friedkin and screenwriter Tracy Letts, pull off the rare double-turn (to use wrestling terminology). Harry Connick Jr., who plays Judd’s character’s abusive ex, is all brawn and no brains, while Shannon starts out helpless and meek (his patented, infallible calm-before-the-storm routine); we begin to dread the seemingly inevitable moment when Connick beats Shannon within an inch of his life, only to end up wishing that the former would slap some sense into the latter.

The only problem with this film is that it builds so much momentum it just can’t help crashing and burning. It’s so climactic that it actually becomes anticlimactic. There’s no resolution, no catharsis. For all its shock and awe, The Exorcist allows itself a hopeful, optimistic coda; Bug lacks such an escape valve.

There's no reason, but after a long due I saw this. I'm pretty impressed with the film's production, but in the end it was an average film for me. James Purefoy was good, but the story needed someone very husky looking actor to play the Solomon. That's what spoiled my watch, other than that I enjoyed most of the film. Because the tone and the pace were excellent, but it was a predictable story.

A savage warrior leading his men somewhere in the Northern Africa, when he's sensing he almost defeated them, comes to know his soul is damned. He escapes there, leaves his all that life behind and looks for a peaceful future. He was born to be a warrior, that's why he left his own kingdom. So in his second chance to rediscover his path, he must achieve the impossible to defeat his opponent.

Full of dark and wet atmosphere really gives that required medieval look. The locations were well used and also the costumes, so if you like films that sets in this era, particularly stunts, then you might enjoy it. But if you ask me, I would say it is just a one time watchable film. Entertainment is guaranteed, but because of something, the film does not not look complete. So recommended for the selected viewers.

32985,John Chard,"If I kill you I am bound for hell. It's a price I shall gladly pay.

Solomon Kane is directed by Michael J. Bassett and Bassett adapts the character of Kane from the magazine character created by Robert E. Howard. It stars James Purefoy, Rachael Hurd-Wood, Pete Postlethwaite and Anthony Wilks. Music is by Klaus Badelt and cinematography by Dan Laustsen.
​
It's early 1600 and English mercenary Solomon Kane (Purefoy) is informed by the Devils Reaper that his wicked ways have damned his soul for eternity. Not wanting to spend eternity with old Nick and all his hellish instruments of torture, Kane escapes and renounces violence and converts to Puritanism - that is until a wicked turn of events in his life sends him on the violent road to redemption.

Solomon Kane was created by pulp writer Robert E. Howard, who would a few years later also create Conan The Barbarian, safe to say then that swords and sorcery was at the time of his life in the 1920s/30s on his mind. It's also safe to say here that if this type of genre swish and swash is not your thing then this will definitely not convert you into being someone who suddenly does. However, fans of such fare are in for a treat, where not for the first time a picture that bombed at the box office - and got a delayed release in The States - has broken free of supposed stinker damnation to become a firm cult favourite to like minded souls.

Kane is our anti-hero, a real hard dude who ends up living by the fight evil with evil mantra. In the hands of Purefoy and his director, Kane is moody personified, the whole film dishing out ladles of brood and dark thematics as religion and dark arts come under the microscope. The action is well choreographed, plenty of blood letting and head loping, accompanied by swivels and lurches. Imagery is potent - such as graveyards and reaper lairs, while Bassett firmly believes in soaking his cast in mud and rags, all for realistic payment.

Some popular actors slot in for some support work, which is a bonus, and although the finale is not without problems (main baddie all to brief, the big showdown likewise), this rounds out as an imaginatively and thrillingly mounted period genre piece. 8/10",2019-02-25T17:17:06.084Z,8.0,Solomon Kane,2009

I don't know Robert E. Howard's literary work very well, but I confess that I don't like “Conan” and I feel that the fantasy genre has seen better days. However, what I saw in this film pleased me: it's good enough to entertain us satisfactorily, but it's not the kind of film we'll want to see more than a handful of times.

Solomon Kane is a mercenary, played by James Purefoy, in a great effort. The actor is truly good for the role: he has enough charisma to give himself the leading role he needs, he is not too old for the character nor does he seem too young. Pete Postlethwaite is also a magnificent addition to the cast as yet another character full of dignity and very likeable. Max von Sydow also provides discreet support. The only person I didn't like very much was Rachel Hurd-Wood: she doesn't have much to do other than being permanently in danger.

The script starts well, with a story about a cruel man who over the years committed looting and crimes, and finally understands that he will go to Hell. From then on he tries to change, but it becomes increasingly clear that this man will have to face his past at some point if he truly wants to redeem himself. This finally happens when he has to defeat an evil wizard. I don't want to say much more, but it's quite easy to see that the big problem with this script is the way in which we easily predict what's going to happen, the predictability of the whole story. This is the film's big problem.

Another problem with this film is the way in which the past was recreated: I didn't feel, on the part of the production, any desire to place the action precisely in time and space. The script, however, required it! It is quite evident that the story takes place around 1650 in the fields of South East England, in Dorset. The construction of the sets, costumes and props simply ignored this whenever they could. The cinematography, for example, is magnificently crafted and presents us with hazy, gloomy and dark landscapes, and semi-ruined places. We have no resemblance to the English countryside, but it is the ideal setting for the dark story that will unfold and creates an atmosphere in a very intelligent way. Anachronistic fighting styles, anachronistic weapons and accessories, clothing that doesn't resemble anything that existed in the past, flintlock pistols whose sound effect resembles that of a revolver... M. J. Bassett makes several mistakes. In return, there is a lot of action, fights for all tastes that give the film a lot of flow and movement, as if it were a music video, and excellent CGI that creates a vast multiplicity of evil creatures.",2023-12-03T22:49:40.223Z,5.0,Solomon Kane,2009

Hobo with a Shotgun is directed by Jason Eisener and written by John Davies. It stars Rutger Hauer, Brian Downey, Gregory Smith, Molly Dunsworth, Robb Wells and Nick Bateman. Music is by Alexander Rosborough and cinematography by Karim Hussain.

A homeless hobo (Hauer) hitches a freight train lift into Hope Town and finds a city imploding with corruption, violence, drugs and sexual deviance. Initially trying to keep out of the way and get on with his meagre existence, the hobo finally cracks and decides he can no longer sit back and watch such lawlessness. Helping himself to a shotgun from the local pawn shop, hobo goes on a one man killing crusade.

Born out of a trailer that accompanied the original full release of Rodriguez/Tarrantino's Grindhouse venture, Hobo with a Shotgun is horror exploitation made with abundant glee. Blending Death Wish like vigilantism with 70s and 80s styled schlock, Jason Eisener has crafted an utterly tasteless, yet wonderfully entertaining piece of cinema. Violence is broad and completely bloody, as heads are exploded, bodies punctured and characters killed in a series of increasingly strange ways, while the characters that inhabit Hope Town are downright nasty and equally as weird. From bully boy Tom Cruise homage brother bastards Ivan & Slick, to a paedophile Santa Claus, and on to The Plague -two metal suited fetish killers sent to take out the hobo - it's welcome to bizarreville for sure.

It's all driven by a great turn from Hauer, who manages to play it with raw and subtle emotion, even as the rage takes control of him and he deals death as surely as he delivers a memorable line. Around him are a bunch of no mark actors, but this works in the films' favour, the material doesn't need star wattage to drive the motors, besides which, you will undoubtedly come out of the film remembering the characters these actors have played rather than the actors in the garbs. 

Shot in suitably lurid Technicolor by Hussain and featuring an on the money score by Rosborough, all the elements for a Grindhouse feature fall into place. This basically does what the title suggests it will, yes it may at times veer towards crassness, and what social comment depth intended gets lost as Eisener gets carried away with the carnage. But under examination this is a whole bunch of fun that's made for adults who remember the movies from a past decade that this homages and parodies with devilish aplomb. 8/10",2019-01-26T18:15:36.079Z,8.0,Hobo with a Shotgun,2011
338947,garethmb,"After four theatrical and six direct-to-video releases “Hellraiser” has been given a reboot as a cinematic release for Hulu.

For those not familiar with the series based on a story by Clive Barker, it involves a cube-shaped puzzle box that when opened summons demons known as Cenobites who demand sacrifices and promise great rewards to those who summon them.

Naturally, their version of rewards is the stuff of nightmares as the line between pleasure and pain for them is even more distorted than their horrific visages leading those who encounter them to plead for death but often face tortures beyond imagination.

The new take on the series stars Odessa A’zion as Riley, a recovering addict who is living with her brother and his boyfriend as well as a roommate. Her brother is concerned over her relationship with her boyfriend as he believes anyone she met in recovery is not stable enough to support her in her times of need.

Desperate for money; Riley is convinced to take objects from an abandoned warehouse but finds only the mysterious puzzle box which she in time is able to reconfigure to one of the various options it is capable of. In doing so, she summons the Cenobites who promptly take her brother which forces Riley and her friends not only to question her sobriety but her sanity as well.

As they attempt to understand the nature of what is happening to them, their investigation leads them to a larger puzzle and encounters with more Cenobites including their leader Pinhead (Jamie Clayton) whose at times cryptic messages can tempt and torment those who try to survive and manipulate the events they find themselves in.

What follows is a mix of tension and gore as personal ambitions, survival, temptation, and base emotions are tempted as the characters attempt to understand a complex and rapidly changing nightmare from which there seems to be no escape.

While the new version does have a slow and more deliberate pace leading up to the finale, it was engaging enough to hold my interest. For me, the theatrical films became at times redundant as they did not advance the mythos as much as up the gore in an attempt to keep the audiences coming. The fact that the last theatrical release had the Director remove his name from the film shows how things had deteriorated too.

The six video releases were hit and miss with Barker no longer being involved and eventually the same for original Pinhead Doug Bradley who no longer wanted to be part of a series where a film was produced in a matter of weeks simply to maintain the rights.

This time around thanks to a good cast and effects along with a story that is true to the mythos yet updated and engaging, the franchise has had a much-needed new direction and it will be interesting to see where it goes next as there are already rumors of a prequel in the works.

Hulu has done well with their recent “Predator” film “Prey” which has invigorated the franchise and this new outing is not only ideal for their format but a fresh step for the franchise.

As you probably know by now, I'm a huge horror fan. An outstanding horror movie is almost always one of the best films of the year for me. I find it frustrating that so many people don't value this genre as much as the others, especially since the general public usually tends to like the more generic narratives, filled with predictable jump scares, and dull stories. Nothing against that, obviously, anyone can like whatever they want! However, when comparing with other genres, horror feels like an outsider, only truly followed by a specific group of people, even though it's been admittedly growing in the last few years.

I didn't expect much from The Lodge, which probably helped me enjoy it as much as I did since it's one of the favorite movies of 2020 so far. It's undoubtedly the least formulaic horror flick in quite a while. It features ingredients that, however, audiences are not that fond of: visual storytelling, slow pace, and almost zero jump scares. The first is incredibly captivating not only due to the clever framing and mise-en-scène but also because the dark atmosphere fills the house in a very ominous manner. Its lack of dialogue throughout the runtime might be a no-go for some people, but I love when films ""show, don't tell"".

The purposefully slow pace is very well-balanced. With the exception of a short period during the second act, where nothing really happens (no new information about story or characters is given to the viewer), every other scene is meaningful either to develop characters or forward the story. The screenplay is structured in a way that never stops being entertaining: something impactful occurs, characters react to it, something important is discovered, and so on. Between the events, the atmosphere never stops being creepy, and the minimal (but efficient) dialogue is remarkably intriguing.

It's a movie that undoubtedly gains a lot from its notable technical attributes. From the astonishing cinematography (Thimios Bakatakis, who has worked with Yorgos Lanthimos in four films) to the exceptional production design, this one-location movie offers a claustrophobic environment elevated by brilliant performances. Riley Keough delivers one of the best performances I've seen from her, creating that perfect balance that makes the viewer question if her character is sane or crazy. The mystery surrounding Grace is partially due to Riley's fantastic interpretation.

Jaeden Martell is really good, and I'm happy that he continues to get great projects to be part of. However, Lia McHugh is the undeniable standout, in my opinion. With just twelve-years-old, Lia gives such a phenomenal display. Her last scene of the film, which she shares with Jaeden, is award-worthy. Both are mind-blowingly compelling during that moment. Impressive performances across the board.

Unfortunately, I do have a few issues regarding the characters. Grace's past is the biggest question mark of the story, and it's left unsatisfyingly ambiguous. The Lodge relies a lot on its visual storytelling, something I absolutely love, but in this particular aspect, I believe a more explicit explanation would have helped the viewer better understand Grace's development. My other problem is related to the kids' motivations, but I have to be very vague due to possible spoilers.

Basically, their actions throughout the movie are justified by something that, while I can partially understand where they're coming from, I can't honestly believe that young children would be able to even think about it, let alone actually doing it seamlessly. This last sentence is the best I can do to describe my issue with these characters. In the end, I have some problems with the characters, but the story boasts some genuinely shocking moments (the first act is brilliant), and an extremely impactful, bold ending.

The Lodge is one of my favorite films of 2020 so far. However, it possesses features that usually don't conquer the general public. For some people, its visual storytelling might be too ambiguous, its slow pace might be too boring, and the lack of jump scares might cause damage entertainment-wise. Fortunately, I love every single one of these aspects. This atmospheric horror flick is elevated by its outstanding technical attributes, especially Thimios Bakatakis' bizarre cinematography, as well as the claustrophobic production design. Boasting an impressive lead performance from Riley Keough and incredible displays from Jaeden Martell and Lia McHugh (standout with just twelve-years-old), the Austrian directing duo (Severin Fiala, Veronika Franz) delivers one of the least generic horror movies in quite some time. Still, the three main characters deserved better development and more transparent motivations. I recommend it for true horror fans, but if you prefer a more ""active"" horror flick (and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that), maybe it's better to skip this one.

_The Lodge_ is a 2019 movie directed by the same duo that made the most excellent German language film _Goodnight Mommy_ which rates as one of my favourite movies of recent years. So how do they go with this English language horror thriller? Well first of all, let’s hear what _The Lodge_ is about:

_When a father is forced to abruptly depart for work, he leaves his children at their holiday home in the care of his new girlfriend, Grace. Isolated and alone, a blizzard traps them inside the lodge as terrifying events summon specters from Grace's dark past._

This movie suuuuuuuuucks. It drags, it's boring, and the ultimate explanation of everything relied on such a stretch of the imagination that it made me chuckle. About an hour in, not much had really happened, we hadn't really learned anything new about the characters, and there's so much telegraphing that when all the stuff starts going down, none of it is a surprise.

This is mediocrity at its finest, and I'm kinda annoyed that I paid actual money to rent this on YouTube.",2020-06-16T09:29:17.163Z,2.0,The Lodge,2019

585083,Chris Sawin,"_Hotel Transylvania: Transformania_ had a lot of obstacles relating to its release and after viewing the film you can understand why. It’s a lukewarm sendoff that mostly feels like a lethargic attempt to recapture its former glory. It’s built around an entertaining concept that it doesn’t fully capitalize on. It ultimately obliterates character traits for trite gags and cliché punch lines.

585083,r96sk,"I've been expecting a drop-off from this series and it has finally come. Admittedly, it still isn't all that bad.

<em>'Hotel Transylvania: Transformania'</em> is basically what I expected its past entries to be like, at least the most recent two. I mentioned in my <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/hotel-transylvania-3-summer-vacation/"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation</a>'</em> review that the watchable plots were the only thing I was enjoying about these flicks (cast/characters being extremely meh, same again here) so one was bound to slip up eventually.

This one I found to be quite boring, if not terrible. Focusing heavily on just Dracula and Johnny was a bad call, especially given Adam Sandler's absence as the former. I actually wouldn't have predicted that the film would've missed Sandler (given my aforementioned thoughts), but it's a case of you don't know what you've got until you lose it because Brian Hull is a lame replacement; nothing against him personally, of course!

The setting of South America just takes out any <em>'Hotel Transylvania'</em>-y vibes too, so another wrong decision in my opinion. Here, the story isn't interesting enough to, like across 1 to 3, cover for the gaps in location, cast, characters etc. - at least in my eyes.

2662,Wuchak,"Rob Zombie’s comic book non-horror take on “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” 

RELEASED IN 2003 (but shot in 2000) and written/directed by Rob Zombie, ""House of 1000 Corpses” is a horror/black comedy about two young couples who inadvertently visit a house of demented serial killers in backwoods Texas.

A critic summed the movie up as “a ridiculous horror comedy, but with extremely annoying villains.” It was inspired by (or rips off) “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” (1974) and combines it with the cartoonish horror comedy of “Evil Dead II” (1987) while throwing in a little “The Funhouse” (1981).

The entire first act, including the amusing prologue that introduces Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), is very entertaining, but the over-the-top approach starts to get dull by the middle of the picture with the overdone events at the demented Firefly abode. The last act gets so cartoonish that I thought maybe the main protagonist (Erin Daniels) was experiencing a nightmare. The fantastical elements strip away any vestige of horror that was hardly there in the first two acts, which were too zany to take as serious horror. As such, I can’t see anyone older than 7 finding this movie “disturbing.” Still, the film pulsates with colorful pizazz and characters, not to mention a quality score/soundtrack.

Sheri Moon Zombie is effective in her role as Baby Firefly. I liked her voice and didn’t mind her laugh (which many criticize), but she’s a little too thin for my tastes. Daniels works pretty well as the main protagonist. But, considering Zombie’s resources (e.g. the five captive cheerleaders), the flick sorta drops the ball in the female department.

The film sat on the shelf so long because Universal feared a NC-17 rating. Lions Gate eventually picked it up, but it was cut & edited in an attempt to achieve an R-rating. The original version was 16 minutes longer.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 29 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Chicken Ranch Backlot, Universal Studios; Palmdale; Santa Clarita; and Saugus).

2662,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**Style, blood, guts and hard rock, without any decent script to back it up.**

Rob Zombie has devoted his life to music and horror movies, but so far I haven't seen a single movie of his that's really worthwhile. The director's style is that very low-budget and low-quality horror that made school in the 70s and 80s. In truth, I must say that there is some coherence here, if we consider the musical style of Zombie's projects. However, it is a film that disgusts us, and that causes more strangeness and repudiation than fear.

In this film, we follow four teenagers who accidentally stumble into a village of abnormal people and end up intrigued by a local legend about a mad doctor who cut people up, was executed and disappeared, leaving in doubt whether he had really died. Of course, they end up in an even crazier, morbid and dysfunctional house of people, who are behind an endless series of crimes.

By my standards, this movie is so bad that it doesn't even work as a comedy. There is not a scary moment, based on a strangely bizarre script, without content. The film shows the influences of slash horror, with lots of gore, blood running everywhere and bodies torn to pieces. Cannibalism, necrophilia, sadism, if we think of depravity this film will probably have some scene associated with what we think. That, on the one hand, has a vantage point: the film is gritty enough to pull it off, in an era when horror movies are so bland that even underage kids can see them.

The cast brings together a series of actors who have become famous precisely in slash cinema: Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, Karen Black, Tom Towles, Dennis Fimple. Each one of them did their job well, they are the right actors for this type of material, they are perfectly comfortable doing this. However, Haig and Moseley are particularly effective and work very well, stealing the audience's attention whenever they appear. Sheri Moon, an actress who has a certain relevance in the film, is however an amateur, Rob Zombie's girlfriend, who entered the film at his request. Love has these things, it makes us do crazy things. Unfortunately, and as it is routine in these films, the teenage victims of the carnage are simply talking meat that we can't care less about for a minute.

The film does some pretty competent visual effects work, with gallons of fake blood and other effects designed to make the killing realistic and ""fun"" enough. The sets and costumes were also very well thought out and create a decadent environment, in which rurality is distorted and transformed into the perfect environment for a Halloween massacre. That is, the film has style, it has an extremely worked and complex look, but that's about it. It does not present us with content, substance that makes the film worthwhile.",2023-03-14T21:04:35.384Z,2.0,House of 1000 Corpses,2003
2082,tmdb17996075,"I don't have a problem with remakes per se. Even though I am not a big fan of the original ""Halloween"" film directed by John Carpenter, I do acknowledge it as a film that started a horror slasher trend and served as an inspiration for many of the films that came after it. Since I am not crazy about the 1978 film, I thought I would be able to enjoy this remake without being too influenced by my love for the original film. After seeing this remake, I started to appreciate the original version a little bit more, since Rob Zombie turned the story and its characters into a vulgar mess.

The original film mostly focuses on the life of Laurie Strode going on about her business and interacting with her friends for the most part, while we see the mysterious Michael Myers stalking her, appearing from out of nowhere, and we never really get to know why (without taking the sequels into account). In this remake, Rob Zombie attempts to explore little Michael Myers' psychology, giving our villain a soul and establishing the roots of his evilness, taking away all the mystery and darkness surrounding the character. The results are not good by any means and the only thing it proves, is that sometimes, mystery is scarier and more disturbing than having everything explained, especially if the explanation is as predictable as ""he was raised in a bad environment"". The audience doesn't want to be spoon fed and I think it's clear that one of the main reasons why the original villain was scary, it's because Michael Myers remained as an enigmatic character from the beginning until the end. In the original film, Myers appears to come from a seemingly normal family, but for some reason, he turns out a merciless killer anyway. While the original ""Halloween"" film is not my favorite, as I established before, I do give the film credit for giving us a villain that no one could ever sympathize with. This film basically tries to portrait Michael as a poor little thing who was poorly raised and eliminates any possibility of seeing him as a genuinely dark and fear-provoking character. This overexposure of Michael's early years lasts about 40 minutes, which gets tedious, it makes the villain more pitiful than frightening and in the end, they don't really manage to establish a point about his insanity all that well either.

Once again, Rob Zombie casts his wife, Sheri Moon Zombie, who was great in 'House of 1000', playing a Insane, trashy girl… but why did she have to play almost the exact same character here? I don't know what's the deal with Rob Zombie having the need to show us his wife stripping and being sexy all the time, maybe it's some kind of fetish they have and it's all good... but 'Halloween' was not the right choice to show Sherri Moon dancing and showing her body again. Another thing that Rob Zombie seems to borrow from his film ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is the fact that the characters are swearing most of the times and while I have nothing against foul language whatsoever, but I think it sounds repetitive and silly when we hear the f-word every 5 seconds. The amount of stupid lines that could be easily compared to some of the crappiest PG-rated films that came out throughout the last years.

I'm really disappointed. I didn't think I was going to hate it so much, but I do and it's a shame because I really wanted to like this film. Better luck next time, I guess. My noble advice for all fans of the original 'Halloween' movie is: Don't watch this remake if you're sensitive, because this hurts a lot. I know I felt cheated, even if I'm not a fan of Carpenter's version either.",2017-02-14T00:24:31.861Z,4.0,Halloween,2007
2082,Gimly,"The film’s first act is simply a huge version of the 1978 classic’s opening scene; following Michael Myers as a child through his first murder(s). Though many people found this tedious and far too drawn-out, personally I relished the opportunity to get more than a half a minute of character-development on the antagonist. In fact, we don’t only get to see Michael growing up and being arrested, the film then goes on to show us his evolution in a mental asylum. Once again, I know that was less than appreciated by quite a number of people who saw the film, but I find the sequence fascinating every time I watch the movie. Things like the relevance of the mask and kitchen knife are explored more deeply than the original, and the brutality of the character of Michael Myers is more striking. Though this is not considered good to hardcore fans of the silent bogeyman-characteristics from the original.

The protagonist of the piece is a character by the name of Laurie Strode, just as she is in the John Carpenter version, and she has two similar off-siders as the original (one of whom is portrayed by Danielle Harris of _Halloween 4_ & _5_ fame). Where the film does not advance in comparison to its predecessor is the dialogue between these three characters. They use virtually identical language to that of the 1978 film, which felt outdated and artificial even then (I can only hope that this was an intentional throwback by Mr. Zombie). 

The Ahab to Laurie Strode is Doctor Loomis, Michael Myers’ psychologist, acted by the consistently fantastic Malcolm McDowell. I believe it is his performance that makes me appreciate Rob Zombie’s remake so much. He steals every scene he is in with his overwhelming presence, particularly in the Zone 2 theatrical version of the film (which to my knowledge is unfortunately not available in Australia).

2082,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"The critics are wrong…again. Well, at least as far as I am concerned. This remake is not bad at all. A lot of people are comparing it with the original which is understandable. A lot of people says that it is crap compared to the original which is not understandable. At least not by me. This is one of the movies where I have seen the original and it was even one of my favorites at the time. I think this remake holds up quite well.

At first I was a bit worried that it was said to be a prequel. At least partly. However it is not really what I would call a prequel. It has a bit of extended background in the first quarter or so but that is not really what I would call a prequel.
I think the movie was pretty much what I expected or perhaps I should say what I hoped for. It is a slasher-movie of course but it resists the temptation to go all overboard. Nowadays you do not really get scared or even shocked by these kinds of movies so I was not really expecting to be. I was just enjoying Michael’s rampage through the town. It is of course a bit scary in itself that you are watching a madman going on a killing spree through a small town and enjoying it but hey, it is all fake!

One problem with the extended background at the beginning of the movie is that now there is kind of a plot-hole that is a bit annoying. When and, more importantly, how did Michael turn from a deranged kid to a supernatural killer with the strength to carry away one ton worth of tombstone and survive being stabbed as well as shot at?

Apart from that I think this movie was not bad at all. Sometimes I actually felt that Michael was behaving a bit too human like when he was stumbling when crashing through walls etc. but on the whole I quite liked this movie. The style is different from the original for sure but I do not feel it is worse or better for that matter.

It is a bit surprising (well maybe not, the French are bizarre when it comes to scheduling movies and TV-shows) that Cine+ did not schedule this movie for actual Halloween instead of the crap they did show. This one would have been perfect then instead of a day after.",2018-03-17T17:58:11.691Z,7.0,Halloween,2007
2082,GenerationofSwine,"Well it has Malcolm McDowell, and he delivers in the master of accents kind of way.

But....1 star for being a reboot, out of principal, especially a reboot of a slasher film that, well, I always thought the deal with those was to keep adding and adding until you have to look up the Roman Numerals in Encyclopedias to make sure you're numbering them right.

""Halloween MCMLXXVIII: This Time it's Easter,""  You know, that sort of thing.

But we will add one for Malcolm McDowell just because, yeah, he delivers.

So two stars: ** And then it seems like Zombies idea was to show a lot of nudity and especially a lot of naked women getting killed by a horrible male monster after committing the sin of fornication.

So three stars: *** And that is because he MIGHT--with a really big stretch on that--have been trying to do a satire thing of the slasher genre with all the naked murdered women.

But...he could have also been going for mainstream snuff porn.

I'm honestly not sure which way to go on this one...so We are back to two stars: ** Just because it really might not have been an attempt at satire and I sort of want to be sure.

And we can't add any more because well...

It was already made and when it came around in 1978 it was moody and atmospheric and, well, it really looked a lot like Halloween, only a nightmare version of it.

Zombie's remake feels more like a cheap version of Halloween and really, the outdoor shots that are supposed to give you the seasonal feel remind me more of Thanksgiving pick-up football games. They look and feel less like a nightmare version of Halloween than Season of the Witch's small Southern Town atmosphere.

And the horror parts, really, ANY slasher movie and, by the way, since when was Halloween about T&A? I thought Friday the 13th owned that stereotype and we went to Halloween for, you know, atmosphere and scares...at least in the first 2 films.

So really, I guess my point is that it has Malcolm McDowell and that is slightly redeeming. He's always fun to watch...even in his bad movies...like this one.",2023-01-14T03:07:00.724Z,1.0,Halloween,2007
2082,r96sk,"I'm unmoved by this <em>'Halloween'</em> remake.

I guess that is of little surprise as I'm not someone who overly enjoys the 1978 original, I do like it but it is nought special to me personally. All in all, based on reading back my review of that aforementioned flick and based on my thoughts whilst watching, this is a weaker film in every way.

The only true positive I have is the Michael Myers theme, which is just a carry-over from the 1970s release - as ace as it is to hear it again, I would've preferred if they went without it... it kinda feels like they forced themselves to find spots to use it for the sake of using it. This production missed a Jamie Lee Curtis-esque performance, no-one stands out in that regard - Scout Taylor-Compton tries, but to no avail.

I never found Michael Myers himself all that scary or uncomforting in the original and that is again the case here, even to a further degree in all honesty. Myers just feels so brute-force all the time that there is no intrigue or creepiness about him here in my opinion. Malcolm McDowell didn't do anything for me as Loomis either, though it's cool to see Brad Dourif appear.

The opening 50 minutes and the closing 50 minutes felt like a bit of an abrupt switch too, admittedly I might have noticed something that doesn't exist but that's how it felt. It seemed early on like a noticeably different portrayal of <em>'Halloween'</em>, then the latter part felt more like a more standard, by the numbers remake.

I am sure those who watch films rarely might have more fun with it. I mean edgy moments with all the scares. From a new director with a decent cast.

321258,Frank Ochieng,"Let’s face facts…it is inevitable that bad horror films and the new beginning of a movie season go together as systematically as skeleton bones to an unmarked grave. In either case, both scenarios are routinely realized and does not look to change at any time in the immediate future. Director William Brent Bell’s (‘The Devil Inside’) latest banal boofest **‘The Boy’** is basically business as usual in terms of registering as a flaccid fright fable pitted in the dumping ground of released duds in the relatively new year. In essence, ‘The Boy’ is one stillborn terrorizing tyke born out of artificial and tired creepy conventions.

Sure, **The Boy** has its share of atmospheric chills and, as a production, it exudes a tension-filled anxiousness courtesy of the polished Gothic-induced vibes in gives off in its sinister-looking set designs. Nevertheless, **The Boy** fails to hold our attention where it truly counts in structured, solid storytelling and viable psychological thrills. Instead, Bell’s pat knee-shaking narrative spends its time focusing on the familiar and flawed cliches involving meager melodramatic plot developments, recycled unnatural occurrences, the movie’s harried heroine and her beleaguered backstory and annoying jolts and tiresome false jump starts in manufactured suspense. Of course, ‘The Boy’s panic playground for its horrific happenings takes place in a spacious and darkened manor populated by eccentric occupants and their devoted, demonic doll (hence, ‘the boy’ in question).

American Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan, ‘The Walking Dead’) travels across the pond to start over in the quaint English countryside as she leaves behind the fragments of a bad relationship back the States. Greta looks to pursue a job opportunity as a nanny for the Heelshire couple (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle) at their expansive estate. The Heelshires need Greta for tending to their son Brahms’s personal affairs. The unusual discovery from the newly hired nanny, however, is that Greta’s task is to watch Brahms, a porcelain doll and NOT a human little boy. The Heelshires, out of touch with reality, treats the inanimate tot as a real son. Nevertheless, a job is a job so Greta minds the toy tyke when his ‘parents’ decide to go away for the holiday.

Thankfully, Greta learns about the histrionics pertaining to the Heelshires and Brahms through their deliveryman Malcolm (Rupert Evans). The Heelshires’ disillusionment originated nearly two decades ago when the original and real-life Brahms died in a tragic fire. This, of course, reveals the questionable quirks about the boy’s maturing parents’ behavior and denial mode in substituting the doll conveniently for their belated and beloved son Brahms. Greta is determined to do right by the Heelshires and treat Brahms with the compassion they imaged her duties would entail. Importantly, Greta must make a good impression on the unassuming boy doll as the Heelshires warned that Brahms has had his troubles with past nannies.

At first Greta is pensive to react to Brahms and leaves him sitting idle in the corner. The Heelshires had given specific instructions on how to handle their precious “boy” as they have naturally spoiled him with amounts of attention.  Greta eventually finds the nerve to cater to Brahms’s every caretaking whims and soon expresses a fondness for him in the process. So far, so good, right?

**The Boy** certainly has its moments of shock value but the sluggish story feels lukewarm for the most part. Bell and screenwriter Stacey Manear cobble together a mysterious and moody horror thriller that is somewhat old-fashioned as it relies on tension-building tactics involving shadowy hallways, dim-light rooms and innuendo scares that suggest more meat to the bone when spotlighting everything from Brahms’s aura of the present to the deceased Brahms’s existence of the past. Both Bell and Manear arm **The Boy’s** leading lady Cohan/Greta with personal issues meant to carry over to the English landscape but the malaise she possesses comes off as matter-of-factly. And who really did not telegraph Greta’s ex-main squeeze Cole showing up in England to claim his woman’s heart only to meet some static concerning the clingy Brahms?

It is such a shame that The Boy could not capitalize any further on its strange and hypnotic inclinations. After all, this off-kilter narrative had the makings for a psychological masking of paranoia and possessiveness but never quite taps into the underscored hedonistic hold that exists between Greta and toyish tot Brahms or Brahms and the salacious spells of the manor where his dubious presence exists. Sadly, the slow burn effectiveness of The Boy stutters especially when revisiting the titillating genre of disturbing dolls and the mayhem they spin towards their hapless human counterparts (yeah, at least **Chucky** and **Magic’s** dummy Fats had some genuine gory gumption to bring to the terrifying table).

What is maddening about **The Boy** is the wasted potential of what perhaps could have been a whacked-out gem that exploited the surreal circumstances of mental and emotional loss and elusive reality. Instead, the intended suspense is as solitary and stiff as the bratty Brahms’s compact body.

321258,Reno,"> When a nanny meets a boy who is a weird toy.

So this is the other 'The Boy'. The last year film was a thriller-drama, but this is a horror-mystery. It feels like watching a classic horror film, especially because of the English atmosphere and the house where it was shot. A young American woman named Greta, takes up a nanny job in England to escape from the troubled relationship with her boyfriend. She discovers the boy she has to look out is a doll and later she observes a series of strange events that leads her to find out the truth. The dark secret comes out and that's the film.

A limited cast film. The suspense was the key to the story narrating successfully. So I expected a big twist at the end, but it was a decent one and the overall film was just above average. The atmosphere was creepy, and then it weakened as the development was decelerated going to the second and the final act. Until the twist, it was good and after that a bit disappointing. Not because of the bad conclusion, but comparing it with the rest, especially after the anticipation it created in us, that end part looked so small and simple. Good film to watch for once, but like the most of the horror films, it's fallen short to get my thumbs up.

321258,skyezero,"I thought to myself, finally someone out there is making a movie on something which is an incredibly common phobia, this is going to be AMAZING! How wrong was I.
After watching this movie I asked my partner what would she do in the females position of having to look after the porcelain Momma’s boy, she replied “shave him and put lipstick on him” - I found this response better than watching the entire movie. I don’t recall one part of this film which I sat an thoroughly enjoyed. So if he had been shaved and made up, maybe then I would have had that slight bit of entertainment.

So we start off and the obviously attractive babysitter girl rocks up at obviously isolated house and an obviously good looking guy is there to greet here, what a fucking groundbreaking start! She walks into the strangers house even though they haven’t even came down to greet her which in my opinion is just damned bad manners so I’m already sat hoping potfingers fucks her up a bit for being so stereotypical. 

The couple she’s working for come downstairs and lo and behold as if the title didn’t give it away, it’s not a child……….it’s a fucking doll. I have to say as well the creepy doll bears resemblance to an 8 year old peadophile. She gets a set of rules which you can see her already disregarding inside her head as she’s taught how to put a doll in PJs and tuck it up for the night, at this point I would have been ordering Dominos and a truck tonne of movies on the sly for the easy time ahead. 
There’s an attic. As if this movie couldn’t be anymore fucking original - we now have a mysterious attic where the audience is supposed to wonder what happens beyond the ladder! I did not, I wondered when is this going to end as I can feel my mind thinking about going back to the Indian takeaway I’ve left downstairs for morning.  I mean she ends up going to explore the attic NAKED, as if I couldn’t be more frustrated at how unoriginal this is, like a lot of other current horrors it has quickly gone down the road to try and make you focus on the potential tits rather than how fucking bored you are by the plot.
I’d wrote a decent amount of things to comment on for after the film but truth be told - all I can say to truly summarise it would be Hollywood horror. The jumps are cheap, the twists are obvious and Brahms (child) just turns into more of a pervert as the movie progresses. If the girl was feeling that fucked up by what was happening surely you’d just get a heavy object and smash his porcelain face in? Well, being quicker about doing this anyways. (OOPS spoiler alert, but if you hadn’t seen that coming then I’m going to guess you’re someone who watched this and thought it was pure golden). 

If you ask me, all Brahms wanted was a bit of action judging by him acting like a randy teenager during the movie, even encased in a pot shell there was no stopping the lad from trying to scope her in the shower. Gotta give it to him for that I guess.

Terrible. Avoid. Stay clear.

The kills and gore quotient are high, bloody and gooey, with the kills not lacking for invention, but plot formula is tired and weary. Crispin Glover makes for something of a curio appearance in the piece, whilst a young Corey Feldman rocks up for a bit of Damien Thorn channelling.

9730,Wuchak,"***Another entertaining sequel, better than Part III***

The first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths at camp, but the franchise introduced a campy element with Part III, which pretty much plagued the rest of the series until the reboot in 2009. 

Released in 1984, ""Part IV: The Final Chapter"" is an exception as it thankfully omits the cartoonish elements of ""Part III"" and serves up another take on the same basic story. This time several youths go out to their parents' vacation home on Crystal Lake to party where they meet the sister & brother from a nearby house, Trish & Tommy Jarvis (Kimberly Beck and Corey Feldman). Then Jason attacks! There’s also someone at the lake hunting Jason for vengeance. 

Like Part III, this film was shot on the West Coast instead of the East Coast, specifically Santa Clarita, CA, and nearby Topanga Canyon, which is 30 minutes south of Santa Clarita, as well as Zaca lake, about 150 miles northwest. The geography is obviously dryer and an all-around contrast to the first two films, but this won’t matter to most viewers.

As usual, the film features a nice assortment of females. This time out, there are no ""minorities"" like the previous movie; the ladies consist of five white girls and a winsome petite mother. Trish is my favorite, the best heroine yet (until the next film that is), followed by Samantha; but they all have their points of interest. 

BOTTOM LINE: Despite its title, Part IV is far from the ""Final Chapter."" There would be four more sequels before the 80s even ran out! In any case, this is another entertaining segment in the series with a fresh assortment of characters and a new female protagonist. This sequel is notable for introducing the character of Tommy Jarvis and hinting at the lingering diabolic Voorhees spirit. 

Like its predecessor, Part IV was shot in dry Southern Cal and Jason, with his iconic mask, is bigger and more imposing than in Part II. While the movie is a step up from Part III it's not as effective as the first two films, largely because of the uneventful mid-section and the rather lame portrayal of Jason in the last act, although his unmasked face is great.

The film runs 9l minutes and the uncut version 97 minutes.

The biggest knock is the bad editing (one scene has Jason killing Crispin Glover in the kitchen and later the girl Glover slept with in the bedroom before a shot back in the kitchen) and poor continuity (the appearance of the family's dog was most noticeable).

316727,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com

Whereas most franchises are characterized by sequels that degrade in quality over time, “The Purge” is one that continues to improve. The first movie was a good premise in search of a story. The second in the series, “The Purge: Anarchy” was a marked improvement, and “The Purge: Election Year” is clearly the best one yet.

In case you’ve been hiding under a rock, the concept behind these movies is simple: the government of America fell after mass unrest and crime eventually led to revolution, and out of the rubble a new party rose. They call themselves “The New Founding Fathers” party and they have discovered a way to dramatically decrease crime and placate the populace: for one 12 hour time span each year, all crime — including murder — is legal. This annual bloodbath is known as (wait for it) “the Purge.”

In this newest installment, the annual Purge has been in place for two decades. When she was younger, Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) was forced to watch as her entire family was murdered in front of her during the Purge. Having survived the horrors of the Purge, the Senator is running for President on an anti-Purge platform that is gaining popularity. Threatened by Senator Mitchell, the New Founding Fathers use the Purge as an opportunity to wipe out their competition by sending a squad of assassins to hunt her down. Protected only by her head of security, Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo, reprising his role from “The Purge: Anarchy”), the Senator must go on the run to survive the night.

In “The Purge: Election Year,” the annual bloodbath is used as a platform to talk about the growing tension between the haves and the have-nots. Because they lack the financial means to protect themselves, the poor are disproportionately victimized during the Purge. In this world, legalized murder is a way for the wealthy and political elite to ensure a placated populace and control the poor. When the victimized start to realize that they are pawns in a game played by the privileged, they start to fight back… by any means necessary.

The elite in this world are typified by ultra-conservative hypocrites who are quick to subvert religion and re-shape their displayed and false piety to advance their own agenda. Murder tourism is encouraged, and the powerful are quick to espouse the wisdom of permissive gun laws. Sound familiar at all?

My chief criticism of the movie is that it got perhaps a little too heavy-handed in its messaging at times, and the horror aspects of the story suffered as a result. At times, the film more closely resembles an action movie than a horror flick, which is a little disappointing for a franchise that excels in displaying inventive — if horrific — kills. Those kills are the moments that stay with you the longest and the ones that keep you up at night. The imagery that we do get is powerful, but it becomes increasingly scarce as the movie progresses.

While it’s not a perfect movie, “The Purge: Election Year” is that rare horror movie that is both entertaining and has something interesting to say. Whether or not you agree with its politics, it’s an interesting vehicle to use for a message that has resonance in our current culture. I just fear that the message will be lost on most.

In ages past, a thing unheard of, but now at least as common as not. Same goes for _Unfriended: Dark Web_. Just about everything is one step up from the first _Unfriended_ movie: Acting, AV, urgency, the shorter wait times, and the new direction _Dark Web_ takes in terms of its antogonists (I won't spoil it for you, but surely you're capable of reading a title and putting it together for yourself) works better in this one too. I feel at least.

Now neither of these films are perfect, but the first _Unfriended_ movie was okaaaaaaaaay, and this one has managed to push it by the skin of it's teeth over in to what I could honestly argue is ""good"".

505058,RalphRahal,"Unfriended: Dark Web takes the unique computer-screen format from the first movie and dials it up with a more grounded and plausible storyline, which makes it far scarier this time around. The technical execution is sharp, seamlessly immersing you in the digital world where every click, message, and video feed ramps up the tension. It’s an unconventional way of storytelling, but the production nails it, making the experience feel eerily real.

What sets this one apart is the shift in tone. Instead of leaning into the supernatural elements of its predecessor, this movie opts for a more realistic and chilling approach. The grounded nature of the story makes the threats feel tangible, and that plausibility is what makes it so unsettling. It’s a change that works in the movie’s favor, as it takes the fear from something fantastical to something that could actually happen, amplifying the intensity and dread.

As a standalone thriller, it excels at creating an atmosphere of paranoia and helplessness, with its focus on the dangers of the digital age. It may not feel like a traditional sequel, given its departure from the themes of the original, but the more realistic approach gives it a unique identity.

Sure, the acting and the dialogue are all pretty routine, but the visual effects have something of ""The Fly"" (1986) to them, as does the story and there is less frenetic panic in this that we see in many other films of this genre. Dare I say, there is even the merest hint of actual science. It is clearly sending us a message that however we may try to plan ahead for any eventuality, when survival of a species is at stake nature finds a way to get round even the most watertight of safety features.

10225,John Chard,"Jason 6: Welcome To Camp Blood!

An absolute hoot of a addition to the Friday 13th franchise. As is often the way with the ""Friday"" sequels, you can talk to one horror fan and this is the worst of the bunch, talk to another and it's the best etc etc. There's a more airy touch here and it serves the formula well, which if the series' fans are honest, is a formula that was getting stale quite early in the chain, so any sort of new ideas or direction is most welcome. 

After a glorious James Bond parody opens the credits sequence, accompanied by Harry Manfredini's superbly thunderous musical score, we get long running tormented character Tommy, here played by Thom Matthews, digging up Jason Voorhees' corpse so as to make sure the evil one is dead - oh and to kill him again. Enter a glorious Frankenstein homage (cheeky steal if you like) that sets us up for another round of stalk and dismember as Jason heads back to Camp Crystal Lake, which is now called Camp Forest Green!

The kills are not particularly inventive, but there's a real thud of humour about much of them. From an American Express Card to a bloody smiley face imprint, it's clear the makers have a glint in their eyes. We even get an early appearance from Tony Goldwyn, some four years before Ghost would make him a known name. Adding to the quality score, which BTW rattles around home cinema speakers lie a supernatural entity, is Jon Kranhouse's cinematography, which is gorgeous in colour lens selections. All that and you get an Alice Cooper soundtrack as well.

10225,Wuchak,"***Jason lives again as a horrific zombie, plus Megan (Jennifer Cooke)***

Released in 1986, ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"" is notable for being the premiere of the zombie Jason as his rotting corpse is resurrected in the prologue indirectly through the actions of Tommy Jarvis and a friend who recently got out of a mental institution. This prologue also shows that Tommy didn't murder Pam at the end of Part V and that he was simply experiencing hallucinations from his trauma with the diabolic Voorhees spirit. Another difference with Part VI is that we finally get to see a busload of kids, children, at Crystal Lake, although they changed the name to Forest Green. Tommy runs to the local police to inform them that Jason has been resurrected but the sheriff, of course, doesn't believe him (would you?). His hot daughter, Megan, is attracted to Tommy and, when the bloody body count rises, the sheriff realizes that Jason is indeed alive.

Tommy Jarvis is played by Thom Mathews rather than John Shepherd, who was excellent in Part V. Thom is a worthy replacement, but I prefer Shepherd's brooding charisma.

The film features one of the best Friday girls in Megan, played by Jennifer Cooke, although Pam from the previous film is my favorite. Other than that, though, the females in Part VI are rather weak, although the redhead in the Volkswagen is notable (Nancy McLoughlin). 

The campiness of Part III and Part V returns for this installment, particularly with the goofy paintball warriors and the graveyard caretaker. But “Jason Lives” is noticeably superior to Part III and shares the kinetic vibe of Part V.

As far as locations go, Part VI returns to the East for filming, being shot roughly 40 miles East of Atlanta in Covington & Rutledge .

BOTTOM LINE: You either like the Friday the 13th series or you don't. Part VI is another retread of the same Friday formula with the entertaining spirit of Part V and the distinction of Jason now being totally inhuman, a horrific zombie; not to mention the addition of children at the camp. It also has a better story than parts III and IV with the sheriff and his daughter & Tommy going after Jason, plus Megan is one of the top Friday girls in the series. 

The film runs 91 minutes and the cut version 86 minutes.

429471,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

As a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, especially when it involves alien invasions of some kind, movies like this always leave me excited. It doesn’t matter what the audience or critics have been saying (in fact, it never does) because it won’t affect my enthusiasm (in fact, nothing does). By knowing who the cast, director, writers, and producers are, I instantly know how high or low I need to set my expectations. Having this in mind, I was hoping that Captive State could be one of 2019’s surprises. It has an unusual concept that can provide a very unique story if it’s well-told, so the big question is: did they execute all of their ideas successfully?

Unfortunately, no. Not even close. Honestly, the screenplay is so convoluted and messy that I felt “lost” several times. I admire the amount of work that they put into this because they actually did and it shows. The overall concept and its ramifications are all there, the story is indeed interesting. It’s just the way that it’s told that ruins the entire thing. However, the first sentence I heard after the film’s conclusion, came from someone who said: “here I was expecting massive action and …” If you go into your movie theater expecting a straightforward, action-heavy, alien-invasion-type flick and you leave disappointed, that’s on you! From the trailers to its marketing, there was never a message of “hey, this is pure action, humans vs. aliens!” 

It tried its best to give the world a different take on this “sub-genre”, let’s call it that. I mean, they had it all: a good cast with the always astonishing John Goodman (William Mulligan) as one of the protagonists, beautiful visual effects that elevated the set design, and the aliens actually have an intriguing physical shape. Sadly, there’s barely any aliens throughout the runtime. There’s hardly … anything. I don’t know what happened post-production, but it feels like they were pushed to deliver something different, so they cut all of the other scenes with extra-terrestrial stuff (I’m certain that they had more to show).

The main issue here is that you can never have a 100% ambiguous story. Arrival is probably the best non-typical alien-invasion movie ever, not because it scarcely shows any aliens or action, but due to its twistful and thought-provoking script. Nevertheless, it still shows a lot! You don’t leave that film disappointed because you didn’t see the inside of a spaceship or an actual alien. You leave perplexed and with your mind blown. Captive State just leaves you confused and wishing for more. A lot more. There’s really not that much more to say on this review without getting into spoiler territory.

Sadly, this is one of those movies that come out every year showing tremendous potential, an innovative and intriguing premise, but that in the end, it just isn’t able to succeed. It doesn’t structure its story and ideas in the most efficient way possible. Its execution is sloppy, filled with hollow characters, no real flow (it feels like it’s just a scene after another scene), too vague, and it profoundly hopes that you didn’t figure out a pretty obvious twist so they can shock you seconds away from the end. It’s not horrible, but it’s definitely frustrating and disappointing.

John Goodman delivers a great performance as always, and the visual effects are striking, to say the least. The production quality is undeniable, they really worked hard to provide the audience with an environment that actually feels real. The first act is pretty good, but it’s downhill from there. Ashton Sanders shares the lead with Goodman, and he’s also pretty good, no doubt about it. However, and this sums up the film pretty well: if I have to check online what the name of the main character was (Gabriel Drummond), then something went terribly wrong. It’s not going to end up being one of the worst movies of the year, but so far, it’s the biggest letdown.

So where were we at now then? Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is still continuing to do the bloody work of the dead John Kramer/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). In his sights is William Easton (Peter Outerbridge), an unfeeling insurance head who turned down claims by Kramer and a myriad of others on pathetic technicalities. Cue more elaborate traps, painful decisions and some twisty devilment. Yep! It's another Saw movie.

Somewhat surprisingly, part 6 is a step up in quality of writing and ingenuity of gore/trap factors from the previous two installments. It's still very much old hat as a formula, and once again the sequences of Bell used in flashback show him to be the franchise's strength. However, the makers put at the core an insurance issue that everyone can identify with, whilst piling on mystery and suspense by way of Jigsaw's left envelopes and the FBI closing in on an increasingly overt confident Hoffman. 7/10",2015-10-11T03:00:21.071Z,7.0,Saw VI,2009

Scary fun when you are a little kid. Not so scary fun when you are an adult, but... fun. I grew up in rural America in the 80s, parents really didn't censor, they would take you to see Robocop and Nightmare on Elm Street, because there was more faith in children then.

Somehow that became wrong.

I don't really remember going to see this in the theater. I do remember seeing a cartoon of the lake segment. I do remember catching this on HBO one weekend, and I totally remember renting it for sleep overs.

And it ALWAYS was a win, especially when you know the other kid hadn't seen it yet. It was like Evil Dead II in my high school years. They haven't seen it yet? Yeah, we are renting that, you are going to love it.

159117,LastCaress1972,"Are you just about done with the anthology horror mini-revival? Sick to death of cinéma vérité? Well... I was about to say, ""Move along, then; there's nothing for you here,"" but that wouldn't be fair on this movie OR you. If you're through with first-person perspective found-footage portmanteau horrors then fine, but just stay for one more. Please? Because it's a belter, this one.

Last year's V/H/S was IMO terrific, but it had its flaws. The wraparound story and the first story proper gave the movie a disturbing early feeling of misogyny thanks to both stories' protagonists having sexual gratification of one manner or another as their principal reason for filming their actions, the film's running time struggled to cope with six tales being told, and the shaky first-person cameras were the shakiest of shaky, nausea-inducing cameras in the history of the first-person perspective. Thankfully for the sequel, nobody's shooting footage for the sake of amateur pornography (an early tit-shot establishes our wraparound-segment protagonist as a private investigator, but that's it until some much lighter, more jocular sex-filming exchanges in the last segment, of which more later), V/H/S/2 is telling five stories in all rather than six (hopefully by V/H/S/3 they'll have learned a further lesson: The wraparound stories are completely redundant, so let's ditch 'em), and that extra time is put to good use, and the shaky-cam... it's still there of course - goes hand-in-hand with the territory - but it's just nowhere near as bad. For the most part.

So, to the stories themselves:

""Tape 49"" - The wraparound segment, directed by Simon Barrett (who wrote the wraparound segment for V/H/S - ""Tape 56"" - as well as the segment ""The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"" for that earlier movie; he also wrote You're Next and the IMO excellent horror/western Dead Birds). Concerning a private eye and his partner on the trail of a missing student, they come across a house not unlike the one in the first picture, full of not much but stacks of old switched-on CRT televisions and VHS cassette players, and even larger stacks of VHS tapes themselves. They find a laptop with footage of the missing boy, sitting in that very room and explaining about how watching some of these VHS tapes in a certain order will... affect people. Quite how, I'll not say. Suffice to say though that while our private dick searches the house, his partner sits and watches the tapes (these are the four segments making up the main body of V/H/S/2), and trouble abounds. It's a big upgrade on the unlikeable wraparound from the first movie but it's still largely unnecessary and despite some good horror action towards the very end, it made little sense and was subsequently by virtue of its nature the weakest tale of the lot.

Segment 1. ""Phase I Clinical Trials"" - Directed by Adam Wingard (You're Next, V/H/S segment ""Tape 56"", The ABCs of Death segment ""Q is for Quack""), this is a fairly straightforward and derivative piece (The Sixth Sense? The Eye?) about a guy who, following an eye operation to replace his blind right eye with an experimental electronic eye which for the purposes of data collection records everything it ""sees"" (a fairly ingenious if slightly laboured use of the first-person perspective I thought, also neatly sidestepping the thorny ""Why are they still FILMING?!?"" issue that besets all of these sorts of films), starts seeing - you guessed it - dead people. Nothing original to see here in terms of the story, but Wingard's ever-improving directional skills keep the tension levels up and interesting throughout. Not an especially strong start, but a decent start.

Segment 2. ""A Ride in the Park"" - Co-directed by the criminally-underrated Eduardo Sánchez (yes, him. Co-director of found-footage great-grandaddy The Blair Witch Project; also did the absolutely fantastic Altered, plus Seventh Moon and Lovely Molly) and his long-time producer buddy Gregg Hale, and co-written by Sánchez and his long-time writing partner Jamie Nash, this one came with heavy expectations and it didn't disappoint at all. A cracking flat-out zombie fest filmed almost entirely from the perspective of a cyclist's helmet-mounted Go-Pro camera. Our - hero? - Mike takes his bike out for a lovely early-morning spin through the park and is immediately attacked and bitten by a zombie, one of several ambling through these woods. He escapes, runs away, staggers, falters, drops to the floor and dies. Then he gets up. From there on in it's a zombie's-eye view of the carnage and gore, finishing with a flourish on a surprisingly touching note. For zombies, like. Excellent short story. Probably the best segment not only of this movie so far (it's certainly that) but of the V/H/S franchise so far.

Until...

Segment 3. ""Safe Haven"" - Another strong directorial collaboration here, this time between Gareth Huw Evans (The Raid) and Timo Tjahjanto (The ABCs of Death segment ""L is for Libido""). Taking up 30 minutes of V/H/S/2's entire runtime (and worth every second), Safe haven concerns a documentary news crew who - using both conventional professional cameras and mics plus hidden ""button""-cams - go to film the shenanigans at a remote Indonesian compound, in which is housed a ""Heaven's Gate""-style Doomsday cult comprised of their enigmatic leader - The Father - his ""family"" of wives/lovers and (many) children plus other assorted cult members. It is implied that ""The Father"" is promoting and engaging in underage sex with some of the members, and it's this angle the news crew most want to pursue. They end up however with something very different.

Managing to look and feel like an exquisite blend of the co-directors' other works The Raid and ""L is for Libido"" with a good dollop of Doom 3 or some other survival horror game thrown in for good measure, this short represents the best thing that either V/H/S movie has offered us thus far. It's creepy, then it's tense, then it's frantic and as gory as gore gets (all justifiably and within the context of a good tale well told, I might add). If there's a teeny-tiny criticism it could be that a practical visual effect at the very very end of the short (you'll know it when you see it) doesn't quite work and against the otherwise staggering look of all that preceded it, it's quite jarring. However, I'm nitpicking. ""Safe Haven"" is a superior piece and with a few dollars thrown at it could make an excellent and terrifying expanded movie in its own right.

Segment 4. ""Slumber Party Alien Abduction"" - directed by Jason Eisener (Hobo With a Shotgun, The ABCs of Death segment ""Y is for Youngbuck""). Eisener seems to be a bit of a ""love him or loathe him"" director. I WANT to like him but I find his output as frustrating as it is novel, and this is no exception. Essentially, a bunch of kids of varying ages have free reign over their lakeside house, and fill their time with happy, video-based tomfoolery including strapping a camera to their dog to see what he films, blasting one another with urine-filled water guns and busting in on one anothers' ""intimate"" time, be that one of the girls with her boyfriend or one of the doofus young teenagers with his hand, a porno and some time to kill. So far, so goofy. Until a violent attack by a band of hostile classic ""Grey"" aliens kicks off. It's a good idea and the story itself is fine, but this is the one short in the pack that continues to suffer badly from the first movie's shaky-cam syndrome. Once the action starts, you'll struggle to see what's happening. Good stuff, but frustrating. And coming as it does after two truly excellent segments, just a trifle deflating.

So, segments 1 and 4 are of a standard comparable to the first movie, the wraparound piece is an improvement, but the middle two shorts are worth the ticket money on their own and elevate V/H/S/2 above its older sibling and above much of today's horror fare in general. Well recommended.",2013-08-11T15:36:11.384Z,,V/H/S/2,2013
159117,Gimly,"In the past I have only ever reviewed anthology films as a whole, and by-and-large that's probably what I'll go back to doing in the future, but having just watched the last three quarters of the original _V/H/S_, then _V/H/S/2_ and _V/H/S: Viral_ all in one sitting, it all sort of bleeds together and I mostly can't remember which one belongs where, so at least for now, I'm gonna try giving some very, very short reviews for each segment, rather than the overall films.

**Tape 49**: The framing device. These were always the silliest part of the franchise. It doesn't work very well as a jumping off point, and it doesn't work at all as a self-contained narrative.

**Phase I Clinical Trials**: Much better stuff from Adam Wingard, has some of the intensity found in the first _V/H/S_. One of the shorts I think would best translate to a full feature. Could benefit from some better acting though (could be said of all the segments, and isn't a deal breaker for me).

**A Ride in the Park**: Really just one thing going on here, but that's fine for a short film that's just one part of an anthology. A first-person zombie movie shot from the perspective of the zombie is a pretty dope idea. Could have commited to the formula harder, preferably, but the way it is shot I guess makes sense in terms of the larger _V/H/S_ narrative.

**Safe Haven**: The best of what _V/H/S/2_ has on offer. Not perfect, and unexpectedly made me bring out my glasses to read the subtitles, which I guess arguably clashes with not only the other segments but indeed the ""Found Footage"" idea overall. Still, solid entry.

**Slumber Party Alien Abduction**: Probably the weakest. Weird choice to go out on. Tries to have fun but unfortunately just doesn't have the time to carry that idea to fruition before the desperate scramble for the ""horror"" in this found footage horror short.

539181,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

COVID-19 impacted the number of movies released in 2020, but the horror genre didn't seem to really suffer from it. Quality will always be subjective, but in my opinion, this year has examples at every point of the spectrum. I've witnessed some shockingly awful horror flicks (Fantasy Island, The Grudge, The Turning, You Should Have Left), a few ""wasted potential"" examples (Gretel & Hansel, The Rental, The New Mutants), some pretty decent ones (Underwater, Antebellum, Come Play), and more than just a couple of incredible films, some might even end up in my Top10 of the year (The Invisible Man, The Lodge). I didn't know much about Relic, but its premise got me interested.

This is Natalie Erika James' directorial debut, as well as her first feature-length screenplay, co-written with the also first-timer Christian White. Boasting a relatively unknown cast (to me, at least), I can't hide my surprise regarding how much I enjoy this film. Ambiguous horror movies with underlying themes are far from being an audience-favorite subgenre, much on the contrary. Usually, this type of film possesses traits that a regular moviegoer doesn't really look forward to: a slow pace, a series of suspenseful sequences that don't lead to the generic jumpscare, and finally, an ending that apparently might miss some sort of explanation, leaving the audience feeling underwhelmed.

Well, guess what? I love this subgenre, especially when it really hits me in the heart. It has all the ingredients above that I know will make most people think ""this didn't make any sense, it's so boring"". Many viewers will expect just another spooky, supernatural, psychological horror flick, and disappointment will meet them at the end. However, its narrative carries so much more than what's on the surface, and honestly, this is made clear pretty early in the movie. At its core, Relic is quite a realistic depiction of what happens to the older members of some families (unfortunately, more than what it should be), and it approaches extremely sensitive themes such as dementia and the abandonment of old people in nursing homes.

Natalie and Christian's screenplay doesn't hide from delivering a few messages concerning these two topics. Dementia is a terrible disease that, amongst other things, makes people lose what makes them unique, what makes them human, and forget who they truly are. If our parents take care of us throughout our young life, it's only fitting that we take care of them when/if they begin to fail to do so themselves. Not only should we do this because they already did the same for us when we were young, but also due to the possibility that our descendants might have to do the same when we grow old. It's a variation of the known circle of life.

Love should always be present, no matter the circumstances. A little piece of my personal life: my grandfather wasn't quite there at the end. He gradually became unable to drive, walk, and eventually speak. I chose to not see him as much as I did in his last few weeks, simply because I didn't want to remember him as someone he wasn't. My memory of him is intact with the best moments I've spent with him, and not that depressing phase at a nursing home, just laying in bed, waiting for his time to leave our world... It's a small portion of my life that I share with you, so you understand how Relic can impact so many viewers if people give it a legitimate chance with adequate expectations.

The acting is phenomenal across the board. Robyn Nevin can be scary as the grandmother Edna, but in the end, she's the emotional trigger that made me tear up. There are little nuances in her expressions that elevate her overall performance. Emily Mortimer is also outstanding as the mom, Kay, who has to go through all stages in dealing with a parent with dementia. From rejection and separation to acceptance and unconditional love, Kay is the character that gets a more significant focus. Bella Heathcote might have less screentime than the other two, but she's also fantastic as Sam, particularly in the horror sequences. Nevertheless, it's precisely this last point that hurts the film.

The house's atmosphere is incredibly suspenseful, but the third act brings out an unexpected level of horror, which I believe to be exaggerated. The balance between horror and family drama was excellent throughout the first two acts, except for short periods here and there, but the last twenty minutes go through such an over-the-top, eerie, extremely fictional path that ultimately ruins that near-perfect balance. It's almost like the producers came in and said ""we need more horror"", so they filmed a bunch of crazy, mind-bending, physics-defying scenes. This movie didn't need any of that, and it should have stuck with the intriguing drama instead of forcing the disturbing horror.

Technically, Charlie Sarroff's camera work is impeccable. With the help of Denise Haratzi and Sean Lahiff's editing, long takes strongly improve the build-up to the scary sequences, generating exceptional levels of tension and suspense. Brian Reitzell's score is interesting, but there's a point in the film where it gets a bit awkward, having in mind the scene taking place, but it doesn't hurt his overall work. Great pacing control, adequate runtime, and a beautiful, heartfelt, relevant ending that, unfortunately, some viewers won't be able to see past its apparently underwhelming climax.

All in all, Relic is one of those typical horror movies that will divide critics and audiences all around the world. This time, only false expectations can lead to disappointment. Natalie Erika James' directorial debut is far from being a generic horror flick, but a family drama with a very sensitive matter at its core. With the help of the also debutant Christian White, both deliver an exceptionally well-written, genuinely sad yet realistic story about dementia and how old people are treated once they can't live by themselves anymore. A remarkably ambiguous narrative filled with underlying themes leads to an emotionally powerful ending if the viewer is able to understand the implicit messages spread across the runtime. Emily Mortimer, Robyn Nevin, and Bella Heathcote all deliver exceptional performances. Technically, the lingering cinematography plus seamless editing create an extraordinarily suspenseful environment. However, the third act dives into horror way too much, holding unnecessary sequences that only ruin the film's tone, raising questions that don't belong in the movie. Still, I sincerely recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of film, but please manage your expectations as fair as possible.

819876,CinemaSerf,"Whilst certainly nowhere near his best, this is still quite an intriguing drama from David Cronenberg. It all centres around ""Saul Tenser"" (Viggo Mortensen) who uses his own body to grow (or ""cook"") extra organs which he and his assistant ""Caprice"" (Léa Seydoux) extract as part of rather gruesome, but popular, theatrical performances. Meantime, ""Dotrice"" (Scott Speedman) is reeling from the suffocation of his young plastic-eating son (by his own wife) and so convinces the exhibitionists that an autopsy revealing the internal digestive organs of this most unusual of mutations would make for excellent viewing. Don McKellar (""Wippet"") and his colleague ""Timlin"" (Kristen Stewart) run the government department for organ registration and needless to say they take a dim view on the legality of some or all of these activities... or do they? The concept is interesting and ethically highly dubious but sadly the execution is a bit lacklustre and there is way too much dialogue and, oddly enough here, too little use made of the special effects that are at times quite disturbing to watch and are, no pun intended, rather at the heart of the story. Stewart's very presence suggests her character has a more significant part in the proceedings but her appearances themselves are actually quite sparing which is always a bonus for me! It does take a while to get going, and somehow the ending is all rather underwhelming but it still has enough traces of the director's unique style and imagination to make it worth a watch - once",2022-09-19T20:16:24.989Z,6.0,Crimes of the Future,2022

""Personally, I believe that cinematic narratives with multiple plot points and questions related to the world itself are too often confused and envisioned as character studies driven by a single protagonist.

Both Olivia Wilde and David Cronenberg complete their movies when the main character fulfills the minimum requirements of their arc, consequently renouncing all other equally significant issues worthy of in-depth exploration. In the case of Don't Worry Darling, one finishes it with an underwhelming feeling from an unsurprising conclusion, while in Crimes of the Future, viewers are left with several questions and interesting, half-developed paths about such a mesmerizing futuristic world.

We are required to believe that ""Esther"" is this epitome of evil, but the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese so I kept asking myself just how any of this could ever actually happen - even in cinema land. It does have the benefit of being quite short, and to be fair to director William Brent Bell, he doesn't hang around once what passes for the story gets going.

The last film distributed by 20th Century Fox before they were rebranded as 20th Century Studios by Disney, _Underwater_ was shot in early 2017 for $50 million and then sat on a shelf for over two years. Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs – films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is _Blackhat_, Michael Mann's underrated 2015 cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like _Blackhat_, _Underwater_ is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.

At an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors – Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher, Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Fenwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.

Written by Brian Duffield (_The Babysitter_; _Jane Got a Gun_) and Adam Cozad (_Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit;_ _The Legend of Tarzan_), and directed by William Eubank (_Love_; _The Signal_), Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Ridley Scott's _Alien_ (1979) and James Cameron's _The Abyss_ (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as George P. Cosmatos's _Leviathan_ (1989), Paul W.S. Anderson's _Event Horizon_ (1997), Barry Levinson's _Sphere_ (1998), and Danny Boyle's _Sunshine_ (2007). I even detected a slight nod to Neil Marshall's _The Descent_ (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic ""group of isolated people getting picked off one by one"". When someone as talented as Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.

Sure, it isn't really _about_ much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled ""_too deep_"" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And _Underwater_ is both.

Kicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. In _Alien_, Scott takes his time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the _Nostromo_, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, _Underwater_ is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.

Aesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in _Alien_ or _Event Horizon_), and designer Naaman Marshall (_The Visit_; _Don't Breath_; _Stuber_) does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Dorotka Sapinska's costume design, with the bulky pressurised suits looking like astronaut rigs or something out of the _Gears of War_ video games. Also vitally important to the claustrophobic tone is the photography by the great Bojan Bazelli (_Mr. & Mrs. Smith_; _Pete's Dragon_; _A Cure for Wellness_). During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.

Elsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, the creature design by Abner Marín (_The Dark Tower_; _The Predator_) is suitably creepy and grotesque. Even the props are impressive, especially when the crew are forced to arm themselves, à la the Dead Space video games, with non-combat industrial tools such as saws and bolt guns. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was the sound design by Wayne Lemmer (_Kick Ass 2_; _Deadpool_; _Logan_). The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system, particularly at the crossover frequencies.

In terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of _The Outer Limits_. There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, whilst Emily and Liam are dating, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.

Although _Underwater_ never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as _Alien_ and _Sunshine_, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.",2020-02-23T02:19:04.667Z,7.0,Underwater,2020

I was surprisingly interested in and even optimistic about this movie. Why ""surprisingly""? Well, first of all, the cast doesn't really have a big name attached to it even though I actually enjoy some of Kristen Stewart's performances (who, like Robert Pattinson, has a few blind haters that haven't seen anything else other than Twilight), as well as a few other actors (Jessica Henwick, particularly). Then, no director or screenwriter caught my attention. William Eubank hasn't done anything exceptional yet. Brian Duffield co-wrote Insurgent (awful) but delivered a surprisingly fun horror screenplay with The Babysitter. Finally, Adam Cozad helped to create some underwhelming narratives (The Legend of Tarzan, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit).

In addition to this, I'm not in favor of films written by more than two people since these usually disappoint, and... it's a January movie. So, why was I slightly excited to watch Underwater? For the same reason a lot of people probably avoided it: its formulaic horror-thriller story deep at the bottom of the ocean. If a sci-fi film has a premise based on a team that works on a claustrophobic location and some sort of entity ""disrupts"" their job, I'm instantly drawn into these movies. There's something about them that makes me enjoy them more than most people. Usually, this type of film has a low-budget and really requires a talented director who's able to generate genuine tension and suspense.

Underwater is 2020's big surprise. January movies are known to be Hollywood's trash bin, so I'm honestly dumbfounded that this film is far from being bad. It's very, very good! The set and production design are impressive, and they help create that isolated, suspenseful atmosphere. The first few minutes are nail-biting. The next twenty minutes are fantastic. The following twenty minutes continue to be a blast of entertainment. I felt continuously surprised by how good the movie actually is. I still can't believe what I just witnessed!

Don't twist my words, it's not a masterpiece or even a ""great"" film. It still follows a plot-driven narrative that countless other movies did better. It borrows inspiration from Alien, Cloverfield, 20000 Leagues Under the Sea, and every other film involving an alien-like form threatening a crew. Plus, it lacks characterization of pretty much every character. There's no real attempt at deeply developing a single character to make the audience care about it, but this doesn't mean the movie can't succeed. Like I wrote above, there's a whole lot of plot-driven films that went on to be phenomenal.

The difference between those and Underwater is that the latter doesn't truly bring anything new to the genre. It just uses the known cliches and executes them really well, which is itself a massive surprise. I can't deny that I had a lot of fun watching this thriller. I expected messy action with way too dark lighting making it impossible to see anything. I received surprisingly visible, well-filmed sequences, packed with tension, tons of panic, and a palpable sense of urgency. There aren't that many moments to breathe and relax.

The VFX team and Bojan Bazelli (cinematographer) deserve a lot of credit because the ""aliens"" not only are visually captivating, but they are shown just in the right spots for the exact right amount of time. Underwater doesn't possess a huge budget, so the creatures need to be shown ""in the shadows"" to make them look and feel ""realistic"". It might seem like an obvious technical decision to be made, but its execution it's far from being an easy task, so kudos to everyone that participated in making the monsters a genuinely menacing threat.

The cast is excellent. Kristen Stewart continues to break out of the Twilight shell, proving again and again that she's a wonderful actress. Jessica Henwick is pretty great, as well as Vincent Cassel. Everyone delivers fairly decent performances, even T.J. Miller, who portrays the always divisive comic-relief character that will surely be extremely annoying to some, and quite funny to others (I stand in the middle, I think his character is fine).

It's definitely a good sci-fi horror-thriller, way better than most January flicks (Underwater is one of the last 20th Century Fox's movies, which probably means that Disney had no clue what to do with it, hence dumping it in the worst month of the year). I just added William Eubank to my list of directors to follow. His commitment to actually make a good film is demonstrated on screen, so I really hope that his movie gains some sort of following when it reaches people's homes.

Underwater is 2020's (first) massively positive surprise. A January film far better than most of the month's competition. William Eubank delivers a remarkably well-filmed sci-fi horror-thriller filled with great tension, surprisingly visible (!) action, fantastic production design, and some really captivating VFX work. It's by no means a brilliant movie! It takes inspiration from better films of the same genre, and it follows a straightforward, plot-driven narrative with close to zero character development. It simply uses the known cliches but executes them really well. An underrated cast led by Kristen Stewart offers some notable performances, but it's the claustrophobic atmosphere surrounded by incredibly well-generated suspense that turns this movie into a success. Technically, I still can't believe how surprised I am. I just wish that it had a little bit of more characterization, so I could recommend it even more. As it stands, do watch it at the highest quality when you get the chance.

443791,Gimly,"Kristen Stewart actually kind of pulls off carrying this thing, which was a surprise to me. I know a lot of people have really enjoyed her post-_Twilight_ career, but I haven't really latched on to anything she's done. It feels pretty short, but not as short as it actually is at 95 minutes. The creatures were cool, I'm pretty sure. It was kind of hard to see. But for all its ups and downs I did basically enjoy _Underwater_, a solid mix of creepy monster, creepy environment, interspersed with tension-relieving dialogue. The only real problem is that it's **very** derivative. Not a massive issue in and of itself, the trouble is that it means every five minutes you think to yourself ""Oh! This is just like X Movie (usually _Alien_)... I kinda wish I was watching that instead"".

To be fair, I was sick when I saw this was available and couldn't resist watching it.

I'm a fan of Kristen Stewart (most of the time), and sure, she runs around in her underwear for a lot of the movie, but that's not a reason to watch the movie, it's a horrible reason for a web search.

A great reason to watch this is that it is a underwater survival story.  The isolation and technical strategy involved in dealing with this situation makes it gravely atmospheric, without the threat of ""monsters"".  Honestly, that version would have also made a great movie.

The movie clearly takes queues from several other great movies, and while it does it very well, the problem there is ""several"".  Had the movie mirrored only ""Alien"", it probably would had been a stronger story.  Clearly the writers wanted the threat to build, similar to video games, or possibly more similar to an alien invasion movie.

The cross between a survival / slasher movie and an invasion movie muddles the feel of the movie somewhat.  It downgrades the movie from truly excellent to great, and I don't feel that everyone is going to get the proper experience to recognize all of the great individual parts because the overall pie tastes a little funny.",2021-01-01T15:24:06.175Z,8.0,Underwater,2020

This indie sci-fi thriller Vivarium from Irish filmmaker Lorcan Finnegan is many things, one definitely being quite the head-scratcher. Not because of it being an intellectually challenging story, or one that is laced with twists and turns to create an unpredictable viewing, but a film that delivers a narratives so peculiar that it is like something you've never seen before. Take this with a pinch of salt, as there's certainly aspects which don't make the landing of such an ambitious plot, but let it also be known that Vivarium contains some impressions visual and narrative storytelling, enough to forgive some of the mid-act waffle that cripples the films momentum.

Finnegan gets the ball rolling with power, keeping the story taught enough that we are thrown straight into the mystery early doors. This works extremely well as the tension begins to bubble within the first ten minute mark. The performances here from our main cast member already begin to show their brilliance, especially Jonathon Aris who sets a chilling foreshadowing tone with his appropriately eerie character Martin. The small (yet effective) amount of screen time we have with Martin is enough to set the tone, and we, like Tom and Gemma are forced to endure something that is so ominously intense that it leaves a lingering sense of dread.

Unfortunately, this soon begins to simmer once Finnegan establishes the plot in its whole, and realisation settles on the simple fact that, after the 30 minute mark, there really isn't much else for the story to go. Yes the labyrinth maze of suburbia is strangely terrifying, and the strenuous repetition is effective, but after 15 minutes of having the child introduced, Vivarium begins to fall flat, and grow increasingly more stale up until after the sixty minutes in. The fantastic Poots and Eisenberg, and the deadpan humour do prevent this film from becoming a little too one-note, but this doesn't exuse more than a few scenes that will be a task to sit through, even in these current homebound world we are living in.



There is a glimmer of brilliance in Finnegan's choice of release here, as what our main couple are enduring is poetically reflective of the life we are living in this mad pandemic virus. I found myself identifying with the irritated attitude our characters develop, and sympathised with them when their child (the boy) was well deserving of a slap. Vivarium is intelligently relative right now, and can definitely be perceived as as Finnegan holding a mirror up to the idealistic yet treacherous concept of what makes the perfect home, and the urge to be the perfect family.

In fact, there's so much underlying aspects of Vivarium that are so incredibly reflective of the inevitable repetition that comes once a spunky couple are weighed down by family life, securing their ""ideal"" home and tolerating each others impurities under the same roof constantly. Finnegan exposes the dangers of the nuclear family here, and forces us to endure it too, warts and all. We even get those little moments in which Tom consistently chips away, digging a whole, not to be talked to, helped or interrupted by Gemma, who becomes a slave to ensuring nothing but contentment for their boy. This moment is humourous with a dark sting, and will be reflective of reality to many, but to those inside Vivarium is nothing but a nightmarish loop.

This distorted utopia Finnegan creates is what's most effective, orchestrated by a Burton-esque palette that is as gorgeous as it is hauntingly off-kilter. The early 80's, Romero's Day of the 

Dead-like synth is undeniably effective, and carries the tension through to the final act, which although doesn't hit a payoff point that excuses the slow middle act, does add to the bankers reality Finnegan has crafted, and highlights the eeriness established from the beginning. While Vivarium does lose a tone of momentum when it hits the mid-way point, by the time it reaches its end, I can't shake the distinct feeling of unease I had to endure for over eighty minutes, and I can't deny that a film like this was an experience I have quite been exposed to before. I have been feeling really under the weather these past few days, and let's just say this only made me feel worse. Great job, I guess?


VERDICT 
Vivarium is a simplistically disturbing suburban nightmare with a captivating story and little room for growth. Enduring its drab middle act may prove tricky, but once Finnegan blows the dust of the eerie intensity established from the beginning, you'll find there is much to be desired with this unsettling little indie-sci-fi thriller.",2020-04-13T16:30:06.521Z,6.0,Vivarium,2019
458305,Kamurai,"Amazing watch, will watch again, and can recommend.

Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg (both from ""The Art of Self Defense"") are amazing in their roles as an abducted couple force to raise a child.

This is an amazing premise (see ""Solar Opposites"" for something similar), and one that is extremely hard to discuss without spoilers. This is a wonderful mix of tropes. There is a prisoner / abductee trope, there is ""adoption of a strange child"" trope, there is a ""troubled couple"" trope, there is even a mystery trope.

I'm fully of the opinion that the right thing to do in any abduction situation is to not reward the criminals with what they want because there is no reason that while they have all the power that they're going to do anything to benefit the victims. We get see an exploration of what people do in a dire situation and given a task, similar to a couple different ""Twilight Zone"" episodes.

The production value is clearly here, and while they appear to have saved some money on limited locations, it clearly put to good use as the movie delves deeper into its story.

I read the generally high praise in the reviews for this movie and admittedly, I was fooled. I'm convinced that at least the individual here who likened part of its premise to the animated series, ""Solar Opposites,"" while not being entirely off the mark, neglected to mention that unlike Solar Opposites, there is no payoff with Vivarium. Unlike Solar Opposites, we don't know why Vivarium exists. We don't know why people are expected to raise these mysterious hominids. We don't know what their purpose is, other than to entrap first home buyers, like some kind of otherworldly predatory lender. Is it a euphemism for unscrupulous property developers? Who knows?

Only thing I know is that by the end of it all, I felt totally ripped off. At around 90 minutes, it was 60 minutes too long. It's not even something that I can suggest is open to much interpretation.

458305,disasteroidd420,"Vivarium was eerie and creepy, and definitely a movie that will mess with your head, albeit probably in ways other than you anticipated. You'll be tricked in the beginning into believing this movie is actually a sociological observation of the slow and robotic death of suburban life: you and your nuclear family settle into middle class conformity in a large, seemingly endless design of mazes and hedges, condemned to repeat the endless cycle of home, school (or work), home, sleep, rinse and repeat. And it certainly gives one those unsettling vibes, especially when the creepy box with the build-a-baby arrives at their prison doorsteps.

Rather, this is something else entirely. While it does well maintaining that nearly subtle sense of wrongness, of something being terribly just _off_, in the end, you may find yourself somewhat disappointed, as it is at this precise moment the film becomes like every other movie of its kind out there.

458305,RalphRahal,"""Vivarium"" is one of those movies that pulls you in with an interesting concept but leaves you questioning everything, especially the choices the characters make. The story follows a couple who find themselves trapped in a seemingly endless suburban neighborhood, forced into a bizarre and unsettling routine. The mystery keeps you engaged, but the characters’ decisions often feel frustrating. Not in a ""bad script"" way, but in a way that makes you wonder if they were written to be this passive on purpose. The pacing leans toward slow-burn horror, relying more on psychological unease than traditional scares.

The directing does a solid job of maintaining tension, making the whole thing feel claustrophobic and surreal. The cinematography enhances this with sterile, repetitive visuals that emphasize the artificiality of their world. Acting-wise, Imogen Poots delivers a strong performance, while Jesse Eisenberg brings his usual style, which sometimes works but occasionally feels forced. The real standout is the child actor, his unsettling presence adds a lot to the film’s eerie atmosphere. There’s a lot of subtlety in how he moves and reacts, making you wonder whether his voice was altered or dubbed over in post.

The script keeps things cryptic, and while that works for the tone, it also leaves some moments feeling underdeveloped. The lack of clear explanations may frustrate some viewers, but it’s clear that the movie is more about the experience than the answers. The sound design plays a big role in the tension, using unsettling audio cues to make certain scenes even more uncomfortable. Overall, Vivarium is a strange, thought-provoking film that raises more questions than it answers. If you like psychological horror with a heavy dose of surrealism, it’s worth a watch.

72331,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I was somewhat prepared to be disappointed by this movie due to its rather bizarre title and story but to my enjoyment I wasn’t. I found it to be a quite enjoyable movie. 

The story is somewhat bizarre indeed, but then what would you expect when Tim Burton has stuck his fingers into the production? The blurb about the film is also not exactly correct. The 16th president doesn’t discover that vampires are planning to take over the United States. It’s more on the line that he enters politics and actually becomes the 16th President because of the vampires. The story also manages to, more or less, blame the slave trade on the vampires. After all, slaves would make a nice food source for plantation-owning vampires wouldn’t it? As I said, the story is indeed somewhat bizarre. 

The film as a whole is quite enjoyable though. Well, I guess you have to like vampire/action movies in order to find it enjoyable but then, why else would you want to see this movie in the first place? There’s enough action to keep the film going most of the time. If anything, maybe the training parts were a bit rushed and too short. The action is quite well done, reasonably blood-splattering, and fun to watch. 

The axe-swinging Abraham Lincoln is a cool twist instead of the usual wooden stake, cross swinging or dart throwing vampire hunters that we’re used to see. He must be bloody, as in unnaturally, strong to be able swing around that axe the way he does but what the heck, it’s a vampire movie after all, so one should perhaps not nit-pick on such things. 

There’s a scene near the end of the film where a train is about to crash down into a ravine since the bridge, that the vampires have set on fire, is about to collapse. That’s scene was a bit silly and overly unrealistic. There’s also a fairly big whoops in the make-up department where Abraham and his friend Joshua clearly has aged a lot towards the end of the movie, which you would expect, but his wife and his friend Will seems not to have aged at all.

565028,Manuel São Bento,"I rewatched the 1992's Candyman in preparation for Nia DaCosta's (Little Woods) direct sequel, so I could get the most out of it without having to force my memory to kick in. Despite being addicted to Philip Glass' score of the original film, Bernard Rose's take on Clive Barker's short story isn't exactly one of my favorite classics, even though I appreciate it quite a bit. Expectations-wise, I didn't know the director beforehand, but I was curious to see what DaCosta could bring to the famous tale.

Unfortunately, I'm not the right person to tackle the heavy themes depicted in the filmmaker's sophomore flick. From an evident, strong opinion about gentrification to the biased white critical lenses, the director has a clear vision and firm messages concerning cultural injustice. As a white European young man, I'm not going to pretend to have experience or even enough knowledge to approach these necessary, sensitive debates, so I'll let other critics, namely Black authors, spread their voices.

Nevertheless, I have mixed feelings about this sequel. Despite being beautifully shot (John Guleserian), edited (Catrin Hedström), and scored (Robert A. A. Lowe), the thematically driven screenplay often feels forced and occasionally preachy. Characters are thinly developed through an uncommonly too short runtime. The never-ending silhouette recaps of the previous movie are unnecessary, and weirdly enough, a major revelation of this sequel is partially ruined by simply (re)watching the original film.

565028,Nathan,"_Candyman's_ story was intriguing and with spectacular visuals it is a decent watch, but for a horror film there was a significant lack of... horror. At no point in the film was there tension, dread, or a sense that I was being lead to a thrilling climax, it was more of a character study on Candyman. The character study aspect was great, I loved hearing the mythos of Candyman from different people in the community. The investigation into the backstory of Candyman paired with commentary on police brutality was really well done, but this was marketed as a horror film and it did not deliver. The cinematography was excellent, there were some really great shots utilizing mirrors and different angles but is that enough? In the end, this movie left me wanting much more.

565028,tmdb28039023,"I like the new Candyman. I don't love it, but I like it a lot. This film co-written and directed by Nia DaCosta wants to be the Wes Craven's New Nightmare of this franchise, and whenever it reaches that level, it hits a home run — especially when it comes to the eponymous monster, who has never been more sinister or menacing (Tony Todd, who originated the role in 1992, appears in a limited but effective capacity that transcends mere fanservice).

Speaking of 1992, DaCosta, who was three years old at the time, would not have been able to bring this project to fruition without the invaluable help of co-writers Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld, who know the material inside out and treat it with the same reverence that they it doubtless without inspired in them when they first encounter it in their teens. The filmmakers even get the comic relief right, and that’s not something too many horror flicks can brag about.

The original Candyman ""was a horror movie that scared with ideas and blood, instead of just blood"" (Ebert); the new version lives up to this standard, creating a foreboding atmosphere with practical special effects rather than CGI. 

For example, mirrors are Candyman's portal into our world, and the film makes the most of every reflecting surface — like when the protagonist, Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) gets into an elevator that somehow doubles as hall of mirrors.

The present co-exists nicely with the past (another touch as brilliant as bringing Todd back is using Virginia Madsen's voice on recordings made by her character in the first film) in Candyman, but the future is cause for concern. 

This is not a remake, much less a reboot, but there is a 'passing the torch' — or, in this case, the hook — which I fear is meant to pave the way for more sequels. I can only hope that DaCosta, Peele, and Rosenfeld really appreciate Candyman as much as I think they do, and that having restored his dignity, they allow him to ride off into the sunset with it intact.",2022-09-06T06:19:07.966Z,6.0,Candyman,2021
15516,tmdb17996075,"While a lot of people seem to praise this film as a horror gem, I myself consider it more like a drama… a mildly gruesome drama, but certainly not horror. I can enjoy horror films that don't contain some of the expected traits, like: jumps, creepy music, lots of screaming or tons of gore… but there has to be something to remind us that this is, in fact, a horror movie after all. To be honest though, there is a little bit of gore, that's true… but if the atmosphere isn't reminiscent of a horror film, the gore itself ends up being out of place. I was expecting something good, as I consider Wes Craven to be a very talented horror director, but I guess he simply wasn't in his prime back then. 

On 'Last House on the Left', the story revolves around a group of criminals, three guys and a trashy girl, who have recently escaped from prison. Two girls on her way to a concert, decide to stop by a house, looking for marijuana. The girls are kidnapped by these ex convicts, who torture them, rape them and eventually murder them in a brutal way. After butchering the two friends, the gang seeks refuge with the parents of one of the victims, who are completely unaware of everything. However, when the man of the house finds out about what happened to his daughter and who were responsible for what happened to her, he teams up with his wife to execute a gruesome revenge against his four guests.

The idea of two vindictive parents trying to avenge their dead daughter sounded promising and original for a horror film. It gives hopes for something tragic, dramatic and gruesome, but in the end, ""Last House on the Left"" ends up being more like a drama full of missed opportunities. One would expect a movie like this to reach its high point in the scene where the parents are finally able to avenge their daughter, but to my disappointment, this confrontation takes place only during the very last minutes of the film and it is shown in a very bland way. I can understand that minimalism works in certain films, and I don't expect all movies to offer some kind of gruesome shock value. The problem is that simplicity is not exactly something that one would expect from a film like this, where a certain amount of gruesomeness is almost mandatory. When the father finds out about what happened to his daughter, he looks completely numb. We never really get to see any signs of devastation, which would have added a well-placed share of drama to the story and would have made the last minutes much more powerful and tragic. My main problem with this film, however, is the fact that there are a few moments of pointless slapstick comedy. I mean, how can this be explained. It's supposed to be a horror film, but instead it is a horrible drama… with a few comedy moments? We see a girl getting stabbed and right after that, we see two dumb cops doing funny things for the audience to laugh. Honestly, I don't get it. I also find the banjo music to be inappropriate, as it works as a some kind comedy relief and it really doesn't make any sense in a movie like this. I am aware that sometimes, joyful music in horror movies is a way to create some kind of strong contrasting atmosphere, but in 'Last House on the Left', it simply sounded out of place. 

Most people seem to be impressed about the 'appalling gore' and impressive scenes, but I was mostly surprised by the lack of them. True, there are a few scenes that looked pretty brutal, but the gore is not striking enough to save the entire movie. I don't really understand what's the deal with the lame tag line that says 'To avoid fainting, keep repeating ""It's only a movie...It's only a movie...""'. I didn't find any parts to be that horrifying, to be honest. Even though I don't focus on the gore very much, I must admit that there are certain horror movies that make up for the weak plot, with a nice amount of carnage... unfortunately, this film is not one of those.

I give this movie 5 stars because even though I don't agree with the overhype, I still think it's a watchable drama with a few horror and comedy elements scattered around.",2017-02-14T23:50:04.677Z,5.0,The Last House on the Left,1972
10065,Wuchak,"_**Effective haunted house movie with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George**_

A young couple with three children buys an old, large house on Long Island in 1975. The house has a diabolic history, but they purchase it anyway because it's such a great deal. Will they make it out alive? 

I didn’t have high hopes for ""The Amityville Horror"" (2005) because I'm not a fan of haunted house movies and thus had not yet seen the original version. But I decided to give it a try due to Melissa George. The movie maintains a serious tone throughout and did not disappoint; it successfully piqued my interest in the whole Amityville Horror legend, which you can read about on the internet.

Some may accuse the film of ripping off aspects of ""The Shining"" (1980), but keep in mind that the original movie was released a year before ""The Shining"" while the books they were based on were both published in 1977. The difference is that “The Amityville Horror” was inspired by supposedly true events whereas Stephen King’s novel was purely fictional.

Of course this remake inspired me to see the classic version from 1979 with James Brolin and Margot Kidder. What I like about that one is that it takes its time to develop the characters in what is essentially a realistic drama topped off with creepy paranormal happenings. It addresses dark, ugly stuff but it actually has a warm heart (recall what George does in the final scene). This brisk 2005 remake is like the Reader’s Digest version, unsurprisingly upping the ante with the (clichéd) horror elements; it thankfully offers interesting details on the backstory of the house. I think they’re both worth checking out. If you prefer longer with more depth you’ll favor the original version whereas if you want something faster and more modern you’ll appreciate this one. 

Melissa George is a gorgeous woman and I enjoy watching her. Also on hand on the feminine front is Rachel Nichols, who played Tamara in the 2011 redo of ""Conan the Barbarian."" Rachel plays a hippie chick babysitter and she's perfect for the role. The babysitter is haughty and scoffs at the diabolic history of the house but let's just say she leaves as a true believer. This was a great sequence that perked my interest at a time it needed it (as I was starting to get bored by that point). In any event, I had to reassess my appraisal of Ms. Nichols after seeing her in this film as she won my appreciation. Meanwhile Chloë Grace Moretz plays the little girl; she was only 7 when the film was shot.

Ryan Reynolds as the husband is fine, but he seems TOO in-shape for the role. However, I'm sure the ladies appreciate it.

The film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot at Silver Lake and Salem, Wisconsin, with other parts filmed in the Chicago area of Illinois.

521029,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

I went to this movie not expecting much, but it never crossed my mind that I would be watching a film as bad or worse than The Nun. Honestly, going back, I was too easy on the latter since I didn’t exactly give it a massively negative review, which it surely deserves. However, Annabelle Comes Home really tries its best to be even worse. I hate it. I truly do. The horror genre has been exponentially growing, and it’s one of the two most popular genres right now (comic-book movies are the other), but this cheap, bland, cliche, predictable, and forgettable class of horror films is genuinely starting to annoy and frustrate me. The Conjuring Universe became just a set of silly spin-offs with entities that have no interest whatsoever and filled with extremely under-developed characters.

This is the third movie about Annabelle. Three films that address the powers of a freaking doll. Three! Very few people liked the first one, the prequel was admittedly a pleasant surprise, but this one is just atrociously bad. There’s not even a story. The whole movie is based on repeating almost laughable jump scares sequences. Literally, it’s all some sort of variation of the following:

Character walks down the hall -> A strange noise occurs-> Character slowly follows that noise -> Score starts to become louder -> Character checks something and camera closes in on the actor’s face -> Score becomes heavier and louder with the introduction of bass -> Another noise occurs behind the character -> Camera pans with the character and nothing happens -> Character continues to check on something -> Another noise, another pan, nothing again -> Score is reaching its climax -> Character continues doing the same thing -> Final noise, pan, and then one out of the two predictable jump scares happen: BOO! or Fake! … BOO! -> These are accompanied by a ridiculously loud sound that everyone in the theater is already bracing for because, guess what, everyone knows it’s coming -> Cut -> Repeat.

Except for the first 15-20 minutes, which are used to solely provide backstory to the three main characters, every single scene is an uninspired, unimaginative, anticipated, and tedious build-up to a jump scare that heavily relies on an exaggeratedly loud sound, and someone screaming. There’s no real narrative besides some character backstories which also have their own issues, especially one that involves an attempt at the start of a silly romance. Gary Dauberman tried to insert comedy in order to balance an otherwise monotonous film, but he failed miserably. Every supposedly funny moment is astonishingly cringe-worthy. It was his directorial feature-debut, and it shows.

It just feels like another cheap horror flick, filled with nothing but jump scares. One after the other. Every director in Hollywood could have done this, there’s no distinct style or a trademark shot. Nothing. I do believe that every movie takes a lot of work, and there are tons of people behind a film that genuinely give it their all every time. But Annabelle Comes Home feels so much like a pure cash grab, and I hate writing these words because every movie ever is ultimately an attempt to win money for the studios. However, this sequel never feels like it’s actually serving any purpose for the expansion or improvement of the universe it represents. It’s a horror flick filmed in just one location, something that I usually love because you can do so much with it, but this time it really seems that it was filmed entirely at a house because it was cheaper, hence more probability of profit.

There are two clear areas in the horror genre: the zone with films like Hereditary, Get Out and Us, where the story and its characters are what’s more important and scarier; and the other with movies like The Nun, The Curse of La Llorona or Annabelle Comes Home, where the only goal is to cyclically produce jump scare sequences with no narrative significance or impact. If you enjoy this latter type of films (which is absolutely okay, everything is subjective to personal preferences), then you’ll probably enjoy this movie. At least, people in my theater screamed and laughed pretty hard with no respect for the moviegoers that were trying to watch the actual film. However, if you’re sick of watching the same thing over and over and over and over again, please, for your own sake, skip it.

If it wasn’t for the truly amazing performances, this could very easily be the worst movie of the year (Serenity still holds that spot). McKenna Grace is phenomenal as Judy! Madison Iseman and Katie Sarife are also pretty good at their roles. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga barely have any screentime, but when they do show up, they definitely elevate the scene. Everything related to the production design is quite good, but technicalities will never save a film from misery if the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are thrown down the sewer. Also, I was shocked when I discovered that this is Rated R. There’s barely any blood or anything that justifies that type of rating. It’s another aspect that makes this film an even bigger disappointment.

In the end, Annabelle Comes Home is as poor or worse than The Nun. I can’t really decide which one I would watch instead of the other because I truly don’t want to watch any of these ever again. A brilliant cast might save this movie from a completely negative review, but it’s still an atrociously cheap addition to the horror genre. Everyone knows why this film doesn’t work: continuously repeating predictable, loud, and hollow jump scare sequences is not a story. I can’t feel invested in any of these scenes if they lack narrative impact or a minimum level of scariness. The fact that I barely even instinctively flinched (something I can’t really avoid) is a sign of how horrible this movie is. My expectations for The Conjuring 3 just dropped tremendously. Good luck, James Wan. You’re going to need it.

FD5 has unsurprisingly garnered mixed reactions, but even allowing for the fact that as an idea it's a series that can't get better, part 5 is a considerable step up from the very poor part 4. It also boasts a neat trick of the tail, where some ingenuity is used to bring the series full circle, with a glint in the eye and a bloody tongue in the cheek.

Once again the opening and closing credit sequences are superb, doffing its cap to what is undoubtedly a very popular horror franchise. The disaster that underpins the formula is one of the best to be staged, a mighty bridge collapse that terrifies and thrills in equal measure. Then of course it's same old same old, which you would think anyone venturing into watch would expect anyway. Acting is as usual mixed, but the deaths are up to the ingenious standard set throughout all the other films, and then a narrative twist at the finale arrives to seal the deal for a rollicking good time. We even get a welcome return of Tony Todd - Bonus! If it proves to be the final Final Destination then it's a fitting closure, because there is thought here.

55779,Wuchak,"***One of the best of the franchise, if not THE best***

The first ""Final Destination"" movie in 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, an invisible spirit. A group of people, mostly youths, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying the kids who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually an unlikely chain of events. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash, in the second a highway pile-up, in the third a rollercoaster mishap, in the fourth a racetrack calamity. In this fifth and most recent film (2011) it’s a spectacular bridge collapse and it’s probably the best opening tragedy of the franchise.

All of the movies in the series tell the same basic story with different characters and minor nuances; all of them are of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on your preference for cast members and the death sequences (and the locations). Other than these factors they're all basically the same.

""Final Destination 5"" features Nicholas D'Agosto as the main protagonist with Emma Bell as his blonde girlfriend. Tom Cruise lookalike, Miles Fisher, is also on hand while Ellen Wroe plays the gymnast. Meanwhile Tony Todd returns as the creepy coroner who seems to know more about the situation than he should.

While it’s true that you know exactly how this film will play out if you've seen the first four installments, or any of them, there are some highlights beyond the females. For one, this movie has a superb score and soundtrack, at least on par with the previous installment. Aside from featuring the most thrilling opening tragedy, there are several creative death scenes involving a gymnast accident, an Asian spa, eye surgery, a factory mishap and a restaurant altercation. This entry also throws in a unique twist that I’m not going to give away (but if you’ve seen the trailer you already know what it is). There’s an additional surprise at the end, which nicely wraps up the five-movie franchise.

The film runs 92 minutes and, like the first three films, was shot in the Vancouver area (the fourth film was shot in the East).

The plot follows the usual formula, with a group of people escaping a disaster only to find out that death doesn’t like being cheated. It doesn’t try to break new ground, but it delivers what fans expect. The directing is competent, with well-paced tension leading up to the signature over-the-top death sequences. The cinematography and visual effects stand out, especially with the impressive 3D work that actually enhances the experience instead of feeling gimmicky.

Outside of the thrilling set pieces, the rest of the movie just exists. The acting is forgettable, with performances that feel more like reading lines than embodying characters. The script is serviceable but nothing special, mostly there to connect the death scenes. The score does its job, adding to the tension without being particularly memorable.

I'm glad I was unaware, it made it much more enjoyable to see. If you plan of seeing this, go in as blind as possible - it's worth it.

The film does eventually (much of the film plays out similarly, mind) do something different with the plot, which is something I've wanted to see whilst watching the previous four entries. It involves Miles Fisher's Peter, a character that isn't perfectly written but is narrowly serviceable.

Nicholas D'Agosto is a decent lead, while Emma Bell also appears - first time I've seen her act away from <em>'The Walking Dead'</em>. Courtney B. Vance is solid in a smaller role, though P. J. Byrne's character is annoying; one like that is kinda a staple of these, tbf.

The effects are as good as across the opening three films, but are a step above <em>'The Final Destination'</em>. The main event looks the part and is fun to see, I'd say it's the best disaster in any of the sequels. There are also couple of well done deaths across the 90 minutes too.

1970,The Movie Diorama,"The Grudge begrudgingly latches onto croaky jump scares without logical cohesion. This, is an unusual horror to review. It’s rather uncommon for the same director, in this case Takashi Shimizu, to remake his own original film for an entirely different audience. Most would push their original creation onto the masses and convince them, with glorified persuasion, to withstand subtitles and invest the time into the chilling ghost story.

Yet Shimizu thought it would be apt to direct his own film again. Admirable? Yes, it ensured he received total creative control over the studio and producers. Necessary? No. Somehow, by remaking the exact story with essentially the same spine-tingling sequences, Shimizu downgraded the atmospheric aura of ‘Ju-On’, resulting in nothing more than a Japanese ghost boy releasing his inner cat and his ethereal mother croaking the life out of anyone who visits the cursed house. That’s the plot synopsis, right there.

Well, there’s a tad bit more to the mystery, however Shimizu’s insistence on haphazardly fracturing the narrative between present day and the past week consequently confused audiences rather than enthral. There’s no logic behind the structure. No foundational development. And certainly no characterisation. So the abrupt switching back and forth held no purpose, other than to illustrate a host of jumpy death sequences. Some effective apparitional imagery heightened the tension, particularly the surveillance footage sequence and bedroom scene that made me frightened of my own bloody duvet when I was an innocent boy, yet negated by the bland acting from every single actor.

Buffy has no more vampires to slay or Daphne has solved all remaining mysteries (take your pick...), and so she’s left wandering aimlessly around Tokyo with just one facial expression. Confusion. Pullman contributed nothing. And even Kayako herself, Fuji, was grossly misused during moments of tension-raising buildup. The final expositional flashback sequence, revealing to us why the house is now essentially cursed, was rushed and overwrought. Then concluding the entire feature on a frickin’ jump scare that looked cheaper than Kayako’s mascara. By the time the credits roll, you’ll be thinking to yourself “...why are these Americans in Tokyo anyway?”.

I just...don’t understand how Shimizu can make his remake so unprogressive in terms of quality. He had another shot at bettering his original, overcoming previous criticisms, yet failed miserably. I’m open to the idea that The Grudge is a product of its time, comprising of several horror traits that the previous decade had commonly exploited. And I appreciate it stuck to its J-horror roots. But damn, this has not aged well in the slightest. The core is there. I can visibly see the contents. Yet, either due to Shimizu’s inability to improve in directorial control or studio interference, The Grudge growled like a ghoulish kitten instead of exhuming a ghostly lion’s roar. Y’know, because Toshio opens his CGI mouth and a cat noise comes out? Urgh, whatever. Couldn’t think of anything...",2020-01-16T14:22:01.438Z,4.0,The Grudge,2004

With the help of experienced producers, Scott Cooper is able to generate a rich atmosphere and offer an intriguing monster, blending practical effects with minimal CGI perfectly, despite the low budget.

Accompanied by gorgeous cinematography, Keri Russell leads an interesting storyline focused on her traumatic past, but it ends up far too underdeveloped. The main plot features more generic plot points and a somewhat underwhelming yet visually satisfying ending.

Sadly, though, the rest of it all quickly becomes a bit too routine and the ending though quite well built up, is really a bit too predicable, brief and flat. The ""monster"" is seriously under-used by director Scott Cooper. A lot is left to our imagination, and to an extent that works - but unfortunately, regular fans of this genre will probably have far gorier fantasies that those we are eventually offered here. It's not a terrible film, it is decently paced and the young ""Lucas"" holds it together quite well, but sadly it offers very little for us (or the beastie) to get our teeth into.",2022-03-27T11:14:59.904Z,6.0,Antlers,2021
516329,r96sk,"Good story, good cast. It's enjoyable.

<em>'Antlers'</em> sets the right tone throughout and delivers in serving up a satisfactorily creepy flick. Keri Russell, Jesse Plemons and youngster Jeremy T. Thomas all give strong performances, they make for an interesting trifecta to watch - even if they aren't as fully fleshed out ss they could've been.

The horror aspects are done really well, as expected with Guillermo del Toro involved behind the scenes along with director Scott Cooper & Co. I also love films that make the locations come alive, where the place feels lived in and gritty, and this passes that particularly test with flying colours in my eyes.

516329,Nathan,"Antlers was a pretty big disappointment. The acting was lackluster, Keri Russell did okay, but I felt that Jesse Plemons was going through the motions delivering a poor performance. For a horror movie, this did not really feel scary at all. There is some cool characters designs during the transformation but the creature was pretty bad due to the heavy use of CGI. For a rated R film, there was not a lot of gore. I felt a lot of the kills were cut short or done off camera. This works when tension is built, but it wasn't and the payoff fell short. The story was generic and very predictable, character decisions were incredibly dumb in order to progress the plot. Combine all those issues with poor pacing and you get a tough movie to watch.

10730,talisencrw,"I had first seen the outstanding original of 'King Kong', still transcendent and captivating in its then-prescient use of special effects wizardry, then Sir Peter Jackson's recent remake, which was still extremely impressive. I had only heard horrible things about the 70's version, but I have come to admire Guillermin's films that I had watched, and look at that cast, so when I found the blu used, for a good price, I took a chance. It's definitely the runt of the litter, but is by no means a disaster. It's intriguing that they had originally wanted Joseph Sargent to direct with Peter Falk starring, and that Meryl Streep was considered for the role that eventually went to Jessica Lange. The changes they made to update Kong for the seventies were intriguing (as they wanted the script to be completely different from the Cooper/Schoedsack masterpiece), and I'm left curious, had Sir Peter Jackson chosen to make Kong a 21st-century schizoid apeman instead of doing a period piece, how that would have transpired. Even being Canadian, seeing the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center made me wistfully nostalgic. The only part of the film that was excruciating to watch was when Kong is made to perform for the American Bicentennial festivities, and at the ending, I was curious how Lange got down from the rooftop of one of the towers so fast. The answer probably lies on the cutting room floor, and the editing was probably rushed for release date, so no one must have noticed...",2016-01-16T00:33:53.558Z,7.0,King Kong,1976
10730,John Chard,"No, you're dead wrong. He was the terror, the mystery of their lives, and the magic.

1976 and I had already been spellbound and terrified by Jaws the year previously, I mean I was only 10 years old. Having been introduced by my film loving parents to the original King Kong from 1933, as soon as this update - in colour - was released, I stood in that queue for two hours to see it. I was spellbound, absolutely loved it, telling everyone in school or on the playing fields how great an experience it was. Those things never leave you, it's love of cinema with youthful eyes, and none of us should ever decry those moments as being ignorance.

Much later in life, watching this reworking of the Kong story becomes a battle to not extinguish those youthful fires. For now you can see just how poor the effects are, in fact just how much of a cheat (through research) that uber producer Dino De Laurentiis was as he put this onto the screen. Conversely, though, you can now see just how adult much of it was. The pic is full of sexual connotations and imagery. I mean look at Jessica Lange's first scene, she is introduced in a wet dress with erectus nippleus in full effect. I didn't remember that as a 10 year old boy...

There's some smart era concerns in the narrative, fuels, discrimination etc, and for sure the array of characters on show are 1970s intelligent. Hell! even the change to helicopter attacks instead of aeroplanes for the finale deserves respect - with the added sombre setting of the WTC twin towers now more attention grabbing - yet it's hard to get away from just how poor the production is. So as we may still shed a tear as the giant beast is felled by his love for a beauty, and we curse mankind for just not leaving him on his island, this is still poor film making that comes close to shattering fond memories of the young movie lovers back in 1976. 5/10",2019-06-12T12:48:32.682Z,5.0,King Kong,1976

10730,CinemaSerf,"OK, so it was always going to be very difficult to get anywhere near the 1933 version so I suppose the question here is - why bother? Well, they did - and what we have here is a bit of a shocker. The character names have been changed and the plot line updated to suggest this is more about oil exploration than beastie hunting, but thereafter the story is the same as the glamorous ""Dwan"" (Jessica Lange) becomes the apple of the eye of our eponymous giant ape. Taken deep into his jungle lair, the pair are pursued by Jeff Bridges (""Prescott"") and Charles Grodin (""Wilson"") who face all sorts of perils as they try to rescue the damsel in distress. The damsel, meantime, is beginning to fall for her over-sized beau and maybe she didn't actually want rescuing? We, on the other hand, certainly do. This takes far too long to get going and once it does, it offers us a very pedestrian interpretation of one of the most iconic love stories in cinema history with acting that is as about as wooden as it gets. The colour photography is first rate, but that also serves to rob the film of much of it's soul. This has a made-for-television look to it that is entirely devoid of any sense of menace or emotion. Lange screams like the best of them at the beginning, but there is nothing of the vulnerable about her characterisation. It doesn't help that the supporting cast are little better than a collection of daytime C-listers delivering a dialogue that really needed quite a bit more work had it hoped to engage us for 2¼ hours. Just because the visual effects made this possible doesn't mean that it should have been made.

10730,GenerationofSwine,"Usually I hate remakes... but I also used to not like DC. And then the heavily bashed New 52 came around, I was talking to a friend of mine, and the Flash in New 52 wasn't his Flash. He hated it out of principal.

I think that is what happened here, because the '33 film reached for the stars. The technology they had wasn't all there, and they did their absolute best with it to make the absolute best film they could. And it paid off, sometimes when you shoot for the moon you actually reach it.

This King Kong suffers from the 33 film. It's not a bad movie, but it's not really stretching it's neck out there and taking chances like the first one did. And... he's shooting at a distance with a fixed 50, that's one of those Hollywood photography things that irritates the heck out of me, but you can't see the auto advance attachment as well without a telephoto can you Hollywood?

You would think that people who work with cameras would take it more seriously in the movie.

Anyway, it's not a bad movie. The acting is fine, the plot is fine, the Fx are dated but era fine as well.... and it's entertaining....

... but it's grainy. Maybe it can be cleaned up in remastering, but they didn't use enough lighting and opted for film a little too fast for quality. And for someone like me, that's irritating as heck too.

Photography paid my way though grad school, of I can do better, they can do better.

It just isn't as monumental as the 33 film, and that it a high bar that makes it look bad in comparison.

I really liked this and I accept that I am in the minority. It has the Terry Gilliam comedic feel to it and it has the Terry Gilliam acid trip feel to it... and even at it's worst that is still absolutely entertaining and a pure joy to watch.

Someone mentioned wide angle work before and, yes, it has a lot of that wide angle close-up work that can only really be appreciated by people that thought they could out Thompson Hunter Thompson in their youth... wink wink nudge nudge, if you know what I mean.

The only real draw back is that Damon doesn't seem to fit in his role, and he doesn't really seem to fit in a Gilliam film...but surprisingly Ledger seems perfectly at home in that kind of world and you get the sense that he enjoyed acting the part as much as you are enjoying watching him act the part.

And then here and there you get a joke, a sight gag, a little hint that reminds you that, yeah, Gilliam was in Python wasn't he? That's something that you'd see in the Flying Circus shoved in there. Almost to the point where you can't but stop and wonder if he was channeling Idle or Chapman for some of the dialogue and physical humor.

4442,CinemaSerf,"Well it is a Terry Gilliam film so was always going to be a bit eccentric - but the idea that the legendary Brothers Grimm were actually grifters was actually quite an fun one. Assemble a couple of A-listers and we should have been flying. Except, well - we are not. Instead of having some amiable horseplay as they fleece the gullible and the unwitting, we find ""Jake"" (Heath Legder) and ""Will"" (Matt Damon) in a village where the children have all gone missing. The local grandee ""Gen. Delatombe"" (Jonathan Pryce) is on to their scamming and decides it's time to get them to prove their worth. Where are the sprogs? Well to save their necks, the not so dynamic duo have to deal with a seriously malevolent and fantastic foe in the ""Mirror Queen"" (the sparingly used Monica Bellucci) who wants to take over the world kind of thing. What now ensues are a series of typical Gilliam-esque escapades using a mediaeval backdrop to facilitate the borderline slapstick antics of the siblings trying to save their bacon. At times it is quite amusing offering some enjoyable parodies of established fairy tales, and the script does deliver a few entertaining quips as we go along but it seems unsure just who it's for. There's some darkness and good, old-fashioned, evil - but not enough of that. It's as if it was trying to be scary but hadn't quite the courage (to settle for a higher age rating, maybe?). As it is, it falls between two stools leaving us with an undercooked and overlong, slightly repetitious, series of frying pan to fire scenarios that even the engaging Ledger can't spin out for two hours. Damon doesn't really add much and Pryce is just in uniformed ham mode through his brief appearances. If you know the works of the brothers, it will make much more sense and some of it's observations about superstitions and the society in which the peasantry and gentry lived are quite witty, but they are all to often lost in a sea of mediocrity.",2024-08-12T05:50:45.895Z,6.0,The Brothers Grimm,2005
11152,Wuchak,"***Horror adventure in the Mayan jungle***

RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Carter Smith based on Scott B. Smith’s novel, ""The Ruins"" refuses to make the mistake of too many conventional horror flicks by NOT going over-the-top with the situation, the ""monster"" or the horrific thrills; films that do so are usually more goofy than horrifying. Take the ending of ""The Ruins,” which is different than the book and, in my opinion, better: In a typical horror movie there would've been a wild (i.e. thrilling but totally unbelievable) vehicle pursuit by the Mayans; not here. It's the BELIEVABILITY of ""The Ruins"" that makes it effective, which is reinforced by the acting of the five protagonists.

Speaking of whom, the main cast consists of Jonathan Tucker as Jeff, Laura Ramsey as Stacy, Jena Malone as Amy, Shawn Ashmore as Eric and Joe Anderson as Mathias, the German. The two girls and Tucker (Jeff) especially stand out. I found these protagonists likable and fairly fleshed-out for a 90-minute horror flick. For one, they're not the typical frat trash you see in so many horror flicks. Secondly, we see signs of character again and again, which I detail below.

Critics complain that the antagonists are decidedly un-scary, but that's one of the main points of the movie. Like 1963's ""The Birds,"" it takes something we see every day and are NOT scared of and turns it/them into a source of horror.

One memorable scene is when Stacy and Amy are in the dark bowels of the pyramid searching for a cell phone they keep hearing. What they discover is equal parts shocking, surreal and amazing (more on this below). Another memorable sequence is when Jeff & Eric are forced to perform a gruesome operation. The climax is also well-done and suspenseful.

While the story takes place on the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, it was surprisingly shot at Gold Coast and Tamborine Mountain, Australia, just south of Brisbane, which is on the East coast. In any case, the locations are spectacular.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The Ruins"" surprised me in light of the inexplicable mediocre ratings and incessant panning. It's an adventure story mixed with psychological horror utilizing something common and un-scary as the ""monster."" It features quality gore, excellent locations & props, quality performances and proficient filmmaking in general. Plus it takes advantage of the presence of Laura Ramsey and eschews the overdone cartoony-ness of too many horror flicks, which are more funny than creepy or horrifying. In other words, ""The Ruins"" delivers the goods.

The theatrical version runs 90 minutes and the unrated version 93 minutes. I viewed the latter.

GRADE: B+/A-

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)

The plants that live on the pyramid and what they are able to do spur a fascinating point: The animal kingdom spans the spectrum of worms to human beings. What about plant life? The plants at the Mayan ruins are obviously from the higher-developed end of the plant kingdom – they work as a team to obtain sustenance and are able to mimic sounds, like human voices and the ringtone of a cell phone.

I've heard complaints about how the protagonists constantly make the wrong decisions. Answer: The foursome had befriended Mathias and therefore trusted him. They wanted to experience some Mayan history off the beaten track. When the Natives suddenly arrive on the scene and brutally shoot one of their members in the head the only place for them to safely flee is the pyramid. At that point they're stranded because the Natives have the ruins surrounded. How is any of this a wrong decision?

Someone complained that the youths never attempt to escape the pyramid until it is basically too late, which supposedly defies logic. Answer: They're only on the pyramid for two nights and were waiting for help to arrive. Their only other recourse was to make a run for the jungle, which was impossible because the pyramid was surrounded by Natives with deadly weapons who already proved they would kill without mercy anyone infected by the plants. As such, the most logical thing to do was to wait for help and only make a run for it (to the jungle) if they absolutely had to, which is what happens. It sounds logical to me.

Another criticism is that the protagonists are imbeciles with little character development. I found them likable, as noted above, and there are numerous examples of character: They desire to experience the culture of the area and not just utilize their exotic vacation to party, like the average one-dimensional spring-breakers. Also, they refuse to leave Mathias for dead in the pyramid and the girls risk going down the same dubious rope that resulted in his fall. Moreover, Jeff insists on performing the gruesome task of cutting off Mathias' legs and Eric agrees to help even while the primitive operation causes him to vomit. Lastly, Jeff willingly sacrifices himself so that Amy has a chance to escape and she makes a bold dash for freedom. All this sounds like character to me.

Cam is the story of Alice, an online cam girl, who live-streams from her home studio. Just when things are looking good, her account is hijacked by her doppelganger. While the film is pretty interesting to start with, it loses some steam in the middle and leaves the audience with a whole bunch of unanswered questions, especially around the characters in the movie. It's a good one time watch that feels like a longish Black Mirror episode.",2019-02-13T11:02:07.761Z,5.0,Cam,2018
521935,The Movie Diorama,"Cam thrillingly records commentary on social media before glitching out at the climax. If ever there was a relatable topic in my life right now, or atleast for the past few years, it’s this one. The ever-growing addiction to social media, thirsting on the superficial requirement of “popularity”. That unnecessary attentive praise for the detailed work I’ve produced. Followers and likes on Instagram. Helpful votes on other review sites. It doesn’t matter. It is a regressive byproduct of artificial socialisation. Cam, for it’s introductory act, depicts the fundamental issue with modern reality perfectly. A young woman, who performs live shows on an adult entertainment website, rapidly escalates her controversial performances in an attempt to become the most watched entertainer.

In a society where individuals can get paid to showcase nudity online, with anonymous users tipping the entertainer, the addiction and lust for exploiting one’s self to earn a few hundred dollars has never been easier. Yet still within the guidelines of the law. Whilst it may sound monetarily heavenly to earn a living from the comfort of your own bedroom, it comes with potential consequences. Stalkers attempting to locate your abode. Anonymity running the risk of friends and family members discovering your explicit content.

However, it’s the psychological impact that Cam explores, in particular “Lola” and her manifestation of envy. She wants to be the best. The top girl. And she’s willing to do anything and everything to get that position. A modern issue for the youth of today who become addicted to technological entertainment such as gaming and adult content. Brewer’s engrossing performance enabled a subtle layer of sympathy to come through. It’s a relatable issue. Naturally, we resent her actions through a shocked expression, but empathise due to relatability. Obese old white men pleasuring themselves behind the security of their webcams. It’s gross, to say the least, yet a trend that does occur and is exploited. ChatRoulette is just one of many websites that harness the power of anonymity for sexual exploitation.

Then the direction changes as the plot progresses. Another entity is pretending to be “Lola” and locking the real “Lola” out of her account. This second act shifts the focus from thirsting popularity to conspicuous mystery. Who or what is pretending to be “Lola”? Old videos that have been downloaded and re-uploaded? A doppelgänger? Regardless, the story’s believability diminishes as the plot unfolds, but still remains captivating throughout due to the subject matter that is depicted. “Lola” as a character loses her dimensionality in order to focus on this imposter, detrimental to the thrilling nature of the narrative. Simply, it becomes more convoluted as it nears its climax. Then the third act commenced, and the mysterious reveal was exactly as I feared. Non-sensical. Illogical. Essentially, stupid. Initially what started out as a realistic subject study, concluded as a surrealistic mess. A dire shame considering how engaged I was throughout.

Nevertheless, Cam exceeded my expectations (although fairly low to begin with...). Illustrating a topic that should be discussed more frequently in today’s Internet environment. Unfortunately though, this live show was losing viewers with every minute that ticked by.",2020-01-16T13:33:15.575Z,6.0,Cam,2018

521935,RalphRahal,"Cam by Daniel Goldhaber feels like a blend of entertainment and a cautionary tale, something that manages to be relevant yet unsettlingly ahead of its time. The movie dives into themes of identity, privacy, and exploitation in the digital age, which are even more important today than they were in 2018. It’s a story that sticks with you because of its implications, but it doesn’t quite hit the mark in execution.

Madeline Brewer carries the movie as Alice. Her performance is believable and layered, giving the character a vulnerability and determination that keep you invested in her journey. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for the rest of the cast. While Melora Walters brought something intriguing to her brief appearance, the supporting performances fell flat, failing to add much depth to the story.

Visually, the film does a good job establishing its unsettling tone, with vivid neon colors and a chilling atmosphere. Some of the camera choices during Alice’s interactions with her family felt awkward and could have been more polished, though. That said, the chilling score in key moments worked well to heighten the tension, pulling you deeper into Alice’s growing paranoia.

The structure and pacing of the movie were solid. The transitions between acts were well-executed, building up to a tense and satisfying third-act climax. However, while the direction was consistent, the film didn’t fully explore the depth of its themes. It introduced big ideas but seemed to pull back from diving into the darker implications of its story, leaving some aspects feeling undercooked.

In the end, Cam is a movie with an important message and some strong elements, but it doesn’t quite stick the landing. It’s worth watching, especially for its relevance to our tech-driven world, but you might find yourself wishing it had done a little more with its bold premise. For me, the highlights were Madeline Brewer’s performance and the themes it tackled, even if the delivery could have been stronger. I’d say it’s a movie that balances on the edge of being a warning and pure entertainment, and that’s probably why it lingers in your mind after the credits roll.",2025-01-06T01:05:09.944Z,7.0,Cam,2018

8836,Wuchak,"**_Scully and Mulder search wintry landscapes for a modern-day Mengele operation_**

When an FBI agent goes missing in the Greater DC area, Scully and Mulder reunite to help the agency by enlisting the help of a defrocked priest with psychic abilities (Billy Connolly), which leads to grisly revelations. Meanwhile Scully is a practicing doctor intent on saving the life of a boy with a terminal disease.

""The X Files: I Want to Believe"" (2008) came out a decade after the first movie and six years after the final season of the original run of the TV series. Unlike “Fight the Future,” it doesn’t focus on the alien conspiracy but opts for a monster-of-the-week story. For those not in the know, the series walked the balance beam between these two.

Speaking as a very casual viewer, I preferred the MOTW segments because of their uniqueness and increased human interest. The alien conspiracy episodes struck me as boringly redundant even though fans of these segments understandably argue that the fate of humanity and its possible extinction is far greater than all the serial killers and monsters put together.

The fact that this second movie focuses on more mundane proceedings never bothered me. After all, we already have the first movie, why redo it? Can it even be topped? So, as far as I’m concerned, it was a good decision to take an entirely different route.

The inclusion of the psychic brings to mind the notable “Clyde Bruckman’s Final Repose” episode. This is combined with the basic plot of “Silence of the Lambs,” which involves detectives needing the help of a notorious outcast to find a missing female and capture the serial killer(s). The main differences are the snowy landscapes and the subplot of the boy needing experimental surgery to survive.

Being shot in British Columbia with key crew members from the defunct series, it has the tone of the show, just with a bigger budget and a longer runtime. As usual, the proceedings are mysteriously creepy, but lowkey with Scully and Mulder maintaining their renown dispassion. The exception is Scully’s dealings with the dying boy, who is basically her spiritual child.

Despite the generally listless air of the investigation (which was an issue with the entire series), there are interesting bits spiced throughout and the final act pays off, at least for me. I’m not so much talking about the grisly Frankenstein bits as Scully’s challenging situation, which is moving. There’s a spiritual depth with focus on moral transgression, penitence and possible redemption, not to mention boldly tackling one of life’s toughest questions: Why does a good God allow evil and suffering? Then there’s the addition of the biblical proverb: “It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings,” which of course ties into Scully and Mulder’s perpetual search for truth. 

I saw the Director’s Cut, which runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, and includes graphic, disturbing material cut to avoid an R-rating at the theater; the theatrical version runs about 3.5 minutes less. It was shot in British Columbia, specifically the Vancouver area (including Burnaby), and the Pemberton Valley region, including Riverlands, which is located a couple hours’ drive north of the big city.

""Old is one of those cases of a remarkably unique, intriguing concept failing to reach its potential due to an overall disappointing execution of too many ideas. M. Night Shyamalan delivers yet another divisive film, tackling deeper themes associated with our relationship with time and how the latter impacts people in distinct ways. The trademark final act revelation not only negatively affects the main theme of the movie but also raises dozens of plot and character inconsistencies, too many to handle. The acting is surprisingly as poor as some of the awful dialogues, despite great casting concerning the kid-to-adult transitions. The main family's arc is one worth investing in, but there are too many disposable, irrelevant characters. The technically accurate, detailed cinematography might not be pleasant for every viewer, but the editing definitely lacks some finesse. Unfortunately, I can't defend Shyamalan too much on this one...""

631843,Tejas Nair,"I liked Old not for its horror elements (at least the very little that it has) but for its themes about aging and regrets in life, something that hit home. There may be several flaws with this weird drama but the central theme of how we take life lightly when we are aging slowly really stayed with me. Recommended.",2021-09-26T06:24:52.368Z,6.0,Old,2021
631843,CinemaSerf,"I was really disappointed with this. It's an intriguing story from M. Night Shyamalan that is really let down by some lacklustre casting and a really lousy script. A few holidaymakers are taken to a beach where they discover that not only are they trapped there, but that they begin to age rapidly too... Can they escape? Sadly, I didn't really care - the characters are pretty unremarkable, and although the setting is beautiful the rest of it is slow and dull to watch. Rufus Sewell stands out as probably the worst of the bunch, but only marginally more so than an equally out of place Gael García Bernal who really did look like he was just waiting for his cheque to arrive. The last twenty minutes could have retrieved the situation had they be handled better, but what little jeopardy - or plausibility the story had had until then just evaporated. Shyamalan ought to have enough clout nowadays to ensure his quirky and intelligent stories are better presented in terms of talent and, especially given it's his own screenplay - writing too.",2022-03-27T18:48:19.245Z,6.0,Old,2021
631843,Peter McGinn,"There is a low-rent movie review site we all know that I go to when I am deciding whether to watch a movie or program. I don’t go there because it is full of great reviews and accurate ratings, but rather because sometimes I find it is more revealing why a production gets poor reviews that what the actual ratings are.

There were a lot of negative reviews of Old, but not for the most common reasons, such as racism, or political hatred of multi-culturalism. No it appears a lot of the negativity is aimed the director Shyamalen because this is not The Sixth Sense.

I thought the movie was okay, especially since I am not a horror fan at all. It isn’t great, but interesting enough to make it worth my time. I didn’t see the gaping plot holes or inconsistencies that reviewers mentioned but never got specific about. I didn’t feel the acting was bad. I mean, who knows how we would look and sound if life itself stopped making sense to us? If what happens to these people happened to me, I hope I could be forgiven for looking shell-shocked, acting lost, or staring uncomprehendingly at people around me. Seems like a perfectly reasonable reaction to me. We are jaded by the horror and suspense movies we watch, but would we make sense as people if we were living in one?

631843,Nathan,"Old is a very unique and interesting idea as a film. That is about the only positive thing I can say about it. The entire movie feels jumbled together, the pacing moves incredibly fast and choppy at some points, jumping from one small event to another. As a viewer you never get to sit in atmosphere of what has just occurred because it rips you away into another event. The writing in this film is simply not good. There is a ton of cheesy dialogue and character reactions that just do not make sense. I originally thought that the acting was just bad, but I think it has more to do with the material they are trying to work with. The cheesy lines can be fine if that was the style of film they were trying to make, but with the very serious and melodramatic tone it just comes off as awkward. There is a very weird and kind of off-putting direction that the story goes relating to the children that just made me uncomfortable as well. It is sad that this film had so much potential, and trailers really sell that potential, but what we were delivered was far from a quality film.

631843,tmdb51616167,"M. Night Shyamalan's latest film, ""Old,"" follows his signature style of delivering a captivating and mysterious storyline that keeps viewers engaged until the unveiling of a strange and often perplexing twist. The movie is visually stunning, with exceptional cinematography that elevates the beach setting and adds depth to the film's dynamics.

The story itself is intriguing, drawing audiences in and maintaining their focus throughout the narrative. However, as is characteristic of Shyamalan's work, the film takes an unexpected turn towards the end, leaving viewers feeling disheartened and frustrated by the conclusion. The disappointing ending can overshadow the film's positive aspects, leaving a sense of disturbance and dissatisfaction among viewers.

While ""Old"" may have its strengths in storytelling and visual appeal, the divisive nature of Shyamalan's twists and endings can detract from the overall credibility and impact of the film.

End Of Days is directed by Peter Hyams and written by Andrew W. Marlowe. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Robin Tunney, Kevin Pollak, Rod Steiger, Udo Kier & CCH Pounder.

It's the end of the Millennium and as 1999 draws to a close Satan (in human form played by Gabriel Byrne) is in town and looking for his bride. That bride is Christine York (Tunney), who 20 years earlier on her birthday had been chosen by Satanists to be the one for the spawning of the anti-Christ. Enter retired cop Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger), a suicidal security expert whose family were murdered, and who after being hired to protect an every day business man finds himself in a battle with evil itself. It's not just the fate of poor Christine that's now in his hands, but that of mankind too.

Arnold versus The Devil, you couldn't make it up could you? Well actually ""they"" did, but hey, what's wrong with pitting modern cinema's action super star against man's ultimate enemy? The answer is nothing wrong with it at all; as long as the expectation level is set at brain left at the door for some mindless popcorn fun. Which when one sees the premise on offer is all one can surely expect to see. Surely? Budgeted at $100 million by Universal Studios, of which $25 million went on the Austrian Oak's salary, End Of Days, contrary to some beliefs, made over double that when all sales were factored in. However, it was still a poor return for such a big block-buster and Universal were most disappointed in the returns. As was Schwarzenegger himself, who was hoping to launch a big movie come back after a run of sub standard movies had seen his stock fall. Throw in the Razzie nominations for Schwarzenegger, Byrne (who was also up for Stigmata) and Hyams, and it doesn't make particularly inspiring reading.

It's all very ridiculous, the film not the statistics, but End Of Days is a whole bunch of explosive, bonkers, action based fun. The flaws are many, not least that the plot is actually an adventurous reworking of T2: Judgement Day (Arnie playing it on safe territory one feels). While giving the big man some character depth was never going to be a good move considering his-ahem-range. Yet the film finds him on particularly good muscular form, machine gunning, shooting rockets and facing off against Byrne's (having a great time and playing it as it should be played) snarly, sarcastic Old Nick adversary. Tunney (wolf whistle that body) bats the eyes and screams as befitting the role, Pollak deserves better but runs with it in his usual dry dulcet way, while the wonderful Miriam Margolyes gets to kick Arnie's butt! Yes it's that kind of movie folks.

With dashes of grue and explosions aplenty it was never about trying to win awards. If ever a film does exactly what it says on the tin then this is it. Arnie V Satan, it is what it is, relax and enjoy. 7/10",2020-08-30T16:02:44.268Z,7.0,End of Days,1999
9946,Wuchak,"**_Solid action/horror with Arnie_**

The devil (Gabriel Byrne) comes to New York City to impregnate a chosen female (Robin Tunney) during the last hour of the second millennium to bring about the end of the world. The hope of humanity falls on an atheist ex-cop, Jericho Cane (Arnold Schwarzeneggar), and his partner (Kevin Pollak). Rod Steiger is also on hand as a no-nonsense Catholic priest.

""End of Days"" (1999) is a comic book action flick with horror/fantasy elements. It's not meant to be an accurate depiction of biblical eschatology. As such, it's useless to pick it apart on those grounds; just go with it and enjoy the ride. That said, there are some real-life subtexts and accurate biblical aspects. For instance, disillusionment due to the unjust death of a loved one (or any number of other tragedies) happens all the time.

The movie is R-rated not just for the violence and cussing, but because the filmmakers try to convey the devil's filthy lawlessness, like a threesome with a mother & daughter in a brief dream sequence (which may be ""reality,"" but it's hard to tell). Byrne has fun with the role of Satan.

As a holiday action blockbuster with Schwarzenegger ""End of Days"" delivers the requisite thrills where there's a massive explosion about every 12 minutes. These types of movies only work if the story and the characters pull you into their world and the film accomplishes this just enough.

It's no where near as good as the first two Terminator flicks, but it's close to being on par with the third one. Of course, ""End of Days"" is its own animal due to the apocalyptic, religious subject matter. On that note, the palette the filmmakers use is fittingly dark. The entire film takes place at night, mostly in the urban labyrinths of Gotham with additional sequences in Gothic churches, shadowy subterranean rooms and eerie woods.

The film runs 2 hours, 1 minute, and was shot in New York City and the Los Angeles area.

One would assume that however strong and resilient ""Jericho might be, the fact that his foe could cause people to spontaneously combust at will would have but paid to any resistance fairly early on. Nope - he keeps coming back to fight another day - and after a while, that just becomes a little bit dull and leads to an ending that is as flat as it is predictable. I suppose I ought never to have expected much jeopardy, and neither the acting nor the dialogue really do much to elevate this from a very average outing for Schwarzenegger that offers us plenty of action but totally underplays the more demonic aspects of the plot that ought to have made this just a bit darker and more interesting.

https://www.msbreviews.com

Zack Snyder is far from being a consensual director. Some viewers really love his work - Zack Snyder's Justice League was only possible due to passionate, hardcore fans - while others fail to understand the reasons behind the constant hype surrounding the filmmaker's projects. Personally, despite not belonging to his enormous fandom, I quite enjoy his work outside of the DCEU. From Dawn of the Dead to Watchmen, passing through 300, I hold these films in high regard. However, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is unquestionably one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of my life, and it's arguably the movie that triggered the beginning of the controversial general opinion about the director.

Usually, when people find themselves on a rough path, going back to their roots helps them get back on track, which is precisely what Snyder does here. The ""zombie apocalypse"" genre has been around for decades, but since the start of the new century, audiences all over the world were able to witness a narrative that was once unique and exciting become one of the most overdone, generic, formulaic pieces of storytelling. This last statement doesn't mean a few gems can't come out of it. From probably the greatest zombie film ever, Train to Busan, to the comedy classic Zombieland, there are truly great movies within the genre. So, where does Army of the Dead stand?

Somewhere in the middle, labeled as ""good fun"", which is all I expected from this Netflix film. Let me get one thing out of the way immediately: this looks, sounds, and feels like a Snyder movie. Countless over-stylized shots, long slow-motion scenes, an overwhelming amount of gore and blood, bizarre song choices, a two-hour-and-a-half runtime... for better or worst, no one can complain about studio interferences this time. Clearly, the famous director had complete creative freedom, and it shows through all of the film's positives and negatives. Fortunately, Snyder's filmmaking style not only fits well within this genre, but it also works for the simple, entertainment-driven screenplay.

A vast majority of viewers will press play in the hopes of receiving an action-heavy, fun, uncomplicated zombie movie with all the attributes that these flesh-eating characters possess. Except for a genuinely interesting storyline - though not new - concerning a specific type of zombies, everything else is pretty much what viewers have seen for the past two decades, which might be disappointing yet still highly enjoyable. From the way people can kill them to the time each infected person takes to become a zombie, every single cliche is present in this film. Honestly, none of them really annoy me unless they're repeated to exhaustion, which I don't believe Army of the Dead does that much.

The action sequences are all well-shot, but I did expect more from them. Most scenes are just characters randomly shooting, hitting insane headshots that viewers will just have to accept as something normal, which shouldn't be too hard, considering the recent action flicks. Occasionally, one-on-one or one-on-many combats ensue, and it elevates the excitement levels by focusing on that single character, but then it's brought down again by tiresome shootouts. Snyder asks the viewers to accept several dumb plot and character decisions, so it's always going to be a matter of how much you can take until it starts getting too much...

Personally, these logical issues don't really bother me - the ridiculous third act does push my limits, I admit. However, the lack of character development and overall care for everyone in the movie will always be a massive problem, especially when supposedly emotional, heartfelt moments end up having zero impact. I doubt anyone will be surprised to find out that people die in this film besides the zombies, consequently bringing tonal balance to the table. Obviously, not every character needs to receive a deep backstory and complex motivations, but it doesn't hurt to tell the viewers a bit about the people going into the danger zone so that the action sequences can carry more tension.

Without spoiling anything, there's a period in the movie where a deadly countdown begins, and everything that occurs from the starting time to the climactic moment just feels like any other scene in the film. The lack of tension and sense of urgency ultimately stops it from being one of the greats. Overall, it's an enjoyable zombie flick that offered me a blast of fun, but I still believe it could have been a lot better. Dave Bautista (My Spy, Avengers: Endgame) is the absolute standout, interpreting the only fully-developed character of the movie. Ella Purnell (Wildlike), Omari Hardwick (Sorry to Bother You), and Nora Arnezeder (Origin) are also quite good.

Finally, a point must be made about the relationship between studios and filmmakers. While I'm all in favor of creative freedom, there must always be a compromise between both parties. Snyder didn't gain fame for badly editing his films for no reason. Army of the Dead is, like most of his movies, unnecessarily long. The ""deleted scenes"" feature on Blu-rays doesn't exist for show-off. There's no film in the history of cinema where every single second recorded is pure gold, and runtimes are something studios can *help* filmmakers nail perfectly. In the end, I still consider this movie to move quickly through its straightforward story, so the excess screentime might not be that big of an issue for other viewers.

Army of the Dead brings Zack Snyder back to the zombie apocalypse genre, delivering an entertaining, action-driven story that will please most spectators. With his distinct, divisive filmmaking style completely unrestrained, for better or worst, the standout Dave Bautista and his team fight through the cliches, lack of character development, and excessive runtime to still offer plenty of excitement. The lack of tension and urgency hurt some of the last action sequences, but all are well-shot and packed with energy. Exceptional production design and VFX aren't enough to compensate for the predictably formulaic screenplay, especially when the only interesting zombie storyline is only partially explored. Overall, it's the definition of ""good fun"", so if your weekend has a two-and-a-half-hour empty slot, Netflix has my endorsement.

503736,Kamurai,"Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.

Probably the worst part of this is a trend I'm noticing from some movies I've been seeing recently where they show you what could be a better movie, in the movie.

While this starts with a ""patient zero"" style opening, they then skip past the movie I want to see to the last possible story from the opening event.

This movie does do a lot though, and has a lot of moving parts at any given time.

Batista is amazing, and everyone sort of gets lost around him, I can't tell if that's because he's a giant or if the movie wants it that way: the cast all does a fantastic job in their roles.

The movie does a couple things that I don't typically enjoy in movies: smart zombies, obvious traitors, and secret motivations.  It's like if SHIELD was in ""I am Legend"" and Black Widow kept tripping everyone else to get a rare Pokemon card.

That said, they show a fantastic amount of detail and complexity to a society that is barely explored, adding a wonderful flavor to the story.",2021-06-19T21:16:27.842Z,8.0,Army of the Dead,2021

Yet, try as I might I just can't seem to actually enjoy his films. I won't bother going into it because personally I'd prefer not enjoying a wacky Zach Snyder film then being mildly entertained by most mainstream fluff that seem crafted by algorithms.

503736,tmdb28039023,"The only good thing about Zack Snyder's masturbatory exercise Army of the Dead, is that it's comparatively shorter than his version of Justice League – but what movie isn't? An hour and a half short of a four-hour movie is still too long, especially considering that if everything we've seen before were edited out of the film, AotD would be a short feature.

True, we may not have seen a heist/zombie apocalypse movie, but we've seen dozens of heists and dozens of zombie apocalypses, and bringing the two genres together only serves to highlight the inconsistencies of each. But, let us start at the beginning. A US military convoy is transporting an unknown cargo from Area 51. The two soldiers in the cab of the truck debate the contents of the box (“the original draft of the Constitution written in the blood of the Founding Fathers… Amelia Earhart, long live "", etc.). Whatever it is, it’s highly inflammable, judging by how the truck instantly turns into a huge ball of fire the moment it makes contact with a considerably smaller vehicle.

Actually it is some kind of superhuman zombie that kills a bunch of soldiers and infects two of them. This entire scenario could easily have unfolded without the arbitrary and random explosion; the gigantic fireball is here solely because Snyder is such an impatient director that, in a 140-minute film, he can't wait even five minutes before blowing something to bits – the cinematic equivalent of premature ejaculation.

On the other hand, Snyder takes his time on plot points that we all know by heart. Hero is offered a job. Hero turns down job. Hero changes his mind and takes the job. Hero assembles team. And so on and so forth. So as to leave no cliché unused, the hero also has an estranged daughter, Kate (Ella Purnell); this, however, deserves some more attention.

Kate works in a quarantine camp for zombies, which is nothing short of a logic-defying concept. It is first established that the zombie bite takes immediate effect, transforming the victim into another zombie – and one does not quarantine a zombie; one shoots a zombie in the head and moves on.

Now, it has always been a habit of zombie movies to play fast and loose, depending on the requirements of the script, with the time it takes for a bite to kick in, but two wrongs don’t make a right. All things considered, AotD is a rip-off that makes it a point of ripping off bad ideas – which might be all right if it were a parody, but the movie is too bloated and excessive to ever be able to take itself lightly.",2022-08-28T22:27:42.756Z,1.0,Army of the Dead,2021

Sheer insanity at its ridiculous best! Zack Snyder goes all out with Army of the Dead by throwing as many plot ideas and spin-offs as he can to build his dream movie playground to play in for years at Netflix. Zombies plagues, zombie robots, time travel, multiverse, and who knows what else all flash across the scene and somehow don’t distract from the exciting central story. Dave Bautista leads a crew of expendable mercenaries to break into a vault in the middle of a zombie-filled quarantine zone once known as Las Vegas. The stand-out character in all this is Matthias Schweighöfer‘s Dieter. His comedy and goofiness breathe life into an otherwise wholly gritty film. The nonstop action and gore will satisfy any genre fan. Rather than the typical rescuing of a trapped loved one or VIP, I appreciate the new purpose for battling zombies - money.

503736,TwdPepper,"Disappointed. This movie is entertaining. It is good. Thanks to its big budget, it looks better than 90% of zombie films and has many great ideas. But it fails to take any of these ideas to the next level. The hierarchy of zombies is extremely interesting, and while we do get a sufficient amount of it; I wish this was one of Zack Snyder's epic ""Director's Cuts"" and it had gotten another hour or so to flesh it out. A handful of characters are also on the edge of greatness. They were awesome, but a little more time to shine could have done them wonders! But at least with these examples: what we got was still really good. My biggest issue is with the awesome action sequences that they tease but never deliver. A character has a favorite weapon—NEVER USES IT! A bunch of dried-up zombies are said to come back to life when it rains—IT NEVER RAINS! Why?! Why would you have these things in the movie if you aren't paying them off? These add to the overall feeling that this is a tame return to the genre for Snyder. His 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake is one of the wildest and scariest zombie films ever made. I have my issues with 'Dawn', but it clearly swung for the fences and accomplished everything it was going for. Army of the Dead doesn't feel this way. I appreciate that it isn't as bleak as 'Dawn', but it has so much less bite. Half of the kills are good, but the other half feel very basic or even happen offscreen!! A father/daughter subplot adds nothing new—and drags down the fun. Not just their relationship, but her entire involvement is seemingly just there to mess up the characters' plan. A tired and frustrating trope. Army of the Dead had all of the ingredients to become a classic. Instead, we settle.",2025-06-19T10:00:00.533Z,7.0,Army of the Dead,2021
8689,testr,"""If hellholes like this didn't exist, I'm sure you would invent one""

This film is almost, but not quite, exactly what the lurid title would suggest. It's definitely going for shocks as its primary source of horror, with a lot of this being truly hard to watch (I saw the uncut version, with animal cruelty intact, and I can see why they're cut from most versions, although there is a certain level of hypocrisy in condemning those scenes if you eat meat - and I doubt everyone who has ever criticised it were all vegetarian or vegan - unless you think that what goes on in slaughterhouses is any kinder that the animal slaughter depicted in this film, or that recording it somehow makes a moral difference), and has well earned its reputation for brutality. However, there's a deeper element to the horror. All the violence and cannibalism and rape is truly gruelling to sit through, but the scenes between those are, in their own way, just as grotesque.
As strange as it may sound, one film that this strongly reminded me of was The Searchers, reminding us of the fact that so-called ""primitive"" peoples are separated from us only by circumstance, that there is nothing making the ""civilised"" world inherently better, that the wilderness is always right next door.
Of course, this is rather problematic in itself. Because, in case the title didn't clue you in, this film has no interest in being sensitive. It is still exploitative. The question this film poses is more along the lines of ""are we truly any better than nasty primitive violent cannibalistic tribes?"", and certainly has far more in the way of contempt for civilisation than compassion for the supposedly ""uncivilised"". It's a common refrain by now; ""Cannibal Holocaust claims to be satirising exploration while also being itself exploitative"". This criticism... I understand it, but I feel it relies on a verbal sleight of hand. An ""exploitation film"" may contain the word ""exploitation"", but it is not the same as exploiting people.
That said, we mustn't forget that the native actors in the film genuinely were mistreated. They weren't treated all that much better by the real film crew than by the in-movie one. Some of the stuff that happened on the set of this makes Kubrick-making-The-Shining look like the Buddha. There's no real way around it, the set of this movie was an abusive environment. The director of this movie, Ruggero Deodato, is an abusive arsehole who was particularly nasty to women and native actors. Fuck him.
And yet, I still can't help but be fascinated by the film, even if I don't necessarily want to ever see it again. There is certainly some craft to this. From Riz Ortolani's beautiful score providing an actually effective counterpoint to the incredibly brutal scenes of horror to the raw documentary style that strips everything down to the most naked barbarism, this is a film that has an aesthetic you won't see in many others, at the very least. Even now ""found footage"" is as family a horror subgenre as ""monster movie"" or ""slasher"", this, along with Blair Witch, still holds up as something special. Sure, the framing device may be unorthodox in modern examples of the genre, but the bits that are in that style genuinely do feel like we're watching somebody's last moments on film. The acting is... variable, which sometimes breaks the illusion, but, perversely, it helps in a way that a lot of the cast seem genuinely uncomfortable, so don't HAVE to act for a lot of it.
And yes, this is very influential. You can see all the familiar tropes of the found footage genre, right down to the cast being massive arseholes that you kinda want to see eaten by the end. Yes, as I say, the framing device is unorthodox, but it's not like there's no reason for it to be in the film or anything. It goes without saying that it would be a very different film without it, and probably wouldn't have nearly as many reviews on here. The footage story is of course where most of the scenes that fans of ""extreme cinema"" remember are from, but the frame story is part of the reason why this still an independent cult following outside of people who will simply watch anything with enough mutilation in it. The most targeted part, in my mind, comes when we see the footage of the in-film documentary ""The Last Road to Hell"", and the opening credits are in the same style as the actual opening credits to this film.
But there comes a point if we have to ask how genuine this is? Is this film truly a critique of colonialism and exploitation, or is it just trying to make pretensions to something more than a schlocky cannibal flick? Is it just trying to make you feel less guilty for watching it, or more guilty?
I don't think there are any easy answers. This is a wholly unattractive film, and knows it. The cruelty is both a means to and end and an end in itself simultaneously.
All in all, Cannibal Holocaust isn't necessarily a film I can in any good concience recommend, because my God is it hard to watch, nor can I really say I'm even glad it exists, knowing what went on behind the scenes, but I can say the world of cinema would lose something tangible if this film were deleted from history. For better or for worse.
OK, so today I've been writing various quick reviews-from-memory of various randomly selected movies I've seen before, and this was meant to be one of those, but ultimately this review turned out way longer than expected, so I hope I actually said anything worthwhile in that whole length rather than just rambling. Not sure why this of all films got the extended review for today, but I guess it is a film that sticks in your mind, and due to its nature it's not something many people are willing to see so it's easier to say things that haven't been said ten billion times already, so I guess the combination of those two factors resulted in me feeling I had the most to say about this one. Whatever the case, I hope I actually DID say something worthwhile lol.",2022-07-12T20:08:48.537Z,7.0,Cannibal Holocaust,1980

Kevin Williamson, hot off of the success of his screenplay for Wes Craven's Scream, here adapted the Lois Duncan novel with mixed results.

A bunch of pretty teenagers in a coastal fishing town run over a man in the road and try to cover it up. Not a wise move at the best of times, even more so now as the victim, a hook wielding fisherman, is coming to get them.

And that's pretty much it. Williamson adds some humour into the play, while director Jim Gillespie plays his shock tactics well and keeps the pretty young cast annoying enough for us to want to see the fisherman guy enact revenge.

It sadly gets away from itself in the last quarter once the stalker is revealed, and in truth there's very little imagination gone into the whole pic. But it's a decent night in with beer and popcorn for those after a short sharp shock type horror. 6/10",2015-10-21T01:24:32.419Z,6.0,I Know What You Did Last Summer,1997
3597,Wuchak,"_**The guilt will haunt you and maybe even KILL you**_

Released in 1997, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" takes place in coastal North Carolina where a group of just-graduated teens experience a tragic event and compound it by foolishly reacting. They swear to carry the secret to their graves, but the next summer it becomes clear that someone knows their secret and murders start piling up. The teens are played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. Also on hand are Johnny Galecki, Anne Heche and Muse Watson.

This movie is full of slasher clichés, like the killer who's always in the same garb (this time a fisherman's slicker outfit), the slow-methodical walking of the killer (never running) and the undead dead. There are also two blatant ""Yeah, right"" scenes (noted below). Thankfully, it makes up for it by the stellar coastal locations (strangely shot on BOTH East and West coasts), a quality cast, some effective sequences and the potent moral on haunting guilt that slowly kills ya. The immediate aftermath of the opening accident is particularly well done.

The film runs 99 minutes and shot in Southport, North Carolina, and Jenner, California, and nearby regions of both coasts.

GRADE: B or B- (6.5/10 Stars)

***SPOILER ALERT*** (DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM)

Here are the two eye-rolling scenes:

1. The sequence where Max's corpse is found in the trunk with the crabs. It couldn't have been an illusion since Helen didn't yet know Max was dead, so it must've really happened. If so, how would the slicker-killer get the trunk cleaned-up so quickly with no one seeing him in a neighborhood in broad daylight? Also, how did he even get into trunk? Did he have his own personal key? The sequence is just too far-fetched.

2. After Barry is murdered by the killer at the pageant how does he know that the cop and Helen would be driving down the alley by-pass an hour or so later? (I realize the street was blocked off and he might've been the one who set it up, but how did he know this would be the precise route taken by the cop and Helen? And how would he even know Helen would be riding with the cop? It's not like she wouldn't have other friends & family in town with whom she could ride. Anyway, wouldn't people living in the downtown area or other passersby notice a man in full-slicker garb working on his truck?

Sequences like these take intelligent viewers right out of the story, which explains Roger Ebert's response: ""After the screening was over and the lights went up, I observed a couple of my colleagues in deep and earnest conversation, trying to resolve twists in the plot. They were applying more thought to the movie than the makers did.""",2022-02-13T18:51:14.150Z,6.0,I Know What You Did Last Summer,1997

3597,tmdb51616167,"The ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" franchise has left a lasting impact on audiences, with the first film being particularly noteworthy for its thrilling and grounded portrayal of a vengeful antagonist. Ben Willis stands out as a compelling and underrated character, bringing a sense of realism to the story without delving into the supernatural realm. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. deliver captivating performances, drawing viewers in with their charisma and acting prowess.

The sequel, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" takes the characters on a harrowing adventure to an island, adding another layer of suspense and terror to the franchise. While some may overlook this installment as a credible sequel, the addition of Brandy Norwood as Carla contributes to the film's appeal and intensity.

However, the franchise takes a misstep with ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer,"" introducing supernatural elements that detract from the grounded nature of the original films. This departure from reality diminishes the impact of the storyline and characters, leading to a disappointing third installment that lacks the involvement of the main cast.

The television series based on the franchise offers a different but enjoyable take on the story, adding credibility and entertainment value to the overall franchise. While the series was cut short, fans are eager for a reboot that promises to bring fresh energy to the familiar tale. It is hoped that the original cast will return, providing a seamless continuation of the beloved saga akin to the success of the ""Scream"" franchise.",2024-09-03T02:28:35.773Z,7.0,I Know What You Did Last Summer,1997
3597,r96sk,"<em>'I Know What You Did Last Summer'</em> manages to satisfy, even if it isn't one of the strongest slasher flicks out there. The plot gets messy and the deaths don't stick out that much, though I was still suitably entertained. It is paced quite well, the run time flew by for me.

That's even with me having seen it before, way before I logged my thoughts online but I still remembered most of it. The cast, for me, are the best feature of this movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt is the standout, comfortably the best performer here in my opinion. Sarah Michelle Gellar is good too.

The dudes aren't as memorable, Freddie Prinze Jr. is decent but Ryan Phillippe's character is lame. It's interesting to see D. B. Cooper, I mean Muse Watson, involved though.

This was a hit movie at the time, and other than the Xenos design, I'd say it is still a pretty good movie.  The ""anti-Jaws"" approach of showing the monster off is really cool as the premise is largely how detailed and dangerous the xenos is, but the approach removes a lot of the suspense in the hunting and subterfuge, almost humanizing her as ""hunted by the evil government entity"".

While it would be a much different, and arguably better, movie to do something more like ""The Thing"", that she only has one human mask sorts of outs her, making it more like a spy movie, and I think they did really well with that in mind.

It just lacks the level of nuance and hidden information that spy and thriller movies tend to have.

It's much closer to ""Aliens"" than ""Alien"".",2020-10-18T18:38:30.454Z,7.0,Species,1995

Released in 1995, ""Species"" chronicles events after SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) receives a transmission from outer space detailing alien DNA structure, along with instructions on how to splice it with human DNA. This gives birth to Sil, a girl (Michele Williams) who escapes and rapidly grows into a statuesque blonde (Natasha Henstridge). Government agent Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) assembles a team to locate and destroy Sil before she finds a mate and breeds. The team includes a tough mercenary (Michael Madsen), an anthropologist (Alfred Molina), a molecular biologist (Marg Helgenberger) and an empath (Forest Whitaker).

I developed a bad attitude toward ""Species"" for years due to Roger Ebert's scathing review, but changed my mind upon giving it an openminded viewing. This is a top-of-the-line sci-fi/adventure/horror flick. People look down on it because of the nudity and mild sex scenes, which prompts them to disdain it as exploitive and trashy. While Natasha Henstridge is a good-lookin' woman, she doesn't do anything for me (she's not my type) so I was able to totally overlook this element and focus on the film's other attributes.

For one, the score by Christopher Young is excellent. Secondly, the A-list cast is a highlight and their characters are increasingly fleshed-out in the story. Lastly, while people understandably write-off the movie as a Grade B plot with Grade A production, there's more here than meets the eye. For instance, Sil is the innocent pawn of the extraterrestrials who sent the DNA. Another example is the excellent character of Dan (Whitaker) whom whiners complain about as ""always pointing out the obvious"" when the movie shows over and over that he DOES know things the others don't and they ignore him to their own peril. Dan is necessary so that the team knows what direction the creature takes on repeated occasions; without Dan we'd see them pursue one boring dead-end after another.

While snobby film critics love to hate ""Species"" it's a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi adventure with an interesting moral and a great cast of characters. If you like films like ""Alien,"" ""Aliens,"" ""Terminator,"" ""Terminator 2"" and ""Predator"" you'll probably appreciate it. It may not be as good as ""Aliens,"" ""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2,"" but it's on par with ""Alien"" (and marginally better IMHO) and superior to ""Predator."" Then again, it depends on what you want in a sci-fi blockbuster. As far as I'm concerned, ""Species"" delivers the goods.

The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in the areas of Los Angeles and Brigham City, Utah.

The theory is postulated by the mercenary and biologist that the alien DNA was sent as a biological weapon, a ""weed killer"" from outer space to wipe out the galactic weed of earth or, more accurately, the human race that inhabits it.

If they had, then perhaps we could have avoided the mayhem and brutality caused when they create ""Sil"" (Natasha Henstridge). She is the product of alien and human DNA and can morph between a beautiful woman and a savage killer in the blink of an eye. Of course she escapes from the high security facility that couldn't keep a cow out, and is soon on the search for a man. Not any particular man, just one who can help her make a baby - and believe me, that's not a good plan! The scientists - led by ""Lennox"" (a rather charmless Michael Madson) and ""Baker"" (Marg Helgenberger) are on her trail but can they stop her before she finds a willing partner? To be fair, the visual effects - very ""Terminator"" (1984) style - are actually quite effective but the acting, especially from the always hammy Ben Kingsley, and the scripting are very bottom drawer. There's some imagination with the look of the film, but the delivery is pedestrian across the board before an ending that has an inevitability to it that I found a bit predictable. Not terrible, but a real missed opportunity that had it been cast better and just spent a little more time on the a more substantial story, could have created a better sense of menace and even a little (dark) humour.",2023-05-21T09:27:58.761Z,5.0,Species,1995

7340,RalphRahal,"Brian De Palma's Carrie (1976) remains an iconic adaptation of Stephen King's novel, blending psychological horror with deeply human themes of alienation and vengeance. The film’s portrayal of high school life, social cruelty, and supernatural terror is deeply affecting, resonating with audiences even decades later.

From its infamous opening locker room scene to the chaotic prom climax, De Palma's direction demonstrates a masterful control of mood and pacing. The visual style, characterized by long takes, slow motion, and the daring use of split-screen during the prom sequence, creates a cinematic experience that is both intimate and expansive. These techniques pull viewers into Carrie’s inner world while amplifying the horror of her ultimate revenge.

The production itself is a marvel for its time, achieving a balance between the surreal and the real. The careful choreography of the prom scene, where chaos is unleashed in a ballet of destruction, reflects De Palma’s meticulous eye for detail and his ability to innovate under pressure. It’s worth noting that some of the film's most memorable sequences, like the split-screen prom massacre, arose out of budgetary constraints—proving De Palma's ability to turn limitations into creative triumphs.

The performances elevate the material further, with Sissy Spacek's portrayal of Carrie standing out as both vulnerable and haunting. The supporting cast effectively embodies the oppressive social dynamics of high school, creating a believable and suffocating environment for the protagonist.

Understanding De Palma’s personal history adds another layer to the film’s intensity. His exposure to the visceral realities of his father’s work as a surgeon shaped his comfort with the graphic and the grotesque, evident in the film’s bloody moments. Additionally, De Palma's own experience trailing his father to uncover an affair—an event he later described as formative—infuses his work with themes of voyeurism, psychological tension, and human frailty. These personal elements lend Carrie a raw authenticity that transcends its horror genre trappings.

Despite the controversy surrounding its explicit content, Carrie avoids gratuity in favor of storytelling. De Palma’s bold choices underscore the film’s central themes rather than overshadow them, making it as much a character study as a tale of terror. The film's success helped cement his reputation as a provocative yet deeply skilled filmmaker, unafraid to explore the darker corners of human experience.

Revisiting Carrie highlights why it remains a classic. Its blend of compelling performances, innovative cinematography, and psychological depth sets it apart not only from other adaptations of King’s novel but also from modern horror films attempting similar themes. De Palma’s ability to channel his personal experiences into his art gives Carrie an emotional resonance and cinematic flair that continues to captivate audiences.",2024-12-14T16:55:31.532Z,8.0,Carrie,2013

Splice is a tricky picture to evaluate, for its ideas are superb. One could argue that it brings a new petri dish full of meddling scientists facing the consequences of their actions, while conversely it justifiably feels like a Cronenberg knock-off.

Psychological discord is in abundance, with its slants on skew-whiff parenting giving the pic a dark fascination, and as unpleasant as the male fantasy angle is, it does hold a morbid interest factor.

Yet come the final third the makers let things run away from them, the bonkers dangers of tampering with science giving way to daft schlock, even managing to be distasteful in the process - while the finale is a weak attempt at a ""TBC"" cliff hanger.

Lead cast members are turning in good perfs. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley as the meddling science couple hold court well, and Delphine Chaneac as the Chimera splicer of the piece really nails all the various emotional strands required for a tricky role.

Director Vincenzo Natali  has shown with Cube and Cypher he has something to offer the horror/sci-fi splinters of film, but this is a mixed bag.

I never did really get why Brody was ever successful in the first place and here there is no chemistry between him and Polley; the storyline which could have been challenging and thought-provoking instead borders on the absurdly far-fetched and the ending couldn't really come quick enough as we really do struggle to reach any sort of a satisfactory conclusion - either from a personal or a scientific perspective.

9286,John Chard,"Roller Toaster.

Final Destination the series moves into its third instalment without really changing the formula that was working for it. Here the opening disaster involves a Roller Coaster crash that is brought via a premonition to Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). As in the previous two films, the visionary and some friends get spooked and get off the coaster to find it actually does crash and a bunch of horrific deaths befall all those on board. Sure enough the survivors start being killed off in equally gruesome ways, it becomes apparent that the old grim reaper is out to claim the deaths that were denied him.

The opening section of FD3 is superb, the credits roll to a back drop of various carnival/fairground attractions that offer up foreboding terror, all backed by an eerie rumbling musical score. Then the crash itself is excellently stage, so much so that anyone frightened of Roller Coasters can point to this as a reason why! Then we revert to type, the youthful cast get bumped off in more ingenious ways, with more gore and lashings of dark humour pumped up this time (the use of Love Roller Coaster by The Ohio Players is genius). The narrative drive this time involves photographs, which is a nice touch and overcomes the triteness of some dialogue exchanges.

It's a safe entry in the series, and it boasts in Winstead the best young lead actress of the whole franchise. As with all horror films - franchises, some will love it and some will hate it, but ultimately it really does exactly what the previous two films did. So if a fan of those then this does a good job as well.

Unfortunately, in this 3rd installment it seems that the producer took some shortcuts and produced the all to common teenage splatter movie. That is, do not bother about spending time on a decent script nor any acting capabilities to talk about. Replace all that with some wiggling boobs and behinds to appeal to the not too intelligent part of the teenage movie going audience, kill of a few of the bearers of said boobs and behinds at regular intervals in an increasingly goory and spectacular way and you’re done.

I kind of like the goory and violent bit, it’s supposed to be a horror movie after all, but I would prefer that it was strung together in something that at least can be said to be semi-intelligent way.

9286,Wuchak,"***Decent, but now formulaic entry in this 'Dead Teenager' series***  

The first ""Final Destination"" movie in 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, as an invisible spirit. A group of people, mostly teens, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying the kids who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually an unlikely chain of events. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash, in the second it's a horrible highway pile-up while in this third entry it's a rollercoaster mishap.

All of the movies in the five-film franchise tell the same basic story with different characters and minor nuances; all of them are of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on your preference for cast members and the death sequences (and the locations). Other than these factors they're all basically the same.

Released in 2006, ""Final Destination 3"" has a quality doe-eyed heroine or 'final girl' in Mary Elizabeth Winstead. There are some other worthy female cast members, like Alexz Johnson, Chelan Simmons, Crystal Lowe and Amanda Crew. These five ladies represent perhaps the best assortment of women in the series yet.

While it’s true that you know exactly how this film plays out if you've seen the first two installments, or any of them, there are some highlights beyond the female cast. For instance, the rollercoaster accident is thrilling and rings true in light of real-life mishaps at amusement parks. There’s also a horrifying tanning booth death sequence, which was done better in “Urban Legends: Bloody Mary” from the previous year (2005). Another death scene occurs at a warehouse where two of the protagonists work. I also liked how an extended sequence outside the teens’ school takes place in the rain, which shows attention to detail (or making the best of a rainy day during shooting, whatever).

For me, what makes these movies kinda dull is the fact that it's impossible to cheat Death. Sure, you can escape it here or there, but Death's been in business for millennia and expertly knows what he's doing. As such, everyone's gonna die except maybe the 'final girl,' who will most probably die in the sequel.

In case you’re interested, there's an interesting 20-minute documentary about ""Dead Teenager Movies"" on the 'extras' disk with Roger Ebert being a highlight.

The film runs 93 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver area, as were all the Final Destination flicks, except the fourth one.

376865,Gill-Man,"A dazzling sci-fi epic that holds nothing back in its entirety. Claire denis' vision is an unrelenting masterwork packed to the brim with nerve-shredding fear and and a pulse-punding gravitational pull that sucks in the viewer and never lets go until the very end.

I found this film more of a meditation on what makes humanity's backbone so spontaneous; there are many plot points and elements that seem justified by the notion that humans are unpredictable creatures and as we evolve, we'll continue to be more and more focused on following through with our own morals. There's lots of brutality on display on this film and it all feels very contained until one moment near the film's middle that's very quiet and equally contained but that sends the entirety of the cast into chaos. It's almost a testament to the question of whether authority figures actually *do* something for prisoners or instead just make their rage build up further and further until it explodes harder than a dick in the Fuckbox.

I think the best way its themes can be described is by a quote from the film itself: ""The sensation, moving backwards, even though we're moving forwards, getting further from what's getting nearer."". The way it presents human evolution as moving forward literally but moving backward metaphorically is more than just smart: it's genius. But the film also tackles issues pertaining to erotic pleasure and abuse of that pleasure; the entire Fuckbox scene is just a nightmare on all levels and it made me want to just die from the shivers it sent down my spine.

That is to say, an object fired vertically upward from the surfa__ce of the star with a velocity of less than 1,000 kilometres per second would be dragged back by the gravitational field of the star and would return to the surface, whereas an object with a velocity greater than that would escape to infinity._

> _When the star had exhausted its nuclear fuel, there would be nothing to maintain the outward pressure, and the star would begin to collapse because of its own gravity. As the star shrank, the gravitational field at the surface would become stronger and the escape velocity would increase. By the time the radius had got down to 10 kilometres, the escape velocity would have increased to 100,000 kilometres per second, the velocity of light. After that time any light emitted from the star would not be able to escape to infinity but would be dragged back by the gravitational field. According to the special theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than light, so that if light cannot escape, nothing else can either. The result would be a black hole: a region of space-time from which it is not possible to escape._

>_If information were lost in black holes, we wouldn't be able to predict the future, because a black hole could emit any collection of particles. It could emit a working television set, or a leather-bound volume of the complete works of Shakespeare, though the chance of such exotic emissions is very low. It is much more likely to be thermal Radiation, like the glow from red hot metal. It might seem that it wouldn't matter very much if we couldn't predict what comes out of black holes. There aren't any black holes near us. But it is a matter of principle. If determinism breaks down with black holes, it could break down in other situations. There could be virtual black holes that appear as fluctuations out of the vacuum, absorb one set of particles, emit another, and disappear into the vacuum again. Even worse, if determinism breaks down, we can't be sure of our past history either. The history books and our memories could just be illusions. It is the past that tells us who we are. Without it, we lose our identity._

>_It was therefore very important to determine whether information really was lost in black holes, or whether in principle, it could be recovered. Many people felt that information should not be lost, but no one could suggest a mechanism by which it could be preserved. The arguments went on for years. Finally, I found what I think is the answer. It depends on the idea of Richard Feynman, that there isn't a single history, but many different possible histories, each with their own probability. In this case, there are two kinds of history. In one, there is a black hole, into which particles can fall, but in the other kind, there is no black hole. The point is, that from the outside, one can't be certain whether there is a black hole, or not. So there is always a chance that there isn't a black hole. This possibility is enough to preserve the information, but the information is not returned in a very useful form. It is like burning an encyclopaedia. Information is not lost if you keep all the smoke and ashes, but it is difficult to read._

>_What does this tell us about whether it is possible to fall in a black hole, and come out in another universe? The existence of alternative histories with black holes suggests this might be possible. The hole would need to be large, and if it was rotating, it might have a passage to another universe. But you couldn't come back to our universe._

A science fiction thriller from Claire Denis? The uncompromising darling of French art house cinema, adored by critics and met with general puzzlement by audiences? And it's in English? And it stars the guy from _Twilight_? You have to be making this up.

Not at all. However, as intriguing as that may sound, it's a deceptive overview. Yes, it is Denis's first English-language film, and yes, it is set in space, but it's a science fiction film in name only, in much the same way as _Trouble Every Day_ (2001) is a horror film in name only, and it has more in common with Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968) and Andrei Tarkovsky's _Solyaris_ (1972) than with anything in the _Star Trek_ or _Star Wars_ franchises. And just for the record, the guy from _Twilight_ has developed one of the most eclectic recent CVs of any actor in Hollywood. The long and short of it is that Denis has not sold out, and _High Life_ is as multiplex-friendly as anything in her _oeuvre_ (which is to say, not in the slightest). And although she's ostensibly working within genre parameters, the film covers many of her more familiar themes - the darker aspects of desire; the notion of being an outcast; parenthood; the inescapability of death; the beauty of the human body; the relationship between violence and sexuality. The presence of Robert Pattinson will probably draw in a lot of unsuspecting folks, who will have no idea what to make of Denis's slowly paced existential musings, resulting in a slew of asinine ""_worst film ever_"" reviews. But although it's not Denis's best (that remains either _Beau travail_ or _Les salauds_), it's a fascinatingly poetic and original film that is utterly uncategorisable - a space thriller about a mission collapsing in on itself; an angry ecological allegory positing that we don't have a huge amount of time left to save the planet; a study of what it is that defines our humanity; an analysis of the psychological ramifications of long-term incarceration; an erotic skin flick obsessed with bodily fluids; a metaphor for the perils of imperialism; a fable on the subject of paternity; a story about loneliness and grief; a look at the inherent contradiction in the fact that humanity is constantly reaching for the infinite whilst tied to an irreversibly decaying body; a literalisation of the premise that no amount of evolution, philosophy, or esotericism can ever change the fact that we're biological organisms controlled by our sexual yearnings and impulse to procreate - desire will always trump the social contract; we can place as much artificial limitation on our carnality as we want, but ultimately, desire will betray us.

Like I say, very multiplex-friendly.

Deep space. On an unnamed ship marked only with the number #7, Monte (Pattinson) lives alone with his baby daughter Willow (Scarlett Lindsey). However, this wasn't always the case, and as the film begins, Monte is releasing the bodies of his deceased crewmates into the void of space. How this situation came to pass is revealed via an achronological flashback narrative structure. At an unspecified point in the future, scientists came to pin their hopes for a sustainable energy source on the ""Penrose Process"" - a theory developed by Sir Roger Penrose whereby energy could be extracted from the area close to a black hole. Manning their ships with death row inmates to whom they have guaranteed pardons, the scientists neglect to inform the crew that they won't be returning to Earth. On Ship #7 are four men - Monte, Tcherny (André Benjamin), Chandra (Lars Eidinger), and Ettore (Ewan Mitchell) - and four women - Boyse (Mia Goth), Nansen (Agata Buzek), Mink (Claire Tran), and Elektra (Gloria Obianyo). Whilst Chandra is the designated captain, the _de facto_ leader is Dr. Dibs (an ethereal Juliette Binoche oozing uninhibited sexuality from every pore), a criminal herself, who is using the journey to conduct biological experiments on the crew - each day the men give her sperm samples in return for sleeping pills, and she attempts to artificially inseminate the females. Monte, however, refuses to comply, arguing that his chastity gives him strength. His obstinacy, of course, fascinates Dibs, who determines to get a sample from him by any means necessary. Meanwhile, all sexual activity between the crew is prohibited, although they are free to use ""The Box"", a room designed to facilitate masturbation, which all but Monte visit on a daily basis. However, as time passes, the isolation, the dawning realisation that it's a suicide mission, the increasingly invasive activities of Dibs, their past criminal predilections, and their unquenchable libidos start to take over some of the crew, with deadly consequences.

_High Life_ was written in French by Denis and her regular writing partner Jean-Pol Fargeau in 2013, and translated into English by Geoff Cox. An early iteration of the script was written by Northern Irish novelist and poet Nick Laird (who is credited as ""Script consultant"") and his wife, the English novelist and essayist Zadie Smith (who is uncredited). Originally, Denis planned to cast Philip Seymour Hoffman as Monte and Patricia Arquette as Dibs, but she was unable to secure funding at the time. Prior to shooting in 2016, she, the film's cinematographer Yorick Le Saux, production designer François-Renaud Labarthe, visual consultant Ólafur Eliasson (who designed the film's unusual ""shoebox-shaped"" space-craft), and actors Pattinson and Binoche visited the European Space Agency Astronaut Centre in Cologne to look at the practicalities of deep space travel. Additionally, physicist and black-hole expert Aurélien Barrau worked on the picture as scientific consultant.

_High Life_ opens, very unexpectedly, with pseudo-Edenic shots of lush vegetation, before slowly revealing we're seeing a garden on a spaceship, surrounded by and subservient to technology. We then hear a baby crying on the intercom. This opening, mixing vegetation, technology, and biology signals both the film's tone and demonstrates the economy of Denis's visual language, telling us much of what we need to know about the upcoming film. In the film's press notes, Denis states,

> _I was dead set on having that garden. How can you keep up the hope of return if Earth isn't part of the voyage? That earth is their Earth, the only thing that reminds them that they are earthlings, men and women of the Earth._

Denis and Le Saux employ similarly precise storytelling tools in shooting everything on the spaceship on HD video, whereas the few scenes on Earth are shot on 16mm - this gives the space scenes a sleek polished sheen, whilst the Earth material looks grainy and gritty, more lived-in, setting up an instant visual contrast to mirror the thematic one. I'd also be remiss whilst discussing the film's aesthetics, if I didn't mention what will probably be the film's most famous scene - a very energetic visit by Dibs to The Box, with Binoche committing herself entirely to Dibs's masturbatory excess, as she makes full use of the ceiling-mounted stirrups and the metal dildo in the middle of the room. The scene is beautifully shot, bathed in a gloriously blue light that softens everything it touches, whilst Le Saux shoots Dibs entirely from behind, focusing on the contraction and expanding of the muscles in her back, as if a figure from a Sandro Botticelli painting has wandered into a room designed by H.R. Giger. Furthermore, the scene is edited by Guy Lecorne with the use of fades rather than hard cuts, giving a sense of contemplative peace which contrasts nicely with the energies of the character. And never has the human back looked so sensual and magnificent!

Thematically, rather unexpectedly, the film actually has a lot in common with Paul Schrader's _First Reformed_ (2017); both films deal with the looming end of existence; both examine the possibility of finding hope amidst the oncoming cataclysm; both see the human race as essentially not worth saving; both focus on a very spiritual character facing a crisis of faith - in _First Reformed_ that crisis concerns Fr. Toller's Catholicism, whereas in _High Life_ it's Monte's belief in the importance of self-discipline and chastity. Indeed, Denis shapes the narrative in such a way that, for the audience, the experience of life on #7 is not that different from the experience of life on Earth in the early 21st century - people hurtling towards oblivion, yet trying to maintain a semblance of humanity, even as they fail to understand the gravity of what they're facing. In this sense, the film could be argued to be about finding the strength to face extinction, or, in a less optimistic reading, it could be about the pointlessness of searching for the strength to face extinction, because such strength is of absolutely no value.

Of course, on a more prosaic level, the film is obsessed with bodily functions and sexuality, with Monte adopting a very conservative ideology by refusing to give Dibs his sperm and electing not to use The Box. Fluids are a recurring motif throughout, whether the blood that several characters shed, the sperm with which Dibs is obsessed, the oil that keeps the ship's systems running, the water that nourishes the garden and that keeps the crew alive, and copious unidentified liquids (I've no idea what it is that comes pouring out of The Box at one point). Speaking of fluid, perhaps the film's most haunting image is a shot of one character lactating; her body producing nourishment for a baby she can't feed, as Dibs has taken it from her, the milk running down her body going to waste. Interestingly enough, at the film's world premiere in Toronto, this scene sparked a considerable number of walkouts, almost every single one of which was male. Make of that what you will.

The subject of fluids is introduced from the onset. One of the first things we hear Monte saying is telling Willow that even if it is recycled, one should never eat one's own faeces or drink one's own urine, as such behaviour is ""taboo"". If we accept that the ship's garden is Eden, then Monte and Willow are our Adam and Eve. Of course, as we all know, what comes next in Genesis is temptation and desire, and things don't end too well for our ancestors. Thus Monte's emphasis on taboo in this opening scene becomes ironic given that later in the film, he will come face to face with an even more controversial taboo.

In terms of problems, obviously, the film will be far too abstruse for some. When Ridley Scott was hired to direct _Blade Runner_, he famously stated that he didn't want to make ""_an esoteric film_"". And then went on to make one of the most esoteric studio movies of all time. Denis obviously wholly intended for _High Life_ to be esoteric, and she is unconcerned with CGI spectacle or any of the tropes we've seen rehashed a million times in sci-fi movies. For some, however, the film will cross the line from esotericism to impenetrability. Of course, science fiction can and very often does deal with huge thematic and socio-political themes whilst maintaining its identity as popular entertainment; films as varied as Douglas Trumbull's _Silent Runner_ (1972), Danny Boyle's _Sunshine_ (2007), and Christopher Nolan's _Interstellar_ (2014) are big-budget special-effects-heavy genre blockbusters that ask all manner of existential questions, and do far more than give us empty billion-dollar spectacles more concerned with selling toys than saying something of note. Denis, however, is more reluctant to give up the secrets of her picture. And for those more used to films that openly reveal themselves without the audience having to put in much effort, _High Life_ will prove too abstract.

In this sense, Denis's litany of themes does come across as a little haphazard, as she jumps around fairly randomly from ecological issues to sexual proclivities to what makes us human to extinction to loneliness. This results in something of a thematic pile-up, which, by definition, can feel like a bit of a dead-end. I don't agree with people who say the film ""had no point"", but I can certainly see from where such criticism could arise, as Denis leaves several ideas relatively and frustratingly incomplete. Another issue is that the journey of #7 is never presented in any way urgently, meaning there's rarely tension, as life on ship moves along at its own lethargic pace. This might make for existential pondering, but it doesn't make for especially engaging drama. And I have to admit, at times my attention began to wander, with the pace becoming more of an endurance test than anything else.

Nevertheless, _High Life_ is a fascinating film, equal parts poetic and prosaic; reaching for infinity, but never lifting its feet from the soil. Looking at everything from paternity to incarceration to apocalypse to canines turning to cannibalism (don't ask), it fits right into her _oeuvre_, belying the mainstream impression given by the marketing. Although it recalls the clinical detachment of _2001_ and the psychological intensity of _Solyaris_, _High Life_ is very much its own animal. Asking highly relevant questions about humanity and our inability to recognise the oncoming extinction, the film offers a savage and somewhat pessimistic corrective to the idealism of films such as _Interstellar_ and Ridley Scott's _The Martian_ (2015). Positing that mankind is a monster driven by its desires isn't going to earn Denis legions of new fans, but for those of us who were already on board, there's much to be relished here.",2019-09-09T21:52:52.922Z,7.0,High Life,2018

9383,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I have been unusually lucky with my SyFy-channel movie watching lately. I had no idea what this movie was really but there was nothing else on last night and I also noticed that it was directed by Paul Verhoeven which have directed quite a few movies that I really liked so I decided to give it a try. As it turned out, this is another movie that is somewhat above the usual standard for movies given on SyFy.

It has a rating on 27% on Rotten Tomatoes which is just bullshit. But then, the so called “professional critics” used by the Rotten Tomatoes are dimwits who trash every movie that is not “intellectual” enough for their self-imagined refined tastes. I do not know why they continue to use these clowns for their official rating system instead of the real audience? On IMDb it holds a 5.6 out of 10 rating which is more realistic. I was hesitating between 7 and 6. In the end I gave it a 6 because, as I said in the title, it is a quite okay movie but not a fantastic one.

The story of the movie is a fairly standard one. Scientist experiments on himself, experiment goes wrong, scientist goes mad, hack hack, chop chop, scientist dies, happy ending for the remaining survivors. Thus the movie pretty much relies on its special effects which are indeed quite good. The various invisible effects, not to mention the scenes where Caine is partially visible due to smoke or water effects, are quite enjoyable to watch. 

Kevin Bacon is making quite a performance as a very disagreeable fanatic scientist. He is doing a remarkably good job of it even when he is covered by a latex mask which of course is quite a feat being deprived of any facial expressions. The rest of the cast was fairly standard Hollywood fare, that is, fairly bland.

On the whole I found the movie quite enjoyable. It was perhaps a bit slow at the beginning and Cain’s show of megalomaniacal attitudes was indeed becoming a bit tiresome after a while. As I said, his roles was a very disagreeable one. Once he became invisible things started to become more interesting although it took a wee time for things to speed up even then.

It was certainly not a wasted movie evening and the movie is worth at least 6 out of 10 stars.",2013-05-09T06:05:28.852Z,6.0,Hollow Man,2000
9383,John Chard,"It's amazing what you can do... when you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror any more.

It was the film that convinced director Paul Verhoeven to leave Hollywood and take a break from film making. His reasoning being that any Hollywood director could have made Hollow Man, a big effects led movie that made a lot of cash at the box office. It's this that is the main problem with the picture, it lacks some of the director's bite and satirical savagery, even the souped up sex (natural or deviant) that often comes with his productions. Yet devoid of expectations of a Verhoeven masterpiece, and the crushing realisation that it basically wastes its potential and plays out as a haunted house stalk movie - it's a good enough energetic popcorner.

It quickly becomes obvious that we are entering special effects extravaganza, the opening credits are dynamite, sci-fi sexy, then the opening gambit sequence literally grabs us - and a rodent - by the throat. From here on in we are treated to grade ""A"" effects and some genius ways of exposing ""the invisible"" Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) to us and the prey he soon comes to hunt. Unfortunately the whole cast performances are a much of a muchness, and playing a roll call of sci-fi stereotypes. All involved here have done much better work in their sleep, but they put the bums on theatre seats and ultimately this works as one of those movies designed to thrill and awe the senses - but sadly not the brain. 6.5/10",2015-07-01T20:58:50.931Z,6.5,Hollow Man,2000
9383,Gimly,"Some pretty impressive effects for the era, and a pretty cool (if not original) core concept, but what's most intriguing about _Hollow Man_ is the hero's journey, or more accurately, the absence of it. The inverse of it. I don't feel like it's fair to even say that it's a villain's journey. Assuredly, by the end of the movie, it is very clear who our villain is, but given that he starts out such a dick anyway, the intriguing thing is not so much that he necessarily changes, but the idea that his character is maybe just ""revealed"". To become the type of prick he always could have been, if only had the power to be so. The thing is, he starts this movie a pretty archetypal protagonist. His role is seen almost identically across any number of movies for decades before _Hollow Man_ was released, and one that we honestly still see today. And this archetype is almost always beloved! ""Sure he's a bit cheeky, but that's why he's such a great character"". It's very confronting to think about what this archetype is so close to being, and I think maybe that's kind of the point of this whole thing.

9383,Kamurai,"Great watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend.

This has a fantastic premise of what happens when humans discover a process to ""invisible-lize"" and ""visible-lize"" organic life forms.  For a 2000 movie, this has a high production value and probably state of the art computer effects in 2000, and for most of the movie they hold up, though they do struggle at points.  I honestly do think that it's an ""invisibility"" effect, is what helps it hold up.

This is a rather tricky premise, it's presented as a scientist turning himself invisible, but it's much closer to a ""Twilight Zone"" episode with a philosophical waxing of a Dr.'s god complex.  What would a human do when it has a distinct advantage / power over others.  And while that is super interesting, it tracks a little better if you just think of him as ""snapping"", but the movie fights you on this as it very quickly devolves to ""I could do [horrible thing], who's going to stop me."".  It parallels with the mad scientist trope of ""We can, but do we ask if we should?"".

Kevin Bacon nails the awful, irredeemable mad scientist, and Elisabeth Shue does a wonderful job of playing support to Bacon and a protagonist in her own right.  It is refreshingly different that the protagonist is the bad guy, or at least he's fluid, and it's almost two different perspectives blended together to make one story.

I'm a big fan ""inescapable terror"" type of thriller, and this is fantastic example of it, and I think other thriller / horror fans will enjoy this where the sci-fi types might not enjoy it as much, even though that's how this one is sort of advertised.

It was refreshing to have the ""Elder"" ruling-class/vampire-nation-lord/shadow-council thing dropped, since they were in both Blade and Blade II, and in both movies they were completely killed off, and ignored the existence of each other. Instead we have a group of happy-go-lucky vamps, who have one way or another made a mark in the world. You never find out how they managed to buy a skyscraper and a museum's worth of ancient art, but I'd imagine they had quite a lot of time to get their finances in order.

Anyway, deal is these vamps, right? Danica Talos (Posey ""Queen of the Indies"" Parker; Scream 3, A Mighty Wind), her brother Asher Talos (Callum Keith Rennie; Case 39, The X-Files: I Want To Believe), Jarko Grimwood (wrestler Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque), and their offsider vampires go to Syria in order to dig up the slumbering Dracula (Dominic Purcell; Straw Dogs, Blood Creek)... Or Drake... Or Dagon... They keep changing their mind. Anyway, after Dracula kills a bunch of them, he eventually agrees to join the team after he hears about the defender of humanity Blade (Wesley Snipes; New Jack City, Chaos) whom he believes may be a worthy adversary. Blade in turn gets together with the vampire hunting cell called ""Nightstalkers"", led by Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel; the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Cellular) and Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds; Waiting..., Buried) and together they continue the war for humankind.

With me so far? No? Well you should be, because this plot is about as run of the mill as they get. While I'm on that, it's worth pointing out that where Blade's saving grace was this awesome mythos and story, and totally failed at character-ing, Blade: Trinity had fantastically written characters, in a sort of non-event storyline. Where Blade II blended them, making it the best in the series. Trinity was okay, but it lacked a lot of the engaging elements from the previous two films.

I think in part this is because the film is meant to sort of cater to the cinema audience. After the success of Blade II, it's like they knew that people were going to go to the theatre for Trinity so they tailored the film accordingly. You know, just little things, cheesy lines come across in a way more badass way on the big screen. Montages can get tedious on the computer, but can often blow you away in theatres. Explosions and action and CG backflips always translate better in cinema than on DVD. Unfortunately, I own the DVD, not a cinema. Maybe the goddamn vampire pomeranian they threw in would've seemed less ridiculous if I'd seen Trinity when it came out in theatres, but I doubt it.

I'd like to bring up the issue of names. Not that people have unbelievably crazy names in these films, it's the' Super Hero genre after all, of course they've got stupid names! I love it! But the Blade series seems to be populated entirely by characters with the ""Saying Names"" fetish. It's all ""Hannibal King! Die"", ""Blade! There you are"", ""Whistler! Come save us."" ""Drake! It's him"" and gets pretty unbelievably dramatic rather swiftly.

It'll be interesting to see how Ryan Reynolds fairs. This Marvel film came out quite a while ago, since then he's played Wade Wilson in Origins: Wolverine, Green Lantern for DC Films, he was the protagonist in R.I.P.D. He's set to return to the X-Men universe for Deadpool. I suppose if Chris Evans can get away with playing The Human Torch in Fantastic 4 and Rise of the Silver Surfer then move on to playing Captain America in The First Avenger I don't see why Reynolds can't pull it off. Hannibal was great, Ryan Reynolds is great but I'd be fine to see this be the end of it all here.

Then, as luck would have it, he meets up with the ""Nightstalkers"", led by former vampire ""Hannibal King"" (Ryan Reynolds) and ""Abigail"" (Jessica Biel) who might just have developed a virus that could rid the world of vampires forever. To combat this threat, the vampires raise their king ""Drake"" (Dominic Purcell) and the battle lines are drawn in the ultimate fight for survival. Snipes is OK as a our leather-clad, mean, moody, hero but actually doesn't seem to feature so much - most of the action is driven by Reynolds who, whilst initially quite sarcastic and witty, rather overplays his hand and soon becomes just a bit too attitudinal; and Biel who appears to be on remote-control for much of her efforts. Purcell makes for quite a decent baddie, as does Parker Posey as ""Danica Talos"", though at times you do wonder if you should be shouting ""boo, hiss"" at the telly.

36648,r96sk,"<em>'Blade: Trinity'</em> makes for a weak finale to this trilogy. I actually wasn't overly bothered by it whilst watching, though with the end credits I was kinda left wondering what I had just seen - as in it is all quite forgettable. Wesley Snipes remains the star, albeit not as great as before.

The cast is the most fascinating aspect to this film. Jessica Biel, Dominic Purcell, Natasha Lyonne, Patton Oswalt, James Remar and even Triple H show up, and that's not even mentioning the obvious: Ryan Reynolds. A beta test of <em>'Deadpool'</em>, really. That style doesn't quite fit here.

This is also one of those movies that has tasty behind the scenes stuff to read about, who doesn't love that?! It does have the feel of a film that caused disagreement. At least Snipes & Reynolds reconciled for <em>'Deadpool & Wolverine'</em>, because that was cool - even for someone like me who had evidently not seen <em>'Blade'</em>.

I do hope we get that MCU reboot at some point in the future, if only because I reckon Mahershala Ali would kill it as lead; of course he wouldn't at all be able to replicate Snipes, but that's OK.

123553,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I have not read the books. Judging by the reviews from people who have read them that seems to be a good thing as most of them seem to complain that the movie is not a good representation of the books. Then, when looking at the book ratings at Goodreads there seems to be a rather large spread between reviews loving the book and reviews hating it.

If I had read the books I would expect them to sit on my young adult shelf in Goodreads. At least the movie is clearly for a teenage audience. Nevertheless it is quite entertaining as far as I am concerned. A bit silly and predictable at times but still entertaining. I would even call it a family movie although there where some scenes that might be a bit scary for the youngest ones in the family.

The story is yet another variant of the classical young girl or boy discovers that there are things that go bump in the night and also that she is part of those things. I have to say that I quite like those kind of stories.

As I wrote I found the movie quite entertaining but, although I cannot say that I have anything specific to complain, the movie never really lifts itself above the average crowd of entertaining movies. The special effects are ok but nothing more, the acting is average, the story is okay and so on. It was enjoyable 130 minutes and I never felt bored but I never went wow either.

58431,Frank Ochieng,"One thing is for certain: no one can accuse director Burr Steers’s off-kilter version of novelist Jane Austen’s lyrical literary landscape **Pride and Prejudice** as being deemed solely melancholy and manipulative. The challenge of presenting a sophisticated and sudsy exposition while incorporating the ghoulish gimmicky of zombies to elevate the surrealism and cynicism of the British-based costume drama is an ambitious taking to say the least. Thankfully, Steers delivers a halfway decent piercing period piece that accentuates both the elegance and eeriness of Austen’s blossomed universe of early 19th century English femininity dripping with refined defiance and desire. Hence, Steers’s somewhat choppy but inspired **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** provides an imaginative and slightly insane spin on the austere exuberance of Austen’s classic romancer highlighted with the butt-kicking antics of the bombastic Bennett sisters.

There is no doubt that movie and television audiences throughout the years have been subjected to the omnipresence of the Jane Austen Experience through countless interpretations of her treasured **Pride and Prejudice** artistic works. For the most part, the radiance of Pride and Prejudice has always maintained its ravishing romanticism in the various incarnations showcased. However, Steers looks to promote a bloody-thirsty blueprint and enhance the urgent sense of Austen’s femme fatale movement–in this case unite the Bennett brood and arm them with the alertness of sinister-made sisterhood. Instinctively, the premise for **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** gives off a bizarre but refreshing vibe when distributing its wacky brand of subversive feminine liberation.

Austen heroine Elizabeth Bennett has always been possessed in her personalized convictions especially when it came to love and stability. Nevertheless, **Zombies’** Liz (Lily James) has a mission in mind that does not necessarily involve finding that ideal suitor of choice. In this case, Elizabeth and her sisters Jane, Mary, Kitty and Lydia (Bella Heathcoate, Mille Brasy, Suki Waterhouse and Ellie Bamber) are the sisterly slayers trained to eradicate the unwanted walking dead. The Bennett beauties, all skilled at exceptional swordplay courtesy of intensified training in China, are looked down upon within their elite social circles. Furthermore, the concern over the feisty Elizabeth and her siblings finding their soulmates rests on the shoulders of their worrisome parents Mr. and Mrs. Bennett (Charles Dance and Sally Phillips). What is to become of the vast Bennett estate should their offspring not find the eligible companions to continue the bloodline? The question remains: will the bashing Bennett babes go down in family history as courageous zombie huntresses  or suffer the societal humiliation as available spinsters untouched?

Elizabeth’s preference is to be vigilant in her quest to zap out the zombie presence whenever possible as opposed to obsessing over whether she will hook the grand love of her life. Still, the very idea of meeting Colonel Darcy (Sam Riley) at one of the festive balls may have at least humbled the combative Elizabeth a bit and had her entertain the notion of embracing a romantic feeling. Unfortunately duty calls and the agenda for terminating the pesky zombies as they invade the region is the top priority for Bennett brigade.

Actually, **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a frenetic fable that solidly works because it is able to competently marry two ubiquitous genres–zombie B-movies with prim and proper Austen period piece adaptations–and come up with a quirky and contentious commentary on female-oriented resistance and rage. Steers rips into the convention of womanhood wonderment with a horror flick romancer that has its sheer of nuanced nerve and chilly-minded charm. The gory shenanigans and showy execution of Zombies’  cinematic makeup from Remy Adefarasin’s luscious cinematography to David Warren’s production design and Julian Day’s costume designs all mesh with noted symmetry. The balance of wit, suspense, terror and tirade as the Bennett bunch and their suitors engage in swagger as they eliminate the detestable zombies feels delectable in manufactured naughtiness.

The performances are steady and give substance to the welcomed wackiness that uncannily defines this effectively compelling but twisted treat to Austen’s pretty protagonists dressed up in gorgeous gowns that conceal their blood-laced daggers. As the lead Bennett sister, James is rather engrossing as the impulsive sword-swinging sass as her unique spin on Austen’s curly-haired creation is as credible and creative as say Keira Knightley’s stamp on the Elizabeth Bennett role.  Although rollicking in a zombie B-movie without relying too much on the crutch of high stakes camp, James and her supporting players are quite poised to go with the flow based on what the unpredictable material hands them.

The bottom line is that **Pride and Prejudice and Zombies** is a serviceable spectacle that dares to weave a Victorian-cultured social class romance yarn with an undead creepfest while finding a common ground in the hidden psyche of the young woman’s destined determination for self-discovery. Perhaps introducing the less literate crowd to Jane Austen’s brand of high class sensibilities through the battling Bennetts during the onslaught of an English countryside zombie invasion would make other future **Pride and Prejudice** installments feel more renewed and receptive.

I did not know there was a parody novel of Jane Austen's 200 years old classic. This was based on that, a multi-starrer film, but the lack of star value let down the film. This is the film with a familiar plot, in addition to that zombies were there, but that was not enough. The big names from the cast would have pulled the film out of the box office disaster if it had one or two. But still I think this film was okay, an acceptable with awesome production and performances.

It ended like there will be a sequel, but now I don't think there's going to be one. The story was kind of predictable. Well, I did predict, particularly the character Wickham. Though I was more curious about the Zombies, like how it was going to be used in the narration. I must say, they were excellent. I mean they were not given any big preference, but theirs part indeed helped to build a nice plot. Pretty well composed stunts. I mean carefully, without strong blood and gore, so they got PG13 and warning for the violences.

I think the film critics overreacted like usual. They're like the sheep herds, they follow one another and given verdict for this as a bad flick. But as a film fanatic, I don't think it is worth neglecting, especially if you are a fan of the original story. In the todays world, the critics are a bunch of circus clowns. So I hope you make a right choice on this, not because of me or the critics, if you haven't seen it yet.

I already had an idea that this movie was bad when I decided to see how bad it was. Unfortunately, the film is about as bad as it gets, cloyingly and terribly unhappy mixing up “Pride and Prejudice”, “Seven Samurai” and “Walking Dead”. There are no surprises here, the movie is what it says it is.

What would Jane Austen say? I think she would gladly eat the brains of Burr Steers and Seth Grahame Smith, if they were medically proven to have brains. After seeing this crappy movie, I personally have doubts about it. The movie tried to update or give us a different version of “Pride and Prejudice”… but instead it spit in Jane Austen's face full force. If I were the author, I would take this film as an insult. It's just stupid, idiotic, unintelligent and brutally crazy.

It's one of those movies where, quite simply, nothing works. There is no saving material here, no redeeming qualities. Scenery, costumes? Forget it… it was all a masquerade. CGI, action scenes? It looks like a video game without life or soul, with fight scenes choreographed to the millimeter, like a theater ballet. The actors? All the characters were meticulously run over by a script that should have been burned in the fireplace. If I were an actor, I would not have accepted to work in this film.

627290,SWITCH.,"As someone who has been enjoying the renewed focus on black horror and the rise in storytelling from unique perspectives kickstarted by 'Get Out', it makes my heart sink to see something like 'Antebellum' stumble into cinemas. My fear is that if there are enough negative appraisals of the genre and the discourse shrinks, the film industry will just stop producing socially conscious horror movies, point-blank. The biggest sin that 'Antebellum' commits is that the filmmakers took one of the most horrific periods of American history and, via exceedingly clumsy execution, unintentionally made it into a joke.

627290,Manuel São Bento,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @
https://www.msbreviews.com

Some media outlets are providing a spoiler-ish synopsis that I believe the film should have omitted throughout its marketing campaign, including its own trailers. There's a central mystery that only begins almost midway through the runtime, and it plays out until the start of the third act, so you have my advice: stay away from its trailers and don't read too many synopses. Since I didn't know anything about it, I watched Antebellum with modest expectations, and most important of all, without any preconceived ideas or theories about its narrative structure. 

However, I couldn't help but see the movie later than most people, and I have to admit: I'm slightly surprised that so many people deeply hate this film… It does have some issues, and I'll get to those, but overall, I believe the extreme White-on-Black violence is the main reason why so many viewers gave up on the movie. I'll start with this topic. It's indisputable that Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz (feature directorial debuts) deliver quite a shocking film, depicting racism and slavery in unpleasant yet realistic ways. This last part is precisely the seamless balance that every movie needs to have when dealing with these themes, and in my opinion, Bush and Renz didn't really nail it.

The brutal torture and death sequences that Black people suffer in this film are shown without any restraint. From massive amounts of blood to visible hits, it's one of those movies that carries so much realism that it becomes uncomfortable. If these scenes end up carrying a meaningful message or a compelling arc, it might be hard to watch, but it ultimately feels necessary and emotionally impactful. If they don't, then it just looks like violence for the sake of entertainment, which will always bother a lot of viewers depending on the type of violence on display. Bush and Renz risk the film's success walking this thin line, and overall, even though they're far from perfecting that balance, they didn't do a bad job, at all.

In fact, for a directorial debut, Antebellum is technically remarkable. Opening with an uncut, long opening sequence, where the camera shows the entire plantation, passing through the recent arrival of Janelle Monáe's character, and finishing in a horrendous slow-motion treatment of a desperate slave trying to escape. These six to eight minutes function like a disclaimer to the audience. If people feel way too disturbed by what they've just witnessed, then it's better to leave this one on the side, and forget about it. 

Pedro Luque's cinematography feels definitely unique, and it never shies away from displaying what's happening, no matter how gruesome and terrible. The musical score from Nate Wonder and Roman Gianarthur, characterized by its dominant use of strings, elevates so many suspenseful moments. Honestly, it's pretty addictive to listen to. Great production value, as expected, costume and set design are fantastic… visually, I find nothing to complain about. Even judging the brutality solely on itself, if the purpose is to demonstrate how much slaves suffered back then, it's as faithful as it could be.

Story-wise, Bush and Renz need to improve their quality as screenwriters. Their premise is extremely convincing, the nonlinear narrative structure adds a neat mystery, and the story itself is incredibly intriguing. However, instead of reaching its undeniable potential and delivering a phenomenal, profound, well-developed screenplay, Antebellum ends up in a predictable manner, leaving tons of interesting storylines to explore. Even its climactic, action-heavy final minutes are underwhelming, and every problem is solved way too easily. It even gives the viewer the right to question why and how everything that happens in the movie could, in fact, occur for so long.

Nevertheless, it's far from being a trainwreck, much on the contrary. I was invested until the very end, almost every scene is captivating to the point of me staying completely still without taking my eyes off the screen. I didn't feel too uncomfortable with the display of violence, so my experience was smoother than most people, I'd assume. The excellent representation of Janelle Monáe's character's distinct lifestyles, in the plantation and in the city, is the best aspect of the entire film, clearly setting up a different color palette and tone. Monáe offers a powerful performance, carrying the whole movie on her shoulders, as the sole protagonist of an incredibly heavy story.

All in all, Antebellum is set to divide viewers due to its uncomfortable yet realistic, extreme violence. Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz deliver an undeniably shocking film, involving hard-to-watch depictions of torture, slavery, and racism. Technically, the camera work gives the whole movie a distinct style, as well as its score, costumes, and set design. Janelle Monáe demonstrates her acting abilities as the protagonist, delivering an emotionally captivating display. The nonlinear narrative structure elevates the central mystery, but the story doesn't receive the extensive treatment that its premise deserves. The enormous potential is wasted in meaningless, horrific deaths, just as in the third act's disappointing action sequences. While the White-on-Black violence is justified in the context of the film, its excessive, unrestrained display without a convincing message or arc surrounding it is definitely a negative aspect that some people won't be able to accept. I didn't feel bothered to that level, and I still believe the intent was benign, so I recommend this directorial debut from Bush and Renz, but with a disclaimer for the sensitive subject matter and/or viewers who struggle with depictions of intense violence.

A monstrous croc is discovered to live in a remote lake in Maine and so a conflicting group of people join together to capture or kill it: the local Sheriff (Brendan Gleeson), a Fish and Game officer (Bill Pullman), a paleontologist (Bridget Fonda) and an expert croc hunter (Oliver Platt). Betty White is on hand as a comical lady who lives on the lake.

“Lake Placid” (1999) is the best of the series due to the simple fact that it was the only theatrically released installment and cost $35 million, which is about 17.5 times as much as any of the five follow-ups, which had TV-budgets (for instance, “Lake Placid 2” only cost $2 million). With such a hefty budget for what is essentially a Grade B creature feature, the croc looks great compared to the cartoonish CGI of the sequels. The cast is pretty top-rate as well and the dialogue is witty, plus delivered smoothly (although you have to pay attention because it’s so rapid-fire).

Speaking of which, this can’t be taken as a serious creature-on-the-loose flick, like “Prophecy” (1979) or “Black Water” (2007) because it’s so funny in a droll way. Films like “Crocodile” (2000), “Humanoids from the Deep” (1980) and “Piranha” (1978/1995) are dead serious by comparison. If you can roll with it, however, it IS genuinely amusing and you start to buy into the reality of the characters and their situation. While their relationships are what psychologists would call conflict-habituated and the old lady cusses like a sailor, the movie has a warm heart, just stick around till the ending.

Of course Bridget stands out in the female department. She was 34 during shooting and would only do seven more movies (two of them TV productions) before leaving acting to focus on raising a family (she also worked on two TV series at this time).  While people complain about how annoying her character is in “Lake Placid,” it’s understandable if you consider what’s happening in her life in combination with being a fish-out-of-water camping out in the backwoods; besides, she becomes warmer as the story evolves.

Also on the feminine front are Meredith Salenger as Deputy Gare and Natassia Malthe as Janine, the latter in a bit part. Both are winsome and easy on the eyes.

I didn’t have very fond memories of this film due to the dry humor and conflicting personalities, but I ‘got’ it this time and really enjoyed it for what it is, an amusing creature feature supported by a huge theatrical budget. If you like this one, be sure to check out “Lake Placid 2” (2007) as it’s a worthy sequel, even though it only cost a fraction of the amount.

The film is short-and-sweet at 1 hour, 22 minutes. It was shot at Buntzen Lake, British Columbia, which is just northeast of Vancouver, as well as other lakes in the region (Shawnigan Lake & Hayward Lake), plus establishing shots of Camden, Maine, and opening shots of Manhattan.

Hell yeah! Crocodile vs. Bear! And Betty White is great in this, I love her RIP. The cinematography is a little below average I think. And overall the movie is average, I like that they picked crocodile as the monster, it's usually sharks or snakes or something not real.

Billing Lake Placid as a horror movie could not be more misleading. This movie is a goofy creature feature with hardly a scary moment. Instead, all the tension and fear are played up for hilarity and entertainment. I remember watching this as a young kid and laughing the entire time. Lake Placid is a delightful action comedy with a solid cast for being such a low-budget film. Lake Placid is an excellent entry in a long line of stupid creature films that are pure enjoyment if you disconnect your brain, grab some popcorn, and get ready to have fun.

7978,John Chard,"Extended Cut: Proving in fact that The Wolfman is no monstrosity.

The Wolfman is directed by Joe Johnston and adapted to screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self from Curt Siodmak's original 1941 screenplay. It stars Benicio del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and Shelly Johnson is the cinematographer. Plot is set in 1891 and finds Toro as Lawrence Talbot, who upon learning of his brother's grizzly murder, returns to his estranged father's estate in Blackmoor to investigate. Upon arriving he forms an instant bond with his dead sibling's fiancée, Gwen (Blunt), but soon Lawrence finds himself mired in a world of lycanthropy and family secrets.

It had a much publicised troubled production, with a director switch, numerous release date changes and enforced cuts to the running time, sitting atop of this particular iceberg. With that it mind, film is arguably better than it had any right to be. What is now readily available is an extended cut of the film where some 17 minutes of footage have been put back into the story. Footage cut originally to foolishly speed up the moment when the first transformation from man to wolfman arrives. Is the extended cut a far better movie than the trimmed theatrical version? The answer is resounding yes it is. It still contains flaws, but now the narrative is stronger and crucially by waiting much longer for the first ""big change scene"", tension and anticipation now exist where previously it didn't. 

In spite of some modern day advancements for this 21st Century wolfman - 
excessive speed for the wolf - creature smack down finale - Johnston's movie is very faithful and respectful of the 1941 original. Which is perhaps not surprising since the weight of Universal is backing this remake of one of their original classic monsters from the 30's and 40's. But it's nice to see that a remake keeps the things that made the original so beloved. Gothic texture is rich, none more so than with the mist/smog shrouded village, while the tortured sadness that permeated Lon Chaney's take on Larry Talbot back in 1941, is perfectly essayed by del Toro this time around. 

The creature design itself cleaves close to the original, with Rick Baker and Dave Elsey picking up the Academy Award for Best Makeup for their excellent efforts. Fans of shred and gore are also well served here, with Johnston (The Rocketeer/Jumanji) showing a keen eye for action construction. An attack at a Gypsy camp and a bloody rampage through a bus are the stand outs, while an asylum sequence is also not to be sniffed at. Chuck in the murder mystery element, and the intriguing father and son axis, and it's a film that has more to it than merely being a CGI popcorn piece. Even Elfman's score fits neatly into the period setting. 

Problem wise it comes down to Blunt and Weaving being under used, and Hopkins veering dangerously close to over hamming the omelette, yet all remain strong in characterisations. Toro, though, is not, as some have suggested, miscast. Already lupine like before transformation, he plays it perfectly troubled and brooding like. Talbot has inner demons and unanswered questions in his past, a past he has tried to shred but finds he now must confront those demons. The onset of lycanthropy serving, one feels, as a metaphor for his personal torment finally being unleashed. Toro nails it with an excellent and subdued portrayal, even if the choice of hair style leaves much to be desired. Worth a mention as well is Shelly Johnson's photography, where nice atmospheric visuals complement the tone and period flavour of the piece. 

More homage than outright horror, but with a little something for everyone interested in Horror/Gothic/Mystery type movies, The Wolfman in extended form is an enjoyable enough experience. 7/10",2020-10-04T23:06:56.565Z,7.0,The Wolfman,2010
10781,JPV852,"I saw this film when it first came out on DVD back in 2006 or 07 and didn't think much of it. And my opinion pretty much remains, some great and gnarly gore that rode the line from horror to torture porn, but R. Lee Ermey was greatly sadistic and, as with Jessica Biel in TCM '05, the camera focused pretty well on Jordana Brewster's ass. I thought this one didn't have any memorable characters to make me care about their plight and the ending was laughable at just how nimble and sneaky the bulky Leatherface was somehow hide in the backseat and let our potential Final Girl drive away only to chainsaw her from the backseat (reminds me on how Mrs. Vorhees was able to take a knife through Kevin Bacon's chest from underneath a bed).

I wanted to like this one and there are some things to admire with its gore effects and some very grim and dark humor, it's not a good movie but better than the subsequent outings that followed this (Texas Chainsaw 3D, Leatherface and Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022). **2.5/5**",2025-09-08T23:31:55.026Z,5.0,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning,2006

Now, can ""Gomez"" thwart this cunning plan before his family are actually reduced to sleeping in graves - for real? The casting, writing and direction from a top-of-his game Barry Sonnenfeld make for an entertaining spoof of all thing macabre whilst still extolling a semblance of family virtues and loyalty - told in real time and using some amiable flashbacks from when they were all ""younger"". The visual effects are understated and effective - especially regarding their loyal retainer that is the disembodies ""hand"" and the script allows Lloyd in particular, but all in general to deliver a dialogue that raises a smile without raising an eyebrow.

935,CRCulver,"Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film <i>Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove</i> is a hilarious film about the nuclear annihilation of the human race. Its plot combines three strands that lead inevitably to this doomsday. In the first, an Air Force base commander (Sterling Hayden) goes insane and launches the go-code for his B52s to drop the bomb on their targets in Russia, while a British captain on an officer exchange program (Peter Sellers) tries to reason with him. In the second strand, we see the crew of a B52 commanded by the cowboyish Major Kong (Slim Pickens) as they prepare to drop the bomb. Finally, there are the scenes from the Pentagon war room, where the American president (again Peter Sellers) harangues a general (George&nbsp;C. Scott) about how this could have happened, until the mysterious German scientist Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove (Peter Sellers yet again) offers a solution.

Originally meant to be a straightforward adaptation of a political thriller novel, <i>Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove</i> became a madcap comedy. The characters' sexual quirks, anti-Communist hysteria and nonchalance about the coming apocalypse and are exaggerated to the point of farce. No other Peter Sellers film shows off his range of talents so well: he segues effortlessly between Captain Mandrake, a nervous fellow with a British accident already antiquated at the time the film was made, the staid American politician President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove, one of the Nazi scientists that the USA brought over after World War&nbsp;II.

Filmgoers must have perceived this film somewhat differently, when the threat of nuclear annihilation felt very real. Contemporary audiences won't fully get how black this black comedy is. Nonetheless, this film remains perennially funny, and even after numerous viewings over the last 15 years or so I still laugh every time.",2018-09-08T04:21:31.205Z,9.0,Eli I,2019

Thanks to this eccentric comedy, I now have considerable respect for the talent of Peter Sellers.  How he pulled off three totally different roles so convincingly is just beyond me.  Especially his portrayal of the U.S. President; I could hardly believe that British Peter Sellers could do an American accent that naturally.  This was apparently a very black comedy for its time, as the threat of nuclear war was really a thing when this was filmed.  Offbeat, humorous script includes some eyebrow-raising, edgy dialogue and scenes.

935,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**Sex and war in an extremely sarcastic and intelligent film.**

This film is one of the best of director Stanley Kubrick's career, and is also one of the most iconic and acidic satire that cinema has ever seen. Inspired by a tense novel that was published in the same period, and by the political and military events that were taking place at the time, the film shoots in all directions to give us the most absurd and ridiculous image of the rivalry between the USA and the Soviet Union. Despite everything, and all the points in favor, I don't think this film is a true comedy. To me, honestly, it didn't make me laugh, although I absorb and understand the acidic irony that is here.

The script begins with a very serious incident that could be true (and the US even reviewed its military strategies in order to prevent something similar from happening in real life): after inventing, in his troubled mind, a crazy conspiracy theory according to which the Soviets are poisoning American drinking water, a crazed general initiates a pre-orchestrated military protocol designed to retaliate against a Russian attack with the full force of their nuclear arsenal. But with one detail: there was no Russian attack, which would make the Americans the aggressor country, and responsible for a holocaust of biblical proportions. Informed of this, the president meets with his generals and, in direct articulation with the Kremlin, tries by all means to prevent the worst.

What's extraordinary about this film is the way it ridicules the sexual arousal that several characters have around nuclear war. For these characters, the end of the world, total war, is an absolute fetish, portrayed in almost erotic detail. The most obvious cases are Generals Ripper and Turgidson: each, in his own way, vehemently expressing the mental connection they make between sex and war. Whether by the way they speak and express themselves, or more implicitly, by holding phallic elements that are increasingly evident, they are men who are horny in war. In the same line of thought, the commander of the American aircraft, who becomes a cowboy on horseback in the bomb, as if this were an extension of his male phallus. And what about the character of Strangelove? His name says it all! He is a Nazi scientist in the service of the Americans, and the way he tries to contain his excitement in anticipation of the end of the world is evident, for example, in the idea he suggests of a bunker where the survivors, handpicked (the Nazi idea of the eugenics is very present here), would spend their time having sex to save the human race.

This is one of the great films in the career of Peter Sellers, a British actor who is famous for comedy. I've seen several of his films, and I already know his ability to play more than one character in the same film. Here, he gives life to three of the main characters, always with the same quality and professionalism. He is so good that it was really difficult to recognize the actor. George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are also to be congratulated for the work they did in this film, which was certainly one of the ones that most immortalized them as actors.

The best technical aspect of the film is the cinematography. Kubrick used various techniques to convey his erotic-military message, such as the opening credits, where an in-flight refueling becomes a symbolic copulation. The camera framing was also thought out in detail, with strategically placed close-up scenes, some characters very well highlighted and others reduced to the smallest expression of themselves (the American president, who is portrayed as incompetent, like his army is able to control). The film is a true lesson in black-and-white cinematography. The sets and costumes are also excellent, and the attack on the air base is one of the best and most realistic combat scenes I've seen in a modern war film. The soundtrack, finally, is one of the most ironic there is, and it perfectly matches the tone of the film. Highlight, of course, for the opening and ending themes.",2022-12-19T20:41:05.549Z,10.0,Eli I,2019
935,CinemaSerf,"Just as ""Seven Days in May"" was hitting our screens, Stanley Kubrick used a superbly over-the-top effort from Sterling Hayden to depict a rogue general who has decided to use all the checks and balances in place to defend the United States to his own mischievous advantage and launch a pre-emptive bombing campaign on those pesky ""Ruskies"". It's only his perfectly moustachioed British executive officer ""Mandrake"" (Peter Sellers) who smells a rat, but he is on lockdown in their air force base that is, indeed, being besieged - but not by the ""Reds"". Meantime, the American President (also Sellers) is only just finding out that he's about to start a nuclear war and nobody knows quite how to top it - not even his chief of staff ""Turgidson"" (George C. Scott). A call to his opposite number in the Kremlin reveals that the Soviets haven't been letting the grass grow, and that they have their own shield - and one that's use would make the effects of the Hiroshima bomb look like a damp squib. With all this mistrust and mayhem abounding, is it going to be possible to avert the destruction of humanity? Sellers has multiple parts and carries them out effectively, but it's the support from Hayden, Scott and the gung-ho, yee-ha, merchant ""Maj. Kong"" (Slim Pickens) - in charge of the heavily laden bomber that is likely to stat the conflagration, that demonstrate really entertainingly not just the faults in the whole principle of a paranoia-driven command and control structure, but also of the flaws of human nature when it comes to increasing reliance on technology and automation. The calculating eponymous character, who could have come straight out of a ""Bond"" movie, also quite cleverly points to the provenance of so many of the scientists who supported the West's military programming whilst their historical loyalties were dubious at best. It's only ninety-odd minutes, but packs plenty to think and laugh about as the ridiculousness and seriousness of the scenario are presented satirically and potently, at a time when the cold war was warmer.",2024-06-01T06:47:18.968Z,7.0,Eli I,2019
84348,LastCaress1972,"V/H/S, 9/10. Gory, fun and inventive - if flawed - portmanteau horror pic shot in the cinéma vérité (Cloverfield, [REC], The Blair Witch Project) style.

Like all anthology pieces, some ideas work better than others but V/H/S is packed with good stuff, containing as it does six ""stories"" (including the wraparound segment that tenuously links them all), each directed by a different up-and-coming bright young thing in horror movies. The wraparound story is by far the worst, and bizarrely it wraps up second-to-last, but still: a bunch of petty-criminal ****ers, presently making small-but-quick bucks from a streaming porn site by attacking innocent women in the street and exposing their breasts for the camera (charming) are hired by a ""fan"" of the site to carry out a reasonably simple task: break into a house, sneak in, steal a specific VHS videotape (apparently they'll know it when they see it, though this is far from the case), and get out of there. What they find is a largely empty house save for a cellar area chock-full of tapes and one room containing an expired tenant sat in front of a bank of old TVs and video players. They randomly play through a few of the many tapes in order to try and ascertain what they're supposed to be nicking, and that's where the five anthology tales come in; they're what these bellends see on the videotapes.

The stories, then (I'll buzz through these, they're only twenty minutes or so long each, so too much info will be to give the story up):

1. Amateur Night - A trio of lads go out on the razzle armed with some cool camera-glasses, so one of the guys can happily film their evening's debauchery without anyone being any the wiser; superb if you're planning to get a couple of lasses back to your motel room for some gangbang action and film the results. They... well, they probably pick the wrong gal to bring back. I liked this one, despite my nagging fear (placed by this segment in tandem with the wraparound skit and even borne out further - though to a lesser degree - by the other segments) that there might be a nasty undercurrent of misogyny running through the movie. I guess though the simple truth is that when you put a bunch of young male twats in charge of filming ****, they end up venturing up the ""amateur porn"" route sooner rather than later.

2. Second Honeymoon - Directed by slow-burn specialist Ti West (The Innkeepers, the superb House of the Devil), and this one's typical of his canon. Nothing really happens beyond getting to know - and like - the nice couple doing the usual touristy thing around Arizona/Nevada. Then a girl knocks at their motel room door. Gore-free - almost incident-free - until the very end, this one was nonetheless one of the most effective segments.

3. Tuesday the 17th - In which four kids go into the woods. Where some murders happened once. Ahem. The segment initially most calling to mind The Blair Witch Project being as it is both found-footage style AND set in the woods, this was for me the least affecting of the ""watched videotape"" tales, not through a lack of ideas (well, let me clarify: it DOESN'T make a whole lot of sense, but I don't mind that at all in short-story form) but because the actors in this segment were the most ""actorly"", the least honest and realistic. IMO. That said, it moved along at a real lick, it's as gory as **** and the antagonist's ""appearances"" on the videotape are pretty cool.

4. The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger - Chronicling a sequence of Skype chats (hang on: this tale is being watched on a musty old VHS tape; who's converting their Skype chats to VHS? Ah well, no matter I suppose) between a guy working away and his girl, who is becoming convinced that she's either going crazy, or the house is haunted. Her arm's hurting her, as well... Yeah, this was a pretty good one. Not much in the jump stakes but it had a nice Tales of the Unexpected vibe going on, which is always welcome in these sorts of films.

5. 10/31/98 - Oh-so-simple tale, in which a bunch of guys - and in a refreshing change from the wraparound segment and Amateur Night, NOT a bunch of unlikeable dickheads - are on their way to a Halloween party, and go to the wrong house. Like, REALLY the wrong house. This may well be the best segment of the lot. Certainly the most cool-effects-laden. It was a great way to close out the movie.

Flaws - well, there's that aforementioned misogynistic streak running through the movie (most specifically the first 40 minutes or so). Also, although great ideas and buckets of grue abound and it was a blast to watch at the time, I'm afraid that lasting, visceral scares are thin on the ground, although I attribute that more to the nature of portmanteau films not having long enough per segment to develop real empathy or tension. But the worst flaw, by the proverbial ""country mile"", is that of all of the ""shaky-cam"" films I've ever seen, V/H/S is far and away the worst, most vomit-inducing exponent of that trait. Cloverfield didn't really pretend very well to be all that ""amateur"", [REC] elegantly addressed the problem by having their in-film cameraman be a professional television cameraman, with professional kit, and the Paranormal Activity franchise managed to sidestep the problem with the utility of tripods and fixed camera positions. So the worst I'd seen before this was probably The Blair Witch Project, way back when. But the cameras in V/H/S have been painstakingly made to look as amateur as possible, sadly to its detriment on several occasions. I found myself craning, squinting and frowning to see what the **** was happening a few times when I should have been freaking out at the events unfolding on-screen (somewhere).

Still, despite that: What V/H/S gets right, it gets VERY right (and it does so very often). If you likes your horrors, you need to give this one at least a look. Recommended.",2013-08-11T15:54:40.606Z,,V/H/S,2012
84348,John Chard,"Creeper Compendium.

The horror anthology has a chequered history, some are bad but saved by one great segment, others boast a couple of genuine creepers but are undone by one instalment so bad it tarnishes the film forever. And on it goes. V/H/S brings the format into the new age by unfolding its tales by wrapping around the latest craze of found footage.

Six indie directors have produced a picture that was well received at Sundance but has proved to be most divisive with critics and horror fans on internet forums. This will come as no surprise to anyone who knows their horror anthology onions. The usual problems are evident here, a couple of great stories are surrounded by mediocre ones, but at least there is something for everyone, with most bases covered, but that in itself is a problem, all horror fans have preferences, it's a big ask to expect a fan of stalk and slash to love a story about a winged harpy!

Then there is the issue of the found footage format, here recorded on actual VHS. Not everyone is a fan (myself for instance), and much of V/H/S is dizzying and often hard to follow, especially as regards the Tape 56/frame narrative story that cloaks the other five stories as a bunch of no-mark young crims burgle a grotty house and sift through the tapes. It's a format loved by many for its supposed realism factors, I don't get that myself, but for those people this really is up their trees!

Amateur Night (David Bruckner) and The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger (Joe Swanberg) are the standouts. The former is a cautionary tale of frat boys out for sex who get more than they bargained for when they take home the mysterious Lily, the latter an eerie tale unfolded via Skype communication as Emily appears to be a victim of a haunting whilst chatting to her doctor boyfriend.

However, if you ask another fan of the film what stories they feel standout, you may just get two different answers. So as with any other anthology horror, you roll the dice and take your chance, just don't expect genius in every story, for that is purely folly of expectation. 7/10",2015-11-02T02:52:16.770Z,7.0,V/H/S,2012

I actually didn't mind _V/H/S_ though, this was actually better than a loot of the found footage stuff I've seen, even if they do lean hard into the most annoying things about it, say for instance, video quality, which is (intentionally) abysmal.

377264,Frank Ochieng,"Following in your film-making father’s footsteps can be perceived either as a credible career choice or an inevitable curse. So the question is put forth to **Morgan** first-time director Luke Scott as he oversees this kinetic but overly familiar choppy and saggy sci-fi horror-thriller.  Of course Luke is the son of famed _Alien_ and _Blade Runner_ movie mastermind Ridley Scott–the co-producer of his offspring’s muddled and mediocre futuristic feature.

Sure, the young Scott incorporates some of the elder Scott’s cinematic flourishes but for the most part **Morgan** toys around with interesting philosophical concepts and perceptions but fails to make any of these adventurous ingredients gel with any lingering forethought beyond the identity of a probing and generic genetics-oriented melodrama.

Indeed, **Morgan** has its moments of energetic lapses but the tension is telegraphed from miles away. There is something superficial about the manufactured dilemma in **Morgan** that simply misses the mark in mustering any legitimate skepticism about artificial intelligent ingenues gone roguish. The continued genre of artificial human beings–male or female–seems like a fascinating fable to tap into the mind of humanistic arrogance and progression. With past showcases as Michael Crichton’s _Westworld_ or Steven Spielberg’s _A.I._ one can see the preoccupation with revisiting this film phenom topic especially in the age of millennium movie-making. Unfortunately, the arrival of the mediocre **Morgan** does not quite follow a glorious path in this cinematic tradition.

The center of attention in this lucrative experimentation of artificial life forms involves a “girl” named Morgan (Anya Taylor-Joy). The construction of Morgan is quite ambitious as she is composed of synthetic DNA while placed physically in the body of a wild-child acting teenager. Morgan has the mentality (and physicality) of 5-year old lab-grown specimen kid and we get to check out her so-called psychological malfunctioning when she aggressively attacks Dr. Kathy Grieff (Academy Award nominee Jennifer Jason Leigh, “The Hateful Eight”) in her claustrophobic room. When Morgan tragically stabs Dr. Grieff in the eyeball we are bluntly hit over the head with the brutal hinting that this little hoodie-wearing dangerous diva is a walking disastrous time-bomb waiting to happen among the opportunistic human lab technician capitalists that invented her caustic existence.

Enter Lee Weathers (Kate Mara). Corporate risk analyst consultant Lee is sent by her profitable employer to the remote testing lab where Morgan was conceived to obviously oversee their expensive investment in the artificially crafted feminine pet project that now is showing telling signs of defiance and disobedience. The uncontrollable Morgan is an unhinged handful to contain and the lab staff at the facility are scattering about to contain the selective damage done by her destructive hands. In general, the massive and deep-wooded compound that houses Morgan and the various doctors, lab techs, researchers and business associates that come in unison for the sake of human technological tampering is a sinister setting to say the least.

Morgan is downright deadly and not a techno-tart to tangle with at will. As Dr. Kathy continues to nurse her severe eye-related wounds inflicted by the haunting human-like honeybun with indescribable speed and strength the other facility caretakers realize that the brooding Morgan may in fact be too much to handle for the self-appointed brilliant scientific minds that gave her questionable life. Among the brainy bunch that are trying to lasso the unpredictable tiny terror is Morgan’s main creator in the Nervous Ned-like persona of geeky Dr. Simon Ziegler (Toby Jones). Dr. Lui Cheng (Michelle Yeoh from “Mechanic: Resurrection”) is not new to the controversial rodeo where humanoid experimentation is concerned (resulting in Lui’s former colleague’s tragic fates). Married doctors in Brenda and Darren Finch (Vinette Robinson and Chris Sullivan) hold some glossy parental fondness for the hostile teen-experiment-in-turmoil. Dr. Amy Menser (“Game of Thrones” star Rose Leslie) has eerily taken some head-scratching “fancy” to the youthful Morgan that goes beyond inappropriate means. Rounding out the colorful group that cater to the facility functioning (and Morgan’s every step of chaos) is Lee’s tour guide Ted (Michael Yare) and cooking guru Skip Vronsky (Boyd Holbrook).

**Morgan** has some tension-filled wallop that resonates occasionally but the draggy drama never quite stimulates to the point of presenting Taylor-Joy’s lab-table vixen as nothing more that a brutish brat with a temper. The thought of Taylor-Joy’s minor-aged monster being unleashed on an unsuspecting world must have looked intriguing on the creative drawing board. However, being a pesky thorn in the side of misguided scientific minds does not exactly spell tasty devastation on society as a whole. In fact, we find ourselves cheering for the maligned Morgan to knock off these myopic medical duds to get some guilty pleasure relief from this lethal but lumbering horror sideshow.

Owens’s labored script is never challenging enough to buy into the cynicism of the profitable propaganda involving artificial intelligence at the expense of human curiosities.** Morgan** routinely dips into the blank coldness of hollow despair with only Taylor-Joy’s random naughtiness as the reliant stimulant. Mara’s Lee Weathers is surprisingly effective as the truth-seeking corporate drone out to uncover the mysteries of Morgan and the pricey lab compound that needs to prove its usefulness to her inquiring organization. Paul Giamatti pops up as the only sensible soul diagnosing the unwound Morgan as a potential toxic teen to the world environment.

There is some slickness and saucy sentiments to the uneven **Morgan** but it channels nothing dynamically distinctive from other considerable fare that competently tapped into this theme with more profoundly in-depth pizzazz and promise. Morgan may be a super-powered enigma and the hard-nosed Lee Weathers wants this frenzied freak show deactivated and put out of her misery. This is rather funny because the true troubleshooters that need deactivation are the **Morgan**-made manipulators (both on screen and off screen) that should return to the lukewarm lab room.

377264,Reno,"**Knowing it's a research, the mistake is emotionally attached to the subject!**

A nicely made sci-fi-thriller, but the entire storyline was built on a very familiar plot. You can find it similarities with 'Splice', 'Uncanny' and 'Ex Machina', but I think overall not a bad attempt. I did not get impressed, so do most of the people who saw those films, especially the end scene. Though it is entertaining, particularly when it turns into an action mode.

The corporate that invested in a research sends an investigator named Lee after the project was met with a small accident. During an interview, the chaos unleashes and the lab started to fall apart. The survivours does not know who to trust, but decides to save their subject. What really follows after that will be totally unexpected and another twist before the final credits.

Knowing it's a research, the mistake is emotionally attached to the subject. That's what all the similar topic films reveal. Then what's the point of doing such test, being doctor, studied psychology. For a film plot, they wanted to use the human sentiments and errors. Otherwise, science does not really deal like what was shown in this film.

From a new director, with the decent actors, particularly Kate Mara's best in an action avatar. I liked the Anya in the film 'The Witch' and this is another good performance by her in the title role. Felt like it is a short film, because the pace was so good, even though the story was a one-liner. Minimal cast film and takes place in a remote place secret research lab. A film not for everyone, but not bad for once viewing.

10280,tmdb76622195,"Stephen King's novel, written under the name Richard Bachman, makes a successful transition to the screen. Billy (Robert John Burke) is a highly successful defense attorney, getting an acquittal for known mobster Richie (Joe Mantegna). He is trying to diet, topping the scales at three hundred pounds. One night while driving home, Heidi (Lucinda Jenney), Billy's wife, begins fooling around in the car with him while he is driving. In the throes of passion, Billy does not see an elderly gypsy woman crossing the street, runs over her, and kills her. The judge and police chief conspire to cover the crime up, and the death is ruled accidental. That does not sit well with the old woman's even older father, Lempke (Michael Constantine), who brushes Billy's cheek and whispers the title of the film. Soon, Billy is dropping three or four pounds a day. He seems to be disappearing before everyone's eyes, but concern sets in. He is eating twelve thousand calories a day, still losing weight, and now Heidi and his doctor (Sam Freed) are spending a little too much time together. Billy decides to track down the gypsies, especially after hearing and witnessing others in on the conspiracy were cursed as well, and he mistakenly enlists Richie to help him.

Greg Cannom's special effects make-up is phenomenal. He has won Oscars in the past, and he should have won again for this film. Burke is totally believable going from 300 to 124 pounds in the span of the story. It helps that Burke's performance is as flawless as his make-up. He does not let all that latex and rubber get in the way, and goes from sympathetic to slightly deranged rather well. Jenney is also good as Heidi, although her character is often relegated to the ""supportive wife"" routine. The first hour of the film is very suspenseful. Billy is chasing the gypsies, and the authorities are chasing him. However, the film's biggest flaw was also the novel's biggest flaw- letting the convenient mob friend Richie help get revenge on the gypsies. Mantegna is one of those great actors who never receives his just credit, but here his character is just a caricature of mob types Mantegna has played before especially on ""The Simpsons""- try listening to Mantegna and not hearing Fat Tony. Holland's direction keeps things fresh, he shockingly shot this on location in Maine instead of fleeing to Canada like most Hollywood films, but the screenplay feels rushed most of the time. I wonder if this would have made a more effective transition to mini-series form, something King has done before. I was surprised by ""Thinner.""  Considering what some film makers have done to King's work, it is a better adaptation when put in that context. Strongly anchored by believable make-up and gore effects, and a fantastic central performance, I recommend it.",2023-09-28T10:32:34.732Z,8.0,Thinner,1996
18781,John Chard,"The Connecticut Horror.

Supposedly grounded in truth, The Haunting in Connecticut is a decent little spooker, yet still a pic that has all the pitfalls of other notable films of its ilk. Plot for what it's worth has a family move into a new home, only to find that it has ghosts and ghoulies residing within. But why?

There's good strength in the family dynamic at work here, the eldest son has cancer and is undergoing treatment. Thus he becomes the conduit for the strange happenings, and this as his parents fight impending grief and personal worries. The scares toddle along effectively, atmosphere via camera work and sound effects is perfectly efficient, and the story has enough mystery about it to carry you through to the end.

Unfortunately there's a lot of daft stuff as well, I mean who in their right mind would sleep in a basement room and not force open an adjoining door to see what is in there? It's these ridiculous leaps of faith required that if you are not willing? Then they kill the movie for you. The ending also takes some believing, such is the rampant stench of Hollywood of it all.

Well performed in the main (Virginia Madsen solid as a rock/Elias Koteas shining in spite of being under used), this deserves to be rated above average. But ultimately it rings hollow at times and quickly runs out of scares in the last third. 6/10",2015-10-21T01:04:47.952Z,6.0,The Haunting in Connecticut,2009

35791,RalphRahal,"Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) is a movie built entirely around its 3D experience, and that is both its strength and its downfall. The story takes a slightly better direction than the previous sequels, benefiting from W.S. Anderson’s return as director, but it still lacks depth. The movie leans fully into action and spectacle, with a focus on flashy sequences rather than strong storytelling. Watching it in 3D, the visuals and effects shine, giving a level of immersion that helps mask the flaws, but in 2D, it loses much of its impact and starts to feel more like a video game cutscene than a cinematic experience.

The cinematography and editing are more controlled than in the last two films, making the action at least watchable without feeling overly chaotic. Slow motion is used heavily, almost excessively, but in the 3D format, it works as intended. The film’s standout moment is the chained hammer attack, which delivers one of the most memorable uses of 3D, making it a rare scene that actually evokes a reaction. While the direction is better, the script remains simplistic, offering just enough to move the story along without any real depth.

Milla Jovovich once again carries the film, keeping it entertaining with her presence and well-executed action sequences. The supporting cast is there, but nothing particularly stands out. The soundtrack keeps the industrial rock vibe going, fitting well with the movie’s style. Overall, Afterlife is all about the 3D spectacle. If watched in its intended format, it is an enjoyable action-packed ride. In 2D, however, the flaws are much harder to ignore, making it a much weaker film when stripped of its biggest selling point.",2025-02-03T10:50:11.785Z,5.0,Resident Evil: Afterlife,2010
4970,John Chard,"Time to wash away your sins.

Whilst hardly being a very good horror film, it's not exactly the stinker some would have you believe.

The problems with it are that it becomes overblown, after initially pulsing away as a very moody and atmospherically tight spooker, set to a superbly eerie asylum backdrop, it gets away from itself in the final third. The makers never quite grasp the concept of keeping the mystery aspects of the plot still cloaked in scary tints. Tech credits are dandy, though an impressive cast list are not asked to stretch themselves.

Halle Berry is the star of <em>'Gothika'</em>, but is also joined competently by Robert Downey Jr. and Penélope Cruz; though we don't see much of the latter, unfortunately. The execution of the premise comes out alright, though could've been better of course.

There's also a tonne of screaming, most of it unnecessary. As for scares, I can't say it produces in that regard to be honest. It's mainly just the cast that stick out, but I still like the vibe of the film even if it never had me feeling tense or anything close.

Thankfully they kept it relatively short at just 98 minutes, even just 10-15 additional minutes would've crippled my feelings towards it. As such, it's passable.",2020-10-20T02:44:34.784Z,7.0,Gothika,2003

11015,John Chard,"Pot's a misdemeanour. Decapitation seems a bit severe.

The Relic is directed by Peter Hyams (also cinematographer) and based on the best-selling novel written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. The film stars Tom Sizemore, Penelope Ann Miller, James Whitmore and Linda Hunt. The music score is composed by John Debney. 

The Museum of Natural History in Chicago takes delivery of some crates from South America. Sent by an employee, John Whitney, one of the crates appears to be just full of leaves. However, just as the museum prepares to launch a major exhibition, where all the city's top brass will be present, a security guard is horrifically killed. Can superstitious cop Lt. Vincent D'Agosta (Sizemore) and evolutionary biologist Dr. Margo Green (Miller) get to the bottom of the mystery before it's too late?

From the bunch of creature feature movies that surfaced in the 1990s, The Relic may not win prizes for originality of plotting, but it scores high for tension and gloopy fun. Though the decent budget is evident ($70,000,000), the film has all the old fashioned values to make a creature feature work. Rank and file staples come thick and fast; boo jump moments, characters refusing to accept the un-normal, silly kids, silly coppers, a potential hero and heroine, possible romance, some sci-fi babble, a curse, and of course the creature itself - a big hybrid of god knows what! with the ""Kothoga"" being a snarling, slimy monstrosity that goes about the museum lopping heads off some inept human beings with carefree abandon. What's not to like there?

Though Hyams is no genius director, he is, as his CV suggests, more than capable at crafting a polished movie. Such is the case here, where the ""B"" movie story is given good technical treatment. The lighting (you may have to adjust your settings here) and editing serve the atmosphere well, while the sound work is of the required horror requisitional standard. More importantly, though, Hyams is aware of building up the tension by not unleashing the creature far too soon. We know it's the killer, and we get little snippets of it here and there, but it's not until all hell breaks loose at the big museum event that we get to see the monster, and it's not a let down. Part animatronic/part computer effect, the ""Kothoga"" is original and it is scarily great fun. So much so it (thankfully) steers the viewers away from the pedestrian performances of the cast. Not bad exactly, but just doing grizzled and spunky beauty (Sizemore & Miller respectively) doesn't really grab the attention. The best actor on show is Whitmore (tracing a lovely creature feature line from Them! in 1954 to here), but he is badly under written and under used.

Still, the minor acting issues matters not, for this is ready made for a Saturday night in with the beer and some snacks, so give it a go and you may just enjoy yourself. 7/10",2019-07-16T08:21:31.176Z,7.0,The Relic,1997

It's all pretty derivative, this, with a mediocre cast delivering a story that's as old as the hills. The visual effects towards the end liven it up a little, but not enough to prevent this from misfiring on just about every front.

12110,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**Nielsen has done better, but this movie is good enough to be enjoyable and mildly funny.**

This comedy, starring Leslie Nielsen and intelligently directed by Mel Brooks, is truly good. It is a parody of old horror movies, in which Dracula is an aristocratic undead who lives off the blood of unsuspecting humans. The film is more directly inspired by the old productions of Hammer Studios and Francis Ford Coppola's _Dracula_, which was still recent when the film was released. The script is, therefore, similar in every way to the last film I mentioned.

Nielsen is perfectly capable of putting up with the film effortlessly, with a generous dose of good humor, charisma and spirit. The actor is a veteran of cinema comedies and satire, we've seen him before in very funny films, and the actor does well here again. However, I can agree with those who say that the actor has done better works. In addition to directing, Brooks gives life to Van Helsing and is also resourceful and witty, with a relatively flawless work, but also without major merits. Much better than Brooks was Peter MacNicol's excellent performance in the role of Renfield. The actor is good, and he seems genuinely deranged. Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony do what they can, but they're not particularly happy, because their characters don't really matter here.

Being a film that takes place in the Victorian England, it is possible that Brooks gave the cast instructions to try to Britishize their accents. However, such an effort rarely resulted in any happy results, not to mention the jokes, who didn't always work well, with several scenes sounding overly serious or dull. The sets, as well as the costumes, are good enough, and I didn't find any major problems with the question of the historical period. The regular cinematography, the satisfying but not brilliant editing and the relatively lukewarm soundtrack complete the production values ​​of the film, which is far from being really good, but it turned out to be interesting, funny and good enough for us to bear watching it again.",2022-08-14T01:07:53.616Z,7.0,Dracula: Dead and Loving It,1995
12110,Wuchak,"**_Amusing parody of Dracula with Leslie Nielsen, Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman_**

“Dracula: Dead and Loving It” (1995) is a Mel Brooks spoof of the Dracula story with the same fun style and goofy humor of “Young Frankenstein” (1974) and “Spaceballs” (1987). Unlike ""Love at First Bite"" (1979) with George Hamilton, the story doesn’t take place in the modern day, but is basically a silly redo of the first half of “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (1992) along with bits from other Dracula flicks.

With Nielsen as the protagonist, you can’t help but think of The Naked Gun movies. Meanwhile Steven Weber is effective as Harker and Peter MacNicol hams it up as Renfield.

The presence of the stunning Amy Yasbeck brings to mind Brooks’ previous film, “Robin Hood: Men in Tights” (1993. Along with Amy, Lysette Anthony is a highlight in the feminine department as Lucy. Too bad her part wasn’t bigger (but it’s big enough, I reckon).

It's 20 years since Michael Myers Haddonfield, and in particular Laurie Srode, his sister. Laurie faked her death and is now a divorced mom with a teenage son. Michael is on his way to finish the job he couldn't finish two decades ago.

A true and honest Halloween/Michael Myers film this one, there's the distinct feeling that the people behind the series wanted to show that they remember what made the series popular in the first place. It's still the stalk and slash formula of course, but Jamie Lee Curtis returns and her character is nicely written. She's obviously still haunted by events passed and needs a stiff few drinks from time to time to keep the edge off. Yet she's in charge of a private school and is a stern but adoring mother to her son (Josh Hartnett). And she has a boyfriend (Adam Arkin) who cares for her.

The first half of film sets up Laurie's new world, while we jump back and forth observing Michael on his journey to final destination. Once the second half revs up, it's the scare time as Laurie's son and his friends come under great peril, which we know will lead to a final confrontation with Laurie. The kills strike hard, the suspense is ramped up, and then it's a frenetic action based finale capped off by a coup de grace of some distinction. All in all it's just a very good and proper Halloween/Myers movie.

Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is living in Northern California under an assumed name as a dean of a remote private school. It’s Halloween season and her son (Josh Hartnett) is turning 17. Will her evil brother show-up to wreak terror once again? Of course he will. Adam Arkin, LL Cool J and Janet Leigh have side roles.

“Halloween 4” (1988) was great and IMHO even better than the original 1978 slasher while “Halloween 5” (1989) was good, although it added a little campy humor. The next film, “Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995), was surprisingly a mess with weak characters, lousy story development and stale & pedestrian jump scares. So I didn’t know what to expect with 1998’s “Halloween H2O: 20 Years Later.”

The movie starts in Illinois with a glimmer of humor and the final scene of the character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt made me bust out laughing. From there, the tone turns dramatic as events switch to the posh boarding school in California. The characters are confidently established and we feel we know them as Michael Myers stages his assault.

I’m glad the creators decided to finally switch the setting from Haddonfield, Illinois, to a wholly different locale across the country. Haddonfield was getting tired. The plot is similar to “I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,” which was released a few months later. “H2O” is arguably the second best sequel in the series after 4 and is at least on par with 5.

It’s great to have Jamie Lee as the ‘final girl’ again. Michelle Williams also appears on the female front. She was only 17 during shooting and cute as can be. The attractive Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is also on hand.

After Halloween III veered in a new direction without Michael Myers, the indestructible killing machine of the franchise, the rights to the series changed hands and so it came to pass that part 4 (though part 3 in essence) brought Myers back. After being in a coma for ten years Myers is up for a transfer to a sanitarium, but wouldn't you know it, he wakes up and upon hearing he has a niece back in Haddonfield, he sets off on a murderous rampage back to where it all began.

It's one of the Halloween sequels that causes much debate among the series' fans, there are those who decry its lack of blood and its ordinary screenplay (both viable complaints), and those such as myself who like that it reverts back to what made the series start so brilliantly. Including a superbly devilish nod to the start of the 78 film.

Haddonfield becomes a town under siege, this the work of one monster, or as Donald Pleasence's scar faced doctor says - ""evil on two legs"". Myers once again is just glimpsed here and there, adding that unearthly suspense factor, until he hones in on his niece and her foster sister and the pursuit begins. Some of the interim characterisations are padding out the run time, the usual teen angst romantic flannel, but Pleasence's determined Dr. Loomis is never far away to remind us that everyone is doomed! Then of course there's the ending, which is an absolute beaut.

There's no brains on offer here, but it's a worthy sequel and a good tracer line for its iconic bogeyman. The story has moved on to another level and leaves the fans hankering for more. 7/10",2015-10-21T20:57:21.111Z,7.0,Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers,1988

11357,Wuchak,"Better than the original; and one of the best 80’s slashers

Ten years after the events of “Halloween” and “Halloween II” (which both took place on Halloween night, 1978), Michael Myers escapes captivity a second time and again returns to his hometown in Illinois with a direly concerned Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) hot on his trail. Myers goes after his sister’s daughter, Jamie, and is willing to take down the whole town of Haddonfield if necessary.

“Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers” (1988) ranks with the best 80’s slasher flicks and is actually superior to the somewhat overrated progenitor of the genre, “Halloween” (1978). Whereas the original “Halloween” was an effective low-key but classy slasher and deserves credit for starting the craze, it wasn’t without flaws and “Halloween 4” (1.) fixes those issues and (2.) improves upon its strengths.

For instance, while the original movie takes place during Halloween in Illinois, you certainly wouldn’t know this by the footage since it clearly looks like summer. This movie, by contrast, definitely looks like it takes place during the fall and has an all-around superior Halloween ambiance with trick-or-treaters and so forth. Another example is the original’s lack of drive and the fact that Michael only kills a few teenagers and doesn’t seem all that formidable whilst this film features a mounting build-up of suspense and potently conveys Michael’s deadly formidableness while upping the ante in the body count.

Other advances includes the lack of lame dialogue (like in the original when the girls were walking home) and Dr. Loomis has much more interesting things to do than lurk in the bushes by the Myer’s dilapidated abode speaking ridiculously ominous words. When Loomis speaks portentously in this entry there’s great reason to believe him (take, for instance, what happens to the Police Station).

Yet another (arguable) improvement is the women: Although Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Kyes (Loomis) and PJ Soles were fine in the original, “Halloween 4” has winsome Ellie Cornell as Rachel and hottie Kathleen Kinmont as Kelly and the movie wisely takes advantage of their presence in a classy way. Rachel may not strike you as anything special at first, but as the story progresses she emerges as an attractive and noble final girl.

The “Friday the 13th” franchise debuted two years after “Halloween” in 1980; and by October, 1988, when this film was released, the “Friday” franchise had no less than seven films under its belt. Meanwhile, “Halloween 4” was only the third Michael Myers movie (keeping in mind that “Halloween 3” was curiously disconnected from the Michael Myers mythos).

“Friday the 13th” of course ripped-off “Halloween,” but simultaneously added original components to the genre (e.g. summer camp and everything revolving around it, easily the best females in the slasher genre, as well as an increasingly devolving supernatural killing machine). “Halloween 4” sort of gets its revenge by borrowing from the “Friday” films; for instance, the character of Jamie Lloyd and what happens to her mirrors Tommy Jarvis’ story arc from 3-4 years earlier. Perhaps the greatest revenge is that “Halloween 4” is better than any of the “Friday” sequels after “Part 2” and is at least as effective as “Part 2.”

The original “Halloween” was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena & Hollywood) while this one was filmed in the Salt Lake City, Utah, region. Like the first film, it’s streamlined and doesn’t overstay its welcome.

3603,John Chard,"Ovinaphobia in Wairarapa!

Black Sheep, written and directed by Jonathan King is a wonderfully kooky horror comedy filmed out of New Zealand. Premise is simple, genetic tampering by unstable farmer man-child type has produced psychotic zombie sheep who like to chow down on human flesh. If you are ""lucky"" to still be alive after being bitten, you turn into a human/sheep hybrid - who likes to chow down on human flesh! All inhabitants of this island are doomed unless three spunky young heroes in waiting can overcome monumental odds and save the day!

With effects done by Weta being no bad thing, Black Sheep is a whole bunch of popcorn munching fun. Many of the jokes aren't really surprising but they hit the mark because the comedy is drawn nice and broad. It helps as well that much of it carries a sense of mischievous depravity about it, while the snarky asides to scientists and tree hugging environmentalists shows King to have a semblance of world awareness about him. The cinematography (Richard Bluck) is gorgeous, capturing the magnificent landscapes as a backdrop to the ovine carnage, and Victoria Kelly's musical score is jovial supreme.

Nothing earth shattering here, so those horror/comedy fans who venture in for the first time expecting otherwise will be disappointed. However, at under 90 minutes in length King's movie never once sags in pace or gasp for new comedic air. It's a short sharp shocker of a rib tickler and well worthy of a look if in the requisite mood. 7/10",2014-04-16T13:41:50.010Z,7.0,Black Sheep,2006

This one was better than the second, and I enjoyed it more than the first one. The atmosphere of “Paranormal Activity 3” is similar to the first film, and the larger cast delivers respectable performances. The scares might not be as effective as they once were since the same formula is becoming stale, but a handful of fresh ideas were good enough to compensate for it. The plot isn't the franchise's strong suit, but we get a little more insight into the demon and how the demon became connected to the family in this instalment. Most of the connections between the films appear forced, and there is an overall sense of incoherence. Nonetheless, if you like the first two films, this one could be exactly up your alley; if not, it's probably better to avoid it, as it doesn't add much to the formula.

585216,RalphRahal,"Escape Room: Tournament of Champions ramps up the intensity from the first film with more elaborate puzzles and higher stakes, but it stumbles when it comes to logic and storytelling. The rooms are undeniably impressive, showcasing creative designs and traps that keep the tension high, but the movie leans too heavily on the spectacle, often at the expense of coherent decision-making and dialogue. There are moments where the characters’ actions feel forced, making you question their intelligence, which can pull you out of the experience. The pacing is relentless, but it doesn’t leave much room for deeper character connections or meaningful plot development.

While it’s fun and engaging in the moment, the movie struggles with its balance, offering a visually captivating experience but leaving you frustrated with its many plot holes and lack of resolution. It’s entertaining if you focus on the thrill of the escape rooms and don’t think too hard about the logic, but as a sequel, it feels more like a flashy setup for another installment rather than a solid continuation. Worth watching if you enjoyed the first, but don’t expect it to tie up loose ends or make much sense.",2025-01-18T21:19:43.423Z,4.0,Escape Room: Tournament of Champions,2021

The film opens with a recap of the original and dives deeper into Minos, introducing new characters who strengthen the plot despite limited exploration. The escape room challenges remain creative and tense, with characters playing more active roles and the pacing flowing smoothly.

The ending provides satisfying closure for the main characters and Minos, though without major twists. Acting and visual effects are strong, though minor inconsistencies exist, like unrealistic car scenes and laser trap behavior.

I can't be certain though, because I'd have to re-watch them all to make sure I'm not making a bad recommendation, and I'm not super keen on doing that seeing as this one and the one preceding it were both kinda... bad.

The mythology of _Insidious_ is something I am very interested in, and _The Last Key_ added it to it **somewhat**. But if this is the sort of quality we can expect from future instalments, then maybe we should never see the resolution of the same cliffhanger ending that they've given us for **the last three movies in a row**.

Happy to go through life with her handsome boyfriend worrying, with her friends, about what to wear at the senior's ball.

Next thing, she is in a graveyard in the dead of night demonstrating some neat ninja vampire-impaling skills as she learns that she is the object of the desires of arch-vampire ""Lothos"" (Rutger Hauer). Luckily for her, pixie-esque, hapless mechanic ""Pike"" (Luke Perry) is on hand to help her as this small town soon becomes little better than a farm for their new hungry visitors.

Swanson plays her part for all that it's worth; I certainly couldn't fault her enthusiasm and Perry was an handsome man and provides an extra degree of slightly comedic eye-candy in what is otherwise a throwaway television movie that is probably only ever going to be remembered for spawning the television series five years later. I didn't hate it, I have to say.

346672,Frank Ochieng,"Some things will never change within the tedious and surprisingly long-running sci-fi/horror saga **Underworld** film franchise. The vampires will still feature sharp fangs that can pierce a hardened leather sofa with one bite and the werewolves will be hairier than the local women’s wig shop. Of course the curvaceous heroine of this Gothic gumball machine of a flick–_Love & Friendship’s_ Kate Beckinsale–will predictably wear leather-clad attire that will cling to her shapely body tighter than a preschooler hanging on to his mother’s leg because he is scared to enter the classroom for the very first time. What also is expected not to change anytime soon is the sluggish intrigue, overblown supernatural creatures acting more obnoxious than your drunk Uncle Jake wearing a bra at the family cookout and Beckinsale’s womanly warrior Selene acting as the badass bloodsucking babe out to mediate the conflicting forces that persist. Yes folks…you heard correctly that this is the fifth installment of the **Underworld**  universe that sits there and makes its presence known with all the force and feisty relevance of unwanted luggage left at the airport.

First-time feature director Anna Foerster (from TV’s “Outlander”) takes a crack at instilling some frolicking freshness in the turgid, cheesy **Underworld: Blood Wars**–a banal B-movie confection that Dracula would refuse to acknowledge even if there was a free showing at the local blood bank. Relentlessly flat, unimaginative and woefully recycled, **Blood Wars** offers nothing inviting or challenging for its aforementioned fifth time around the block and should have resisted the need to go beyond its 2003 Len Wiseman-directed release nearly fourteen years ago. Nevertheless, the devoted fanboys gave battleground beauty Beckinsale a theatrical movie gig (along with the rising popularity of the vampires/werewolves craze in cinema) that has lasted for an impressive long time as inexplicable as that sounds. However, lasting power does not necessarily mean a hill of beans with the one-note notion of a former orphaned vampire gal transforming into a beastly butt-kicking wrecking ball as the fatal feuding between the Lycans (a.k.a. “lycanthrope” or werewolves) and vampires escalates to a new level of chaos. Sure, Selene is not exactly as convincingly clever or calculating as Aliens’ Ripley (then again who is, right?) but she certainly is cut out of the same generic cloth as _Resident Evil’s_ Alice (for which pre-dates the **Underworld** experience as well as offering a longer string of sequels).

Foerster assures that **Underworld: Blood Wars** wastes no time in getting to the punchy antics of its silly-minded action sequences–some mired in empty-headed fun while other takes are needlessly monotonous. Screenwriters Cory Goodman and Kyle Ward stock up on the fluffy cliches of this toothless tease of a frivolous fable as the thin plot flies every which way more than Beckinsale’s golden locks during a heated scuffle. Sophomoric dialogue, formulaic confrontations and the dullness of opposing fierce factions set aside **Blood Wars** does make reasonable usage of its lethal leather-wearing lass Selene/Beckinsale in eye-rolling combat and the CGI visuals are engaging when not looking choppy in some instances. The fact that Selene has to negotiate some compromise for either side does introduce some slight sense of tension amid the roguish warfare and Beckinsale sells this quite accordingly to a certain degree. However, **Blood Wars** will definitely serve as comfort junk food for those legions of followers that have familiarized themselves with Selene’s jolting journey as she maneuvers through the manic mess that involves her blood-thirsty species taking on the hellish hairballs that are the defiant Lycans.

For first-time **Underworld** viewers or the casual crowd they will witness an under-cooked, ridiculously trite terror tale of an actioner that is sure to leave **Blood Wars** as nothing more than a false sense of second-hand stimulation. A generic exercise in the making, Foerster’s brooding bombshell in Beckinsale’s Selene is serviceable for a fifth go-around but that is really not saying too much given that the material never seems to revolve her from some of  her past misadventures through the four previous **Underworld** entries. The supporting players–such as Charles Dance’s elder vampire Thomas, Theo James’s David (the male Selene perhaps?), Lara Pulver’s Semira and Tobias Menzies’s Marius–are accomplished performers in their own right but they add little atmosphere to the hackneyed hedonism that toils within this supernatural stupor.

No need to put the stake through the heart of these returning vampires and werewolves because they have proven time in and time out over again that the sultry Selene and her creature feature bickering buddies are not budging anytime soon after almost fifteen years of conjuring up surreal nonsense. Kinda makes you consider putting a stake through your own chest, huh?

This series has been going on so long now that this movie almost comes across as a throwback, since it's still drenched in all the post-MATRIX visual cliches.

Beckinsale is as remarkably photogenic as ever, but the camera never lingers on her face for more than about two seconds. The running time is as tight as her costume, and it feels rushed.

As usual with these kind of movies it is one where you preferably switch of most higher brain functions before watching and just sit down and enjoy the show. The movie is certainly not a masterpiece when it comes to story and script. Actually the script is, at times, fairly crappy. There are for example a sequence were the Lycans are attacking the stronghold castle of the Vampires and the script writer taught it was a good idea to just let them drive straight into the center of the castle and breach the door before they got challenged. What the f…?

On the whole the script is a typical Hollywood B-movie concoction that holds little merit. If this would have been the first movie in the series I think there would never had been a series made at all.

So why did I like it then? Well, even if the script is nothing to write home about it is not a total disaster and it serves as an excuse to provide 90 minutes of good entertaining Vampire vs Lycan action. Plain and simple.

Of course Kate Beckinsale is a good reason for liking the movie as well. Her moving around in her intimidating (and good looking) skintight clothes slashing up Lycans in various creative ways makes up for some of the not so stellar script. I probably pissed of a bunch of feminists there but it is not really like a care about that.

The action and the CGI is reasonably well done and another reason to like the movie. Actually, come to think about it, Kate Beckinsale, the action and the CGI is pretty much the reasons I liked this movie.

They could have selected a more charismatic bad guy though. For most of the movie I felt Marcus was bland and even a bit dull.

It is not the best movie in the series but it does not exactly shame the series either. For me, I have to rate my enjoyment of it as above average compared to movies in general.",2017-06-30T09:06:32.938Z,8.0,Underworld: Blood Wars,2016

Like any guys from before the 90s, I was too a big fan of Beckinsale. There's no one can match her beauty, even to her age of today. That does not mean all her films are good. She has stopped doing good films a while ago. Every time when her films get released, I was hoping for her comeback like the old days, either a pure drama or an action film. No, not this film. It is what, the fifth in the franchise and the feature film debut for the directress of the television series.

As always, worth watching for Kate. The story continued, and it focused on the remaining vampires fighting for their survival against their arch-rival, Lycans. That's where the Selene caught between. But this time, it was about looking for her daughter, Eve, who holds the key to the future of these immortals. So the action begins where everybody clashes, racing towards their destination.

The first three were the good ones. This and the previous ones were downgraded the decent series. The makers are already working on the sixth. Definitely not expected, after seeing this particular film. But I hope it comes back to the original course with good story, actions, graphics and all. This was simply based on one liner, and the rest of the film leaned towards the stunt sequences. Okay to watch once, but I'm not sure worth of spending 90 minutes for it. So if you want to, then it is good to keep update to follow when the time comes to try the next ones.

To be fair, it doesn't hang around and Anna Foerster doesn't let the black leather-clad Miss Beckinsale keep her feet on the ground for long (or very often) but that's really the snag. There isn't really much of a story and what there is is all gummed up by some really lacklustre efforts from pretty much all concerned. It misses the simple dynamic of the earlier iterations that featured a smaller, tighter cast with a much more entertaining and menacing story.

The Rental is Dave Franco’s debut as both director and screenwriter of a feature film. Making a successful horror movie was never an easy task, but I believe it’s even harder nowadays. This genre has evolved in so many ways by delving into distinct subgenres and helping new directors deliver brilliant horror stories. Of course, every year has dozens of awful horror films, and most of the “Worst Movies of the Year” lists possess more than one horror flick. However, I firmly defend horror is reaching audiences like never before, and I genuinely believe that it’s a matter of time until a Best Picture award goes to this genre.

So, is The Rental one of the better ones or not so much? Well, it’s as “okay” as it can be. I find it hard to heavily criticize a film that doesn’t really give me much to actually analyze. It’s a straightforward story with barely any complexity. Four characters with clear yet generic motivations. Their relationships and how they handle each romantic bond is surprisingly the most interesting aspect of the movie. Still, besides being somewhat predictable, it seems more captivating than what it truly is because one particular screenplay element fails to deliver a compelling narrative. 

The main (and honestly, only) horror component of the story is no more than a hollow attempt at creating a franchise. Now, there’s nothing wrong with teasing an overarching story in the first film of a saga, but if this tease plays the entire horror role, then the only feeling Franco is getting from the audience is disappointment. Viewers might look forward to jumpscares and creepy sequences, but if the questions the movie makes are left unanswered, chances are people will dislike the ambiguity.

I’d be interested in a sequel because this first film creates a really intriguing mystery that I’d love to see developed and eventually solved. However, this comes at the cost of sacrificing the latter flick since it basically uses the whole runtime to introduce the overarching character/element. The Rental follows the usual “friends in a vacation house where things are not what they seem” formula, which doesn’t really set up Franco as a horror director to follow closely. He shows a bit of skill, the uneasy atmosphere is well-established, and he lets the actors play off their dialogues without too many cuts, something I deeply enjoy.

Technically, it’s quite good, to be honest. It’s a very dark movie, but I could see everything clearly, which is usually a problem in this type of horror film. The third act might be partially a letdown, but its execution holds the necessary tension and suspense. Dan Stevens and Sheila Vand deliver two great performances, showing remarkable chemistry. Alison Brie and Jeremy Allen White are also good, but the previous duo steals the spotlight. I wish it had more horror-like sequences, even though I appreciate the focus on the character’s relationships and dynamics.

All in all, The Rental is a clear attempt at creating a new horror franchise, and honestly, it partially works. If “success” means getting the viewers interested in a sequel, then mission accomplished. However, sacrificing the first movie of a possible saga to just introduce its main horror element doesn’t quite work as Dave Franco might have thought. In his directorial debut, Franco focuses on the characters and their relationships, which are undoubtedly the most captivating aspects of the film, also thanks to a fantastic cast. Despite some neat technical attributes, the formulaic screenplay and its predictable developments are far from being entertaining enough to hold my attention. The dozens of unanswered questions definitely leave an open door to produce a genuinely compelling sequel, but this first installment will always feel more like a prologue than an actual movie. If you’re just looking for a simple horror flick to spend your extra time, this one won’t surprise you, but it might be a good, inoffensive Saturday night pick.

Charlie, Michelle and Mina are successful professionals; Josh is dumber than a rock. How dumb is Josh? At one point he says he just got a ""weird text message"" and proceeds to play a voicemail. This must have been intentional; otherwise it's writers Joe Swanberg and Dave Franco (who also directs) who are dumb, and based on their movie they're anything but.

Brie is as effective here as she was in a very different role in Horse Girl, and Toby Huss, who plays the house owner's brother, and who is known mostly for his work in comedy (nerds like me will remember him as Artie, the world's strongest man, in The Adventures of Pete & Pete), is surprisingly chilling – although he isn't the 'monster;' he is actually a victim of real-life monsters: hipsters who knowingly bring pets to a rented house even though pets are not allowed; who play the 'race card' when things don't go their way; who are almost forty years of age but still drop acid; who have no control over their sexual urges; who believe that being able to beat the tar out of someone means they are in the right; and so on so forth. With the exceptions of Brie's and Huss's characters, it's hard to feel sorry for the people in the movie.

And now, as The Rock would say, here are the damn veggies. There is a not-very-mysterious mystery at the end of The Rental. The killer wears a mask, and even though he takes it off at some point, we never see his face; this doesn't really matter because his face wouldn't tell us anything we don't already know.

The Law of Economy of Characters says that no movie introduces a character unnecessarily, and a simple process of elimination pinpoints Huss's character's brother as the killer – what with him being the only living person with full access to the house and all. Now, since this character is mentioned but never seen, showing us his face at the end would be like, meh.

The reason I mention all this is because, in the final moments of The Rental, I couldn't shake the sinking feeling that even before the film was over its makers were already thinking about the inevitable sequel. All in good time, boys; all in good time.",2022-08-25T22:15:20.509Z,5.0,The Rental,2020

6466,Wuchak,"***Worthy new millennium entry in the Friday & Nightmare franchises, until they clash, that is***

To be expected, 2003's ""Freddy vs. Jason"" mixes together elements of the ""Nightmare"" and ""Friday"" franchises. Both franchises had essentially ran out of gas in the early 90s -- the last conventional ""Friday"" movie, before 2001's ""Jason X,"" came out a decade earlier and the last ""Nightmare"" movie almost as long. So mixing up the formats was a great way to introduce these modern monsters to a new generation as well as re-introduce them to the old.

THE PLOT: Freddy Krueger, the wicked spirit of a child molester/serial killer, is trapped in hell and unable to wreak havoc on the youths of Springwood, Ohio, because they have forgotten him and therefore no longer believe. Krueger's diabolical plan is to lure Jason from Crystal Lake, NJ, to Springwood and inspire him to go on a killing spree, which would naturally be blamed on Kruger, thus giving him the power to return.

Some say ""Freddy vs. Jason"" is more of a ""Nightmare"" film than a ""Friday"" film, and I can see why, but it's really an equal parts crossover. Once Jason is led to Springwood it essentially becomes a ""Nightmare"" movie with Jason as the antagonist until Freddy gains enough power; by that time the story switches to Crystal Lake for the finale and even provides an insightful flashback (via a dream sequence) of Jason's youth and abuse.

One of the highlights takes place early in the second act: Jason's flaming attack at a teen party in a cornfield; it's a dynamic sequence and features great opticals.

As with all the Friday films, ""FvJ"" features a nice assortment of women, beginning with the cameo of Heather (Odessa Munroe) in the opening reel. She's pretty much on par with the cameo of Agent Marcus (Julie Michaels) at the beginning of ""Jason Goes to Hell."" From there we have cutie Katharine Isabelle as a secondary protagonist and Monica Keena as the heroine. It took me about half the movie to warm up to Monica but she ultimately won me over.

""Freddy vs. Jason"" is a noticeably more technically sophisticated than the first nine ""Friday"" movies. Don't get me wrong, it's very cartoony and hardly scary (except for jump scares and gore), but it LOOKS so much better and has more oomph. The story’s also way more involved than the first eight entries and “Jason X,” which makes the film play better on repeat viewings.

The fight between the two monsters in the closing act is a cinematic tradition going back earlier than 1945's ""The Wolf Man vs. Dracula"" (aka ""House of Dracula""), but it's the weak point of the movie for me because it's just too cartoony. The film works as horror with either Jason or Freddy attacking the youths, but when they finally clash in the action-packed climax it's just too comic booky.

The film runs 97 minutes and was shot mostly in British Columbia, Canada (e.g. Buntzen Lake, Anmore), but also Toronto.

Some of the decent second tier horror and zombie movies were made in the 2015 and this is one of that. When the actors are in demand, we expect big from their movies, but this story suits for these actors. Because an average story looks better with guys are not in the watch-out list. So I was not surprised with the movie, but enjoyed the entertainment it offered.

Rainn Wilson's the man of the movie, but as for the narration Elijah Woods stands on the front. In this, the children were the antagonist, but it is an R rated movie and nothing was so serious to consider. You know bashing kids kind of stuffs were carefully crafted. Comedy means not like you're going to get the loud ones, but simply acceptable for a change in the storytelling.

If you exclude the zombie kids, the rest of the movie was nothing new. The same old adventure with the similar group of people who tries to survive the epidemic. Especially how it all begins was not logical, so you better not look for a proper explanation for those things. Even the runtime was well shorter than the 90 minutes that makes it sweet, Overall a fun movie, only if you accept what it delivers than what you want.

- Stephen King; _Pet Sematary_ (1983)

In Stephen King's celebrated (and massive) _oeuvre_, his 1983 novel _Pet Sematary_ (the misspelling is intentional) is something of a curio. Although reasonably well received at the time, critics have never considered it worthy of the kind of attention lavished on work such as _The Shining_ (1977), _The Stand_ (1978), _The Deadzone_ (1979), _The Dark Tower_ series (introduced in 1982), _It_ (1986), _Misery_ (1987), _The Green Mile_ (1996), or _Under the Dome_ (2009). Fans of King, however, have long championed it as one of his most emotionally devastating and philosophically complex works, whilst King himself considers it the scariest novel he's ever written. And although on the surface, the plot is as schlocky as they come, buried underneath is an examination of grief and how it can compromise one's ability to act rationally. Much as _The Shining_ was really about alcoholism and a descent into madness, _Pet Sematary_ is about emotional trauma, guilt, the importance of family, and the question of what happens after we die.

Written by Jeff Buhler (_The Midnight Meat Train_; _The Prodigy_), from an initial script by Matt Greenberg (_Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later_; _Reign of Fire_; _1408_), who's credited with ""screen story by"", and directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer (_Starry Eyes_), _Pet Sematary_ comes in the midst of something of a resurgence for the Stephen King adaptation industry. Recent adaptations include Nikolaj Arcel's risible _The Dark Tower_, Mike Flanagan's excellent _Gerald's Game_, Andy Muschietti's massively successful and massively overrated jump-scare-reliant _It: Chapter One_ (all 2017), with Flanagan's _Doctor Sleep_, Muschietti's _It: Chapter Two_, James Wan's _The Tommyknockers_, and Mike Barker's _The Talisman_ (amongst others) currently in production, whilst on the small screen, _Mr. Mercedes_ is entering its third season and _Castle Rock_ its second, with new versions of _The Stand_ and _The Dark Tower_ forthcoming. However, for me, much like _It: Chapter One_, _Pet Sematary_ doesn't really work. It's certainly better that Mary Lambert's 1989 filmic adaptation, for which King himself wrote the script, but it pales in comparison to the novel. Granted, most films suffer when compared to a source text; even Stanley Kubrick's _The Shining_ (1980), although a masterpiece as a standalone film, is a terrible adaptation of the novel. _Pet Sematary_, which relies far too heavily on jump scares, is especially disappointing in this sense insofar as it starts off very strongly, taking care to respectfully modernise the novel's themes and examine the characters' underlying emotions, before descending into absolute stupidity in the last act. King was fully on board with the film (he was fully on board with _The Dark Tower_ too), but Buhler changes numerous aspects of the story; some of these changes work very well, but many don't, with a new ending, in particular, substituting cheap shock for the lingering sense of psychological and esoteric hopelessness with which King's original so memorably concludes.

Louis Creed (the prolific Jason Clarke), a doctor from Boston, moves to the town of Ludlow, Maine with his wife Rachel (Amy Seimetz), their eight-year-old daughter Ellie (Jeté Laurence), three-year-old son Gage (Hugo and Lucas Lavoie), and Ellie's beloved cat, Church. In the woods surrounding their house, Ellie finds a pet cemetery but is cautioned against exploring further by their friendly neighbour, Jud Crandall (John Lithgow). Several weeks later, Louis and Jud find Church dead, and Jud, who has grown very close to Ellie and doesn't wish to see her suffer, takes Louis to an ancient Mi'kmaq burial ground behind the cemetery, instructing Louis to bury Church. The next day, Louis is stunned when Church returns home, although considerably more aggressive than before he died. Jud explains that anything buried in that place comes back to life, although very different from how it was, with local legend suggesting that returnees are possessed or controlled by some sort of malevolent spirit. A few days later, the Creed family suffers an unspeakable tragedy, and guessing what Louis plans to do, Jud tells him not to return to the burial ground. Louis, however, has no intention of heeding his warnings.

King's _Pet Sematary_ is a very loose retelling of W.W. Jacob's 1902 short story, ""The Monkey's Paw"" from _The Lady of the Barge_ anthology, in which a man is given three wishes, setting off a chain of events that results in the death and subsequent resurrection of his son. When the film version was first revealed, there was a lot of online grumbling about the big change from the original - it's Ellie and not Gage who is killed in the film, and whom Louis decides to bring back (if this was supposed to be a twist, someone forgot to tell the marketing people, because it's right there in the trailer). Speaking to _Flickering Myth_, Clarke defended the change, explaining,

> _it's pretty easy to justify. You can't play that movie with a three-year-old boy. You end up with a doll or some animated thing. So you're going to get a much deeper, richer story by swapping for a seven-year-old or nine-year-old girl. The reward will come. People who are upset will hopefully see the benefit of it. But a lot of people didn't have an issue. Stephen King didn't have an issue with it._

He makes a good point. Indeed, speaking to _EW_ the following month, King himself said,

> _it's something different. They did a good job. Boy, I saw all the stuff that came online when people realised that it was Ellie rather than Gage that got run over in the road, and I'm thinking like, ""Man, these people..."" It's so nuts. You can take Route 301 and go to Tampa, or you could take Route 17 and go to Tampa. But both times, you're gonna come out at Tampa! You know what I'm saying? It didn't change anything for me. I thought, ""Okay, I understand why they did it, because it's maybe easier to work with a zombie when she's a little girl than a toddler""._

Personally, I think the alteration actually improves the story - as in the novel, it's Ellie with whom Louis and Rachel have portentous conversations about what happens after we die, and having her be the one killed establishes a more coherent thematic through-line.

Speaking of themes, much like the novel, the film is primarily focused on grief. I've always loved King's ability to ""hide"" serious themes behind what are ostensibly rote horror stories (he's so good at hiding them that literary academics don't believe they're even there, refusing to afford him a place on the canon); in 2003, Yale University's Sterling Professor of Humanities Harold Bloom famously said,

> _the decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for ""distinguished contribution"" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis. The publishing industry has stooped terribly low to bestow on King a lifetime award that has previously gone to the novelists Saul Bellow and Philip Roth and to playwright Arthur Miller. By awarding it to King they recognise nothing but the commercial value of his books, which sell in the millions but do little more for humanity than keep the publishing world afloat. If this is going to be the criterion in the future, then perhaps next year the committee should give its award for distinguished contribution to Danielle Steel, and surely the Nobel Prize for literature should go to J.K. Rowling._

In 2014, he told the BBC, ""_Stephen King is beneath the notice of any serious reader who has experienced Proust, Joyce, Henry James, Faulkner and all the other masters of the novel_"".

And yes, _Pet Sematary_ does feature a sentient zombie child, so it's unlikely to ever achieve the status of the fiction of, say, Virginia Woolf, but its core is the emotional trauma suffered by Louis and how his uncontrollable grief drives him to do something unspeakable. His heartache is such that his logic centre simply stops functioning; not only does he completely accept the fact that Ellie can be brought back, but he also ignores Jud's warnings that she will not be his Ellie. Like in the book, he's a man of science, who clashes with Rachel about what to tell Ellie regarding death - she wants to talk about an afterlife, he wants to focus on the finality of death as something natural and unavoidable. This is a smart choice by King, as Louis becomes the one who refuses to let death have the final word, with his conscious mind unable to accept the random tragedy that has befallen him, and whose entire purpose in life comes to be focused on the fact that Rachel was (at least in part) correct, that there is something after death. He must forget everything he has ever known about the corporeal world in order to travel the path down which Ellie's death launches him; this gives him an inbuilt arc, from a man of medicine to a believer in resurrection.

Rachel's arc, and again, this is excellent writing by King and well handled in the film, moves in the opposite direction to Louis's - she accepts the finality of Ellie's death, and reacts in horror when she learns what her husband has done. Her arc is rendered more complex insofar as she also suffers crippling guilt because of the death of her sister Zelda (Alyssa Brooke Levine) when they were still children. Suffering from severe spinal meningitis, Rachel couldn't help but look at Zelda as a monster. One night, whilst their parents were out, Rachel made dinner for Zelda, but because she was afraid of her, rather than bringing it to the room in which Zelda was confined, she used the faulty dumb waiter to send it to her, leading to Zelda falling into the shaft and breaking her neck (a hideous death unflinchingly depicted in the film). Whereas Louis's arc is more concerned with the question of what it takes for a rational man to abandon everything he knows to be unassailably true about the nature of existence, Rachel's looks at questions of survivor guilt and how one is supposed to come back from having one's life shattered (of course, it's the very fact that Rachel had this early-life trauma that gives her the tools with which to cope with Ellie's death).

This is seriously heavy, unsettling stuff, and it's how King engages with it that has made the novel such a fan-favourite. And for about two-thirds of the runtime, the film deals reasonably convincingly with these issues. Sure, it moves faster than the novel, but that's more to do with the nature of medium than anything else. Even after Louis brings Ellie back, the film is still fairly leisurely paced, letting us observe his disintegrating mental state (one especially good scene sees him lying in bed next to the newly resurrected Ellie, with Clarke playing him as a man trying to convince himself that what is happening is perfectly normal). Whereas Kubrick largely ignored the themes of alcoholism and abuse in _The Shining_, Kölsch and Widmyer go in the opposite direction - grief and guilt are really the only things on which they focus. At least up to the point when they seem to forget about them entirely, as the third act descends into a ridiculously campy series of murders, attempted murders, and all-round violence, reminding me of the end of Shakespeare's _Titus Andronicus_, where Lucius kills Saturninus because Saturninus killed Titus because Titus killed Tamora because Tamora had Lavinia raped because Titus defeated Tamora in battle.

The last half-hour or so of the film is as superficial and immature as anything in any King adaptation, and the new ""twist"" ending not only doesn't work on its own terms, it completely undercuts both King's original themes, and how well the film itself had handled those themes earlier on, replacing King's bleakly poetic _dénouement_ with something right out of ""_horror clichés for dummies_"". In general terms, I've no problem with filmmakers altering the end of a literary adaptation; the finale of Frank Darabont's _The Mist_ (2007), for example, is completely different from King's novel, but it replicates the tone and spirit of the original, eliciting similar emotions from the audience. However, if you're going to alter the end of an adaptation, you absolutely need something that works, both in the context of the adaptation itself, and in its relationship to the original. _Pet Sematary_'s new ending does neither. The whole point of the end of the novel was that Louis learns nothing from his experience bringing Gage back, convincing himself that there were tangible reasons it didn't work, and under different circumstances, Gage would have returned as the Gage he was in life. The tragedy of the novel is that, lost in madness and despair, Louis repeats his mistakes. The end of the film has none of this, with the final shot more of a silly ""dun-dun-duuuun"" moment than anything with any emotional complexity.

The new ending may be the biggest problem, but it's by no means the only one. Another is something common to many films - an overly idealised family. An especially egregious example of this was Jordan Peele's _Us_ (2019), and there's more of the same here; much more so than in the novel, the Creeds are a picture postcard family, where everybody just loves everybody else so much, dad is always cracking jokes, sister hates annoying little brother (but loves him really), and parents talk to their kids like they're already fully grown adults. It's easy to see why this trope is usually found in horror and revenge movies - the more idealised the depiction when everything is going well, the more heartbreaking it will be when things go wrong. But just because the purpose is apparent, doesn't mean it isn't a cliché, and the Creeds of the film elicit some serious eye-rolling. Another big problem is the aforementioned trailer, which not only tells us about the switch from Ellie to Gage, but which also gives away a major plot point from just prior to the finale, which, if I hadn't already known about from the novel, would have been ruined. Speaking of Ellie, she doesn't just get hit by a truck, she's flattened by a massive tanker that should have turned her into a pancake, but when Louis picks her body up, she's still whole, and when we see her in the coffin, there's literally not a mark on her. Why make the crash so spectacular in the first place when the body has to be intact for the rest of the movie?

The film also leaves out a lot (almost all) of the backstory concerning the burial ground. So, there's no extended flashback telling the story of Bill Bateman and what happened when he resurrected his son Timmy, whose body had been shipped home after he was killed in WWII, although Louis does briefly come across a news article about a Vietnam veteran named Timmy Bateman who returned from the dead many years previously. Additionally, the rich mythology of the burial ground and the role of the Wendigo (an evil necromantic spirit spoken of in Algonquin folklore) is mostly absent; Louis sees a picture of the Wendigo in a book (that's in the trailer too), but it's unnamed, and later, he thinks he sees something in the distance of the fog-shrouded forest, but that's as close as we ever get to the spirit that turns up a couple of times in King's mythology (as well as _Pet Sematary_, it also features in _The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon_). These changes aren't overly surprising, however, as they speak to the streamlining that all narratives must undergo when being adapted for the screen.

There is one extremely irritating omission, however. In the film, Jud is full of dire warnings about the evil of the burial ground and the danger of using its powers (""_sometimes, dead is better_""; ""_that place has a power...its own evil purpose_""), which makes you wonder why he told Louis about it in the first place. The film tries to explain this by showing us that Jud doesn't want to see Ellie upset over Church's death, which makes not a lick of sense and is grossly out of character, evidenced by the fact that literally the day after showing Louis the burial ground, Jud is already warning him about its dangers. In the novel, however, he has a different reason. When his wife, Norma (absent from the film), has a heart attack, Louis saves her life, and in return, Jud tells him about the burial ground by way of thanks. It's still a poor way of having Louis learn about the site, but it's a damn sight better than ""_I didn't want your daughter to be upset about her cat dying, so I'm going to tell you how to make a demon cat!_""

As a novel, _Pet Sematary_ is a study of grief and childhood trauma first, a horror narrative second. Investigating our psychological reaction to death, the book probes how far we might go to ensure a loved one never leaves us. As a film, _Pet Sematary_ seems to be charting a similar course, until it abandons this tack in favour of a shock-for-shock's sake ending. Much like _It: Chapter One_, there is an over-reliance on predictable and silly jump scares, and ultimately, what could have been a mature and emotionally affecting story gives in to the worst excesses of the genre, betraying both itself and the original novel.",2019-08-17T00:04:24.597Z,5.0,Pet Sematary,2019

Dr. Louis Creed and his wife, Rachel, move from Boston to Ludlow, in rural Maine, with their two young children. Hidden in the woods near the new family home, Ellie, their eldest daughter, discovers a mysterious cemetery where the pets of community members are buried.

Not as bad as I was fearing it would be, but is it really any better than the original film?. Itself a simply ordinary adaptation from what is a very good book, you would have thought the 2019 version would at least bring some fresh life to the story. Yet albeit that some changes have been made (one of which was moronically shown in the trailers), it's still a re-tread that has failed to entice newcomers to this world. 

There's some good on show, though. Child actor Jeté Laurence is excellent, particularly in the latter part of the pic. The design for the Pet Sematary and the surrounding areas are splendidly eerie, with photographer Rose deserving a better film really. While the sound work out at the special place is also bang on the tonal money.

The ending has provided much division, but personally it was a change that I liked.

38321,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"A film just in my style. It’s a future/alternate reality kind of apocalyptic action/horror movie. Fairly simple and straightforward plot where the good guys stays pretty much stays as the good guys throughout the move and the hero is really someone that kicks ass throughout the movie. No bloody fussing around with making the hero “human” or some crap like that.

The special effects and the apocalyptic sceneries where well done. In general the film was a solid piece of work. The transfer to Blu-ray equally well done. Picture quality was as to be expected and the DTS Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack well balanced with just enough surround effects and LFE to make it very enjoyable.

The film get a 5.7 rating at IMDB which in my mind is a bit on the low side but then, it’s not really a film for everyone. The so called “critics” at Rotten Tomatoes gave it 17% which is just pure bullshit but then I have given up on those idiots a long time ago.

38321,CinemaSerf,"Whatever did happen to Cam Gigandet? Perhaps a career in carpentry? Let’s face it, he was pretty wooden himself and he wasn’t the only one in this lively but predictable fantasy adventure. It’s really all about a highly-trained and lethal priest (Paul Bettany) who is convinced that the status quo between mankind and vampire that has existed for generations is about to be ruptured. He takes his concerns to his boss - the “Monsignor” (Christopher Plummer) who presides over the all-powerful church that protects humanity - but he doesn’t believe him and reminds him of his vow of obedience. Well we wouldn’t have had a film if he’d stuck to them, so off he heads into the desert in search of a kidnapped young girl. That’s where he encounters the enthusiastic but naïve young sheriff (Gigandet) who happens to be her boyfriend and an equally agile priest (Maggie Q). It doesn’t take them (or us) long to discover that they are chasing a special kind of creature who can make short work and an easy dinner from any of the people he meets. What’s their antagonist’s agenda though, and can this trio thwart him and rescue the girl before he carries out his dastardly plan? To be fair, there is loads of action here and though hardly stretched, Bettany is adequate in the title role keeping things moving along. The rest of the acting and the dialogue is all pretty mundane and we get an early indication of just how unremarkable an actor Karl Urban is too.

169219,Wuchak,"**_Trying to discover the truth about the Dyatlov Pass Incident of 1959_**

Five students from the University of Oregon obtain a grant to conduct an expedition to the infamous pass in the northern Ural Mountains to try to figure out what happened to the nine Russian hikers who perished there 53 years earlier. While the excursion starts out promising, things go from bad to worse. 

“Devil’s Pass” (2013) is found footage adventure/horror/sci-fi that’s way better than I thought it’d be, speaking as someone who’s generally not big on found footage flicks, unless they’re done right. What’s great about this one is that the cast & crew literally went to the snowy mountains in Russia to shoot the film.

Yet it wasn’t shot anywhere near the Dyatlov Pass, but rather in and around Kirovsk, which is in extreme northwest Russia not far south of eastern Sápmi, aka Lapland. This is roughly 3400 miles northwest of the infamous pass, by vehicle. They obviously shot here because it was more accessible and cheaper compared to filming near the remote pass, not to mention the Khibiny Mountains are generally more scenic in a rugged sense compared to the Urals.

I like how various theories are thrown around in the story with commentary on The Philadelphia Experiment circa 1943. However, that alleged event had zero to do with teleportation, but rather attempted to make the USS Eldridge ‘invisible’ to radar detection by manipulating magnetic fields.

As for what the students find at Kholat Syakhl, aka Dead Mountain, let’s just say that the scriptwriter Frankenstein-ed the concept of Nightcrawler of the X-Men.

This movie is, of course, a fantastical account, but what really happened at Dyatlov Pass in 1959? The top theory is that 3 feet of shifting snow during the snowstorm suddenly fell on the tent at night, which panicked the nine inhabitants. Fearful of an actual avalanche, they cut themselves out of the tent and fled without proper attire. When they realized an avalanche wasn't going to happen, some tried to make it back to the tent but died of hypothermia in the -13 degrees Fahrenheit weather (it was no doubt difficult to find the camp in those conditions). What happened to the others is well explained in an 11-minute documentary called ""Is Dyatlov Pass Mystery Finally Solved,"" available for free on Youtube (jump to 7:33 to skip the recap of the entire incident).      

It runs 1 hour, 40 minutes. Additional scenes were shot in Krasnaya Polyana in Sochi, Russia, by the Caucasus Mountains, just northwest of Georgia.

While “Paranormal Activity 2” improves upon the original in a few areas, the film’s underwhelming conclusion ultimately brings it down. The first “Paranormal Activity” was more effective because of its slower but steadily increasing levels of tension and unease; this time around, the tempo is a little over the place. The story isn’t bad on its own, but it falls apart as soon as you connect it with the original. The first film had a more intriguing concept, with a demon nearly showing affection towards Katie, rather than the same old pact with the devil nonsense this one has going on. As a standalone film, Paranormal Activity 2 is a passable horror flick that, like its predecessor, excels at keeping things straightforward. If you liked the first film in the Paranormal Activity franchise, you’d appreciate this one just as much, and even if you didn’t, you might want to give it a go because it’s different enough to appeal to those who didn’t enjoy the previous one.",2022-11-01T14:37:26.792Z,6.0,Paranormal Activity 2,2010

254191,Reno,"A low budget horror movie from a newcomer director. In that perspective, it was a decent movie, because within the limits everything was done nicely. In fact, it was a minimal cast movie set in an isolated cabin in the woods. A simple story that is like the title, it is about a newly married couple's honeymoon. All sets off nicely to them until strange events begin to follow one after another. How the couple manages to come off of it, or do they is the rest.

I don't know others, but like I said it was not a bad movie to me. Whatever happened, it just kept me engaged throughout, because of the uptight plot. Though, it raises some questions about the events that takes place in the movie and makes to have your own imagination. In fact, my opinion in the begging was 'big foot', later very quickly I understood what it's about. The writer's notion was also the same, leaving blank space to fill by the viewers with their creative prediction.

The most of the answers answered or going to be answered are merely the same (I think). For those who won't get it, will suffer nothing except think they wasted time. The rest will probably want a sequel for a proper and further explanation. Especially a couple of dialogues made me think that way. But, I don't think so there will be one, it will stay a mystery as of now forever, if I'm not wrong. Not a scary movie nor actual violence, but the suspense was the movie's strong hold. If you're looking for that type, you can give it a try other than blood gore and killings.

David Howard Thornton stars as Art the Clown and his portrayal is devilishly effective as a villain who is mute and must use facial gestures to express himself in his ghoulish clown makeup. The story is the usual cat and mouse variety but this film is more about watching Art capture, torture and mutilate his victims. Terrifier is an effective and bloody slasher film that follows the usual formula of 1980's horror films and has crowned Art the Clown as one of the new faces of horror.",2019-07-21T22:02:10.366Z,8.0,Terrifier,2016
420634,Nathan,"_Terrifier_ had a lot of hype behind it with its very successful sequel hitting theaters this month, and unfortunately it did not translate to a pleasurable viewing experience. Before I jump into my criticisms of the film, the on-screen quality of visuals and effects were top notch for a budget of a mere $25,000. It is amazing what this crew was able to do with their conditions and everyone involved should be proud. With that being said, the limited budget does not give excuses for a poor script, dialogue and performances. This movie had a tremendous amount of cringe with perverted dialogue that seemed as if a middle schooler wrote it. The performances were campy, but not in a good way. In classic horror films the camp has a sense of nostalgia and a sign of the times but with this modern film with kills and elements that are taking themselves somewhat seriously, it just comes off as bad. The actor behind Art did do a fantastic job though. His portrayal of a mute killer who communicates to his victims with mimes and clown tricks was funny and chilling at the same time. The plot on its face did not have much depth to it. It boiled down to people in the wrong place at the wrong time. There was no added depth or lore to why these events were happening, although I did enjoy how each character who was tragically murdered had a connection the plot and were not just some random people introduced and killed in a single scene just to pad the kill count. As horror film, this movie failed to add any stakes or tension. The director leaned more into the gore which can be unsettling to look at but never made me feel uneasy. There was no build up to any of the kills, these classic horror elements made the movie seem extremely bland. Overall, I think this film is a marvel from a technical perspective based on its low budget, but when judging it from a film perspective it left me bored and waiting for the credits.

420634,CinemaSerf,"""Tara"" (Jenna Kanell) and best pal ""Dawn"" (Catherine Corcoran) have had a bit too much to drink to drive when they encounter a rather melancholy looking clown. The latter woman makes some snide remarks before both revert to a pizza place to try and sober up. Guess who comes in? So far it's all a bit benign, but when the girls return to their car to discover a flat tyre and ""Tara"" desperate for a pee, a nearby building proves tempting for it's plumbing - but of course it's not what it appears nor is our rather sad friend anywhere near done with his (or her) evening's work. As slasher's go, this is actually quite fun and there's a bit of menace aided well by the paucity of dialogue from our calculating antagonist. Sadly, though, that cannot be extended into the characterisations of the two women who just annoyed pretty much from the get go. Loud, obnoxious and capable of some of the most stupid decisions ever committed to celluloid. Things get even more preposterous when sister ""Victoria"" (Samantha Scaffidi) turns up to collect the stranded pair and proves to be even more dumb than her sibling when it comes to risk taking and wandering about a derelict old building at night - all whilst the radio has been relaying warnings of a marauding slasher about town. It's mercifully short, which does help keep the pace tight but the acting from those with speaking parts is pretty woeful, as it the writing that gives them their lines - and by the end, I was very, very, much in the corner of a baddie who ought to have been left to get on with the job!",2024-09-28T08:39:11.014Z,6.0,Terrifier,2016

The gory stuff is done to a decent degree, even if those moments are a bit too few and far between. Art the Clown certainly looks and acts the part, even if I wanted more from the character - giving him a voice would've made him more creepy in my opinion, rather than complete silence.

This 2016 flick was made on a tiny budget, something that is very evident throughout, but given that you do have to hold appreciation for the filmmakers.

345940,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Well, when the credits started to roll I cannot say that I felt it had been a waste of time and money. I did indeed have some enjoyment watching this movie. However, it could have been a lot better.

For starters, what is the point of making a movie about a bloody “dinosaur shark” and aim for a PG-13 rating? Whoever made that incredibly stupid decision obviously missed the mark big time. I think this was the biggest fault with the movie. There were so many missed opportunities. The entire scene at the beach at the end of the movie was just wasted for example.

The script was of course somewhat illogical with holes in it large enough to drive a, well, a Megalodon through them. This however was something that I more or less expected given the kind of movie. First of all it is science fiction and fantasy after all and second, it appears that these kind of movies never seem to get anything better than mediocre script writers…at best.

There were some good things though. I have read the book and I didn’t really like it. In my review I gave it 2 out 5 five stars. The main reason for this was that the book was more of a bad soap opera than a horror/thriller. It was so filled with unlikable, scheming and backstabbing assholes that it was really not enjoyable. Jason’s ex wife was such a despicable bitch that she alone ruined the book for example.

Luckily the movie had toned down that aspect of the book quite a lot. Actually, in the end, there was really only one truly despicable asshole in the movie and he met with the fate that he deserved thanks to his own stupidity.

So, I did enjoy the movie and, as a science fiction and fantasy fan, I am glad to have watched it. I mean, a giant pre-historic shark on the big screen does have a certain cool-factor after all.

You have to take in to context the post release statements by director Jon Turteltaub and lead actor Jason Statham. The Meg is not the film they either read on the page or filmed as a course of grisly schlock entertainment. This was meant to be a proper schlocker, a bloodletting monster of the deep on the loose picture, sadly the suits at the helm didn't see that as a viable money making exercise and had this cut to be a ""12"" friendly bums on theatre seats cash grabber. Shame on them.

What we get is a run of the mill creature feature that although once viewed does not leave a lasting impression (was anyone really hoping for that anyway?), but is kind of fun in that time filling sort of way. It runs through the modern day creature feature playbook 101. So off we go with the hero having a troubled backstory, a money made funder out of his depth, ladies with life quandaries, a man who can't swim working in the middle of the ocean! and on we go. Throw in some quite awfully scripted dialogue and it's cheese sarnie time.

Statham is nearly always a good watch - in the muscle bound action hero kind of way - though you see the cracks between what the film was meant to be and what it ended up as. For you see that The Stath comes off as taking it all too seriously, which in this released cut is ridiculous. He's surrounded by no mark actors, though no short supply of beauty (Bingbing Li socko gorgeous/Ruby Rose hard sexy) and the narrative feeds us all the pointers of exactly where this will end up. There's a couple of nifty fun homages to Jaws, some decent suspense scenes, and the cinematography (Tom Stern) is pin sharp and pleasurable.

Best bet to enjoy this is to know it's a ""12"" rated friendly piece, to understand it has ultimately ended up as a same old same old monster movie. It's a million miles away from the class of Jaws, and lacks the tongue in cheek knowing of Deep Blue Sea, but it fills a gap in that undemanding time wasting way. 5/10",2019-05-25T08:18:00.126Z,5.0,The Meg,2018

It’s a pretty unadventurous title that matches the content of the film. Directed by Steve Beck and starring Gabriel Byrne, Desmond Harrington, Ron Eldard and Julianna Margulies, plot finds a salvage crew discovering a long lost passenger liner out in the remote Bering Sea. With the laws of the sea stating that they can keep what they find, they are delighted to find gold on board. But it’s not long before strange things start to happen.

It starts of real well with a bloody and gruesome prelude, the production design is super and everything is in place for a chiller out there in the foggy waters. Unfortunately what we actually get is a predictable series of clichés cribbed from better movies of the past, none of which capable of eliciting a genuine scare. The makers think that having a bombastic techno score accompanying the dramatic moments will make them appear more shocking. It doesn’t, while the cast are ill served by direction and writing.

RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Steve Beck, ""Ghost Ship"" revolves around salvagers finding a mysterious ship in the Bering Sea that's been lost for four decades and they intend to claim it, but things go from strange to worse as they board the eerie vessel and try to tow it to harbor.

The cast is strong, headed by Gabriel Byrne. Emily Brown appears as a 12 year-old girl. Julianna Margulies looks fine but they don't do enough with her. Francesca Rettondini is also on hand. Let's just say the low-budget ""Ghost Voyage"" (2008) is better in the area of women.

Still, the ship sets are excellent and it certainly seems like they shot the film on a real vessel. Interestingly, the Antonia Graza of the movie is a replica of the Andrea Doria.  Other positives include: The refreshing score with “Not Falling” by Mudvayne thrown in for good measure; a nice haunting atmosphere at sea with one creepy scene reminiscent of the excellent “Dead Calm” (1989); potent visuals of the formidable vessel looming over the tugboat; plus some good thrills, notably one of the greatest horror scenes in the history of cinema in the prologue, no kidding. There's also a decent revelation thrown in at the end.

If you like this one be sure to check out the aforementioned ""Ghost Voyage,"" which is a TV movie. ""Ghost Ship"" was released to theaters and obviously had a bigger budget, but that doesn't mean it's better, just that it's more polished.

After surviving the second wave of ghostface killings, Sidney Prescott has retired to the mountains to live in peace and work as a phone call therapist. Sadly for her she is about to be dragged back into the nightmare because the production of Stab 3 is rocked by murder and the killer is leaving pictures of Sidney's dead mother at the crime scenes.

I have to admit that I once never gave this film much love, I loved the first two to such a degree that I felt this third and final instalment was way off being a fitting closure to what was at the time a trilogy. Yet as time has wore on I have really grown fond of the film, Parker Posey no longer annoys the hell out of me, the once jarring itch of watching the makers kill off a fave character of mine in the opening sequence is something I now view as a masterstroke, and the twisty ending that was once an irksome pest has moved on to be the perfect ""trilogy"" closure.

Scream 3 has its tongue firmly in its cheek, it's aware of its number and it's aware of its formulaic root, so in spite of treading familiar ground (I mean come on gang, have you not learnt nothing from your previous experiences), the returning characters still have our undivided attention. While the transporting of the story to Hollywood, with its movie within a movie structure, is fresh and adds a new dimension to proceedings. New additions to the scary fun are Patrick Dempsey, Emily Mortimer, Lance Henriksen and the afore mentioned Parker Posey, and all of them add greatly to the mysterious plot unfolding.

The death quotient is still high, and the Wes Craven school of whodunitry is well and truly open, and I personally feel that this one is easily the funniest film of the three, witness Jay & Silent Bob turning up, a Carrie Fisher sequence that once heard will never be forgotten, and a video appearance by passed on geek god Randy Meeks. Scream 3 closes the ""trilogy"" just fine, it's got bags of energy and a glint in its eye, now if only I could get a copy of the uncompleted Stab 3 off the internet - and if only there wasn't to be a part 4 further down the line... 7/10",2015-07-19T17:32:15.444Z,7.0,Scream 3,2000
4234,CinemaSerf,"Not even a brief cameo from ""Princess Leia"" herself - passing lively comment on George Lucas's casting techniques, can save this entirely derivative trequel. Amidst the filming of ""Stab 3"", people start to drop like flies almost exactly as they might following script of this soon to be completed masterpiece. The new slasher starts as he/she/it means to go on, by dispatching poor old ""Cotton"" (Liev Schreiber) and his girlfriend before turning attention to the old guard of ""Sidney"" (Neve Prescott), Courteney Cox (""Gale"") - and their movie-star doppelgängers whilst the indomitable ""Dewey"" (David Arquette) laudably, but ineffectively, keeps a look out as the corpses pile up. This is a really poor rehash of the original with almost exactly the same plot with the same red herrings, screeching hysteria and audio-induced jump-points. Although the structure of the story is marginally different, the ending is just as ridiculously left field and reminded me of something Agatha Christie might have drafted before she tossed it on the fire.

4234,Nathan,"**_Scream 3’s_ lackluster screenplay and unimaginative kills leave a film that is a bore to watch.**

The meta-narrative of trilogies throughout the film does not make up for how abysmal the plot was. This film creates so much lore for the past movies seemingly out of the blue, muddling up the continuity for shock value. It added very little to this film and felt forced. The entire plot point of Sidney’s mother being a former Hollywood actress was pretty lame, especially with the added plot point of her being sexually assaulted by a movie producer. It may be personal taste, but I absolutely despise when films add that plot point, as it feels incredibly hypocritical since it is something that genuinely happens to an industry, they are involved in. The love triangle between Gale, Dewey, and the Gale actress was pretty dumb and felt undeserved, as we have not seen Gale and Dewey actually together in any of the films.

In horror films, you can have a good movie with a terrible plot as long as the kills are great. Unfortunately, Scream 3 continues the trend of having boring kills with no imagination. There has been only one truly unique kill throughout the entire franchise, and the rest are unbloody stab kills. I understand the meta being about stabbing with a knife, as the in-film movie is called Stab, but please add some gore to it. There is nothing, no blood squirts or body horror, and it caused the entire movie to be boring.

Our performances were exactly how I would describe Scream 2, with both Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox being the standouts and David Arquette being average at best. All of the new characters were pretty uninteresting, all of the actors in the film were annoying, and the movie producers felt generic.

The direction of this film felt pretty uninspired. I am not sure if Wes Craven was forced to make this movie by the studio, but nothing about it felt unique and creative. It felt like he was phoning it in for a paycheck.

Overall, there were not a lot of redeeming qualities for this film, and it left me feeling unfulfilled as the final credits rolled. Hoping Scream IV has more in store for me than this lackluster film.

9877,slayrrr666,"Following a series of strange murders, a group of students at a college campus set out to investigate the crimes and their seeming connection to the killer when they find out the killer is basing their crimes on urban legends and set out to stop the rampage.

This is far better than its reputation would have it. Among the better features here is the fact that back when this movie came out the gimmick of using the deaths based on urban legends allowed for some pretty inventive and original kills. The opening backseat driver decapitation is a great one to open a film on, the dead boyfriend suspended over a fleeing car in the woods offers some rather nice suspense with the killer appearing and continually trying to break into the car and the sex/strangulation misidentification is really cool mainly because the circumstances needed to make it true, from the back-story needed to make sure she shouldn't see anything, the killer gaining access to the room without violent means, and the actual sounds of the incident, are all mixed together and makes a marvelous scene. These here really work nicely due to the way they incorporate the whole mythology of the premise into their stalking and work incredibly well at bringing these together. Other great scenes, where she watches someone in the killers known attire stalk one of her friends in a swimming pool while she is helplessly trying to get her attention or the tense stalking of the DJ in the radio station during the thunderstorm make for some additional tense, thrilling scenes, and the way it works out due to knowing what the killer is dressed like is effective enough. That also leads into the twist about the identity of the killer and how their secret is kept, as the way there are so many different red herrings involved and all of them given good alibis to clear them, so by gaining more clues to their identity, it broadens the suspense by making an extra clue for the people to solve. These here really work nicely for the film as there isn’t a whole lot really to dislike here. The main problem with this film is that it was aimed for the masses to consume, so it has a lot of toned-down gore. Many of these killings should've been gorier, and it will probably disappoint many out there looking for a good gory slasher film. It also falls into the realm of those films where they're trying to poke fun of the genre at the same time as trying to scare, and here is one example that having a ton of cheap scares aren't that frightening. What makes it worse is that many of the jokes aren't funny, so it is a bit flat in some places. The pacing is a little off in the first half with all the build-ups to the class and what they all mean, but there’s not a whole lot else wrong here.

9877,jon99,"Urban Legend is a movie I watched during a long weekend marathon of older slasher movies that seem to have been forgotten, or at least aren't as heralded as the more well-known movies of the genre (Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, etc.). Among these lesser known movies, I would have to say that Urban Legend deserves to stand above, as it is more entertaining, more enjoyable, and more slick than you would expect.

The concept here is more important than the story. Whereas Scream created a slasher movie where the characters and the killers were horror movie obsessives, Urban Legend does the same for...well, urban legends. The concept is inherently clever, as urban legends are stories and bedtime tales that are meant to induce a sense of fear and paranoia about whether they're true. As our final girl learns the hard way, convincing people to believe in these stories is a difficult task.

The main attraction here apart from the premise is the cast. Ignoring their late-90s star power, the cast is still packed with beautiful people knowingly playing up the qualities that the audiences will enjoy the most. Fans of Jared Leto will enjoy guessing whether his mysterious character is the killer or just a red-herring. Alicia Witt and Rebecca Gayheart prove to be believable and relatable best buddies who each keep a dark secret from each other. Meanwhile, Joshua Jackson shows up long enough to deliver the movie's best laughs and a fresh-faced Tara Reid gives the teenage boys bouncing cleavage while she runs. Lastly, Loretta Devine gives us an authority figure who is absolutely worth rooting for.

The movie is not shy about its self-awareness. It knows it's silly, it knows it's preposterous. It knows that you know this as well, and it takes that knowledge and runs, well aware that you can keep up. And the kills are fun, exciting, and clever, which is what everyone wants most of all from a slasher movie, right?",2019-02-01T23:04:44.311Z,9.0,Urban Legend,1998

9877,T_Snow,"**Urban Legend (1998) – Pure Slasher Fun**

I revisited *Urban Legend* on a whim during a lazy weekend horror binge, expecting something disposable and forgettable. What I got instead was a sharp-looking, fast-moving slasher with a cool premise, a ridiculously attractive cast, and just the right mix of camp and sincerity. It's much better than most people give it credit for.

The concept is instantly fun: a series of campus murders modeled after classic urban legends. It’s such a natural fit for the slasher genre, and the movie runs with it, committing to the bit fully. The kills are clever, the suspense is well-staged, and the movie has a clear sense of visual polish. The rain-slicked campus, the chilly lecture halls, and the gothic dorm buildings all looks *really* good, especially compared to some of the cheaper genre entries from the time.



Watching this now, I can’t help but laugh at how my teenage self would’ve been swooning over every guy in this movie. Jared Leto’s brooding face and blue eyes, Joshua Jackson with his bleach-blond charm, and even Michael Rosenbaum with that frat boy confidence. But it's the women steal the show. Alicia Witt makes for a solid, grounded final girl, even if she’s not the flashiest. Rebecca Gayheart, on the other hand, goes absolutely off the rails in the best way possible. Her performance is so wild and unrestrained, and I mean that as the highest compliment. She throws herself into it with zero fear, and it *works*.

And look, I’m just gonna say it: Tara Reid was hot. Her chase scene is the most memorable part of the movie, not just for how it’s shot and paced, but because you can’t take your eyes off her. She’s running in platform boots, hair flying, that low-cut top bouncing along with her frankly amazing cleavage. She knows exactly what she’s doing. It’s sexy, silly, and there’s something unapologetically trashy about it in a way that really fits the tone of the movie. I loved her for it.

And Loretta Devine as the campus security officer? A total legend. She brings this calm, steady energy that the movie really benefits from.

*Urban Legend* isn’t trying to change the genre. It’s just trying to entertain you, and it absolutely succeeds. It’s slick, sexy, well-paced, and never boring. Honestly, it deserves a lot more love. If you’re into slashers and haven’t seen this one in a while (or ever), do yourself a favor. It’s a good time.",2025-07-12T17:52:05.426Z,10.0,Urban Legend,1998

Has the hallmarks of a a film from that era, with the direction (and camera angles) plus the inclusions of Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie franchise) and Matthew Lillard (Scream franchise) in there. Also, the twist at the end didn't make a lick of sense. That said, can't say I was ever bored and honestly, if anyone actually remembered this movie, the setting would make for a fun scare house (and using special glasses to see the entities) somewhere like at the Universal Horror Nights or w/e it's called.

Who would have thunk it, that one of Stephen King's short stories would spawn a gargantuan movie franchise? Children of the Corn is one of those movies that horror fans of a certain age, who started to blossom in the 1980s, remember fondly but agree that now it's a bit, well, corny.

Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton get trapped in a village of the damned where the children have killed the adults and established a religious order that gives worship to the devil of the corn. Isaac Chroner (John Franklin) and Malachai Boardman (Courtney Gains) head the creepy kid cult, corn does sway, blood does flow, poor special effects do down the devil, yet it's atmospheric as heck fire and still a bunch of fun if you forgive it its dated foibles. 6/10",2019-05-21T07:24:45.534Z,6.0,Children of the Corn,1984
10823,Wuchak,"***Children of the damned… in the cornfields of the American prairie***

A young couple traveling through the endless cornfields of Nebraska (Peter Horton & Linda Hamilton) visits a town so far off the beaten track it’s not even on the map. Yet it seems abandoned, except for some kids scurrying around. Horror ensues.

“Children of the Corn” (1984) takes the remote Plains town setting of “The Last Picture Show” (1971) and gives it a horror spin based on Stephen King’s short story. The later “Husk” (2011) used the same template. King, however, wasn’t pleased with the results, as conveyed in his statement: ""My feeling is like a guy who sends his daughter off to college. You hope she'll do well. You hope she won't fall in with the wrong people. You hope she won't be raped at a fraternity party, which is pretty well what happened to Children of the Corn.""

The uninhabited town with scavenging kids makes the film come across as a post-apocalyptic flick. The protagonists are likable and the movie works up some creepy rural mood. People have described the film as sacrilegious, but it’s clear that the kids’ hybrid religion is not a true expression of Christianity since it’s clearly sullied by “he who walks behind the rows.” One of the picture’s criticisms is the ambiguity of this thing, but I suppose enough is revealed to put the pieces together. Still, the lack of exposition is disappointing. And the gaudy effects in the last act are lousy.

Another arguable negative is the portrayal of the cult with the use of child & teen actors. I think they did pretty good all things considered. The growing schism between leader Isaac (John Franklin) and chief disciple Malachai (Courtney Gains) is interesting. It’s just difficult to portray diabolic cults, like witches and satanists, without getting eye-rolling and laughable. 

In any case, imagine the casting auditions for Malachai wherein the producers are looking for a tall teenage boy with a mean face and shocking mane. Courtney Gains enters the room and answers some questions when the producers state: ""This is going well; you've just about got it clinched. But, as a formality, could you shout ‘Outlander’ at the top of your lungs?”     

The movie runs 1 hour, 32 minutes, and was shot mainly in Iowa.

(Review is spoilerish)

Coming on the heels of last summer's surprise success _The Shallows_, comes this summer's laughable attempt to portray shark behavior. While shark movies since _Jaws_ have been scientifically inaccurate, you have to throw a movie like _Jaws_ a bone because, well, it's _Jaws_. It was a wonderfully made film, released at a time when we knew little to nothing about the nature of great white sharks. After 30 years of documentaries and Shark Week, the cinematic shark is still a mindless villain whose soul reason for existing is to move the plot forward, and eat it when it cannot.

I'd like to say what _47 Meters Down_ lacks in accuracy it makes up for in plot, suspense, and characters. But that's just not true. The script seemed to be a first draft, full of plot holes and non-existent characterization. It was a typical tell-not-show movie, where characters, through dialogue, literally explained themselves to the audience, rather than establish themselves through action.

The film opens with a pretentious and symbolic shot of a spilled drink to mimic blood in the water, I guess, in case, you didn't know this was a shark movie? We narrow our focus to two American sisters vacationing in Mexico. Later in the movie, when the script necessitates it, the younger sister, Kate, is portrayed as athletic, heroic, courageous, and endowed with other noble attributes. We learn this not through 20 minutes of established characterization, but through the older sister, Lisa, lamenting about how she is the shy, boring one, while Kate is more adventurous and outgoing. 

Instead, the first 20 minutes of the film establishes Kate as nothing more than a party girl--making out with strange men, doing tequila shooters, dancing on the beach. We find out that Kate is kind of awesome, but only because Lisa, virtually, says to the audience, ""My sister is awesome."" But in the 20 minutes of exposition we get on the sisters, all we really have to work with is what amounts to a music video--quick shots of drinking and dancing.

Lisa's characterization--while presented in the amateur way of awkward dialogue (Hey, ""sis""--in case you didn't get that they were sisters--I'm here because of this terrible thing that's going on with my boyfriend, and that's my motivation for the next 90 minutes)--is at least presented to us. However, in tripe ripped from the most unromantic and unfunny of romantic comedies, Lisa's every action--including, apparently, kissing another man--is to impress some guy back in the States who has already left her. You know, because a woman's self worth and sense of identity is tied directly to a man (insert eye roll here).

Now the movie becomes a movie. The sisters head out to sea to go shark diving, encountering a captain who goes back and forth between paternally concerned and grossly negligent, and a mate who is, for all intents a purposes, a total dick for reasons never explained.

After we've established that Lisa has never dove (dived?) before, and that Captain Taylor is perfectly fine with that (the equivalent of taking someone who's never driven before and entrust them with a semi on our highways), and that shark cage and winch system is faulty--essentially telegraphing everything that is going to go wrong--the girls get in the water, see some sharks swimming around and then, plummet to the bottom, 47 meters down.

The film becomes both engaging and obnoxious at this point. The sharks are out there, lurking in the darkness, popping up for scares here and there to jolt the audience. At that point it becomes like a monster movie--a haunted house type movie, with our two protagonists trapped in a metaphorical basement. That's all well and dandy, as are the scenes of pure suffocating terror. There's an almost psychological horror element in some scenes, with Lisa so disoriented in the darkness, she doesn't know which way to swim to reach safety. 

However, the situational suspense wears thin quickly. Rather than using atmospheric suspense, the filmmakers relied on suspense through situations where everything goes wrong. Constantly. Putting on another tank of air takes 20 minutes. I was never sitting there saying, ""Oh my God, how are they going to get out of this situation!?"" I was going, ""Oh my God, how long is the director going to milk this scene for!?"" I wasn't in suspense; I was frustrated. 

Finally, we have an ending that could have--should have--saved the whole movie. It's hard to go into specifics without giving away MAJOR SPOILERS to a kind M. Night Shamaylanesque ""twist ending"" so you may want to stop reading now, though I intend to be as vague as possible.

Okay, what works with the ending...

It provides a nice twist that I didn't see coming. I thought it was very clever.

What didn't work? Well, unless you have some familiarity with diving at certain depths, it might seem as if it's coming out of left field. I understood what was happening, so I understood the ending. But for the uninformed, it might be confusing--and that confusion would ruin the impact. There simply wasn't proper information given to the audience to decipher the ending for themselves unless they familiar with things such as the so-called ""rapture-of-the-deep.""

But where the ending really shot itself in the foot was the denouement that follows and ties everything up in a nice, safe, Hollywood ending. Basically, if the movie had ended two minutes sooner, with the camera slowing pulling back from a girl trapped in a shark cage, the rest of the movie's sins could have been over looked.

One of the drawbacks though is the same that plagued Blair Witch Project: The ending _is_ the movie. But the first 80 minutes are not strong enough to get you to the final ten more than once or twice. I'll probably never see this film again. Despite that, I didn't despise it. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that it was the worst $11 I've ever spent or that I want the last two hours of my life back. It accomplished what it set out to do in the most shallowest of terms, and I'm good.

Despite it's many flaws, I was pleased with Mandy Moore's performance as Lisa. She seemed to be the only actor who was consistent in relying--through action, dialogue, demeanor and tone--exactly who her character was. Also, the film stayed away from the gratuitous T&A shots that plagued similar films like last year's _The Shallows_ (was Bake Lively's butt never _not_ in frame?) 2005's _Into the Blue_ that seemed to focus more on Paul Walker's abs and Jessica Alba's curves than the actual plot itself, and 1977's _The Deep_, best known for two hours of Jacqueline Bissett in a wet t-shirt.",2017-06-21T18:30:19.954Z,4.0,47 Meters Down,2017

Obviously it is this year's 'The Shallows'. So anther shark attack film, but this time it goes down to the Mexico. Two sisters vacationing somewhere on the coast of the Mexico, decides to go cage diving to see sharks with the locals they have met in the pub. It was intentional tale, so it all goes straight to the point without wasting much time. When their turn comes to go below in the sea, something goes wrong and they end up 47 meters down on the ocean floor with the limited oxygen supply. It's a long way up and dangerous to get to the surface without proper gears. Their struggles to get out of from there safely and other adventurous events covered in the remaining film.

From the not so famous filmmaker and the actors. But it's good to see Mandy Moore after a some time. I don't know how much realistic it is, though a decent thriller. Yeah, there are better films on this similar theme, but still this is enjoyable, especially if you are not a regular film goer. There are some fine edgy moments, but it did not maintain that till the last. The end twist was not bad. I truly did not expect that. That does not mean it was awesome. It was okay, works decently for such random films. Well made with production quality. Short runtime as well. So I think it is slightly better than what it has been rated. That means not bad for watching it once.

Sure, the underlying story is totally ludicrous. Come one, fighting giant monster with big clumsy robots that requires two people in some strange mind melt to maneuver is just ridiculous. Just send in a couple of fighter jets with some suitable devices that go boom and be done with it. But then, the purpose of these movies are to show off giant robot special effects and on that note they certainly deliver.

This installment in the franchise seems to be more geared towards the younger audience as far as the story and the cast goes. Some people like it, some don’t. Personally I’m fairly neutral.

As with the previous movie the story is not really that much to write home about. It has plot holes big enough to drive I giant robot through. I just had to say that didn’t I? Still, there are some parts of this story that I liked better than the first one. It is a quite straightforward story with clear heroes, clear bad guys.

It does not really have any of that lazy stupid plot twist where some dumb ass politicians are trying to shut down the program to save money. Sure the program is in some danger but this time it is due to a new program that actually sounds reasonable and could improve things. Of course said program gets sabotaged but hey, we, the audience, want our big silly robots right?

The story is also mostly devoid of any stupid SJW crap or silly green preaching. The ridiculous crap about Dinosaurs being the first invasion and that we had terraformed the planet (global warming and all that stuff) so a second invasion was more likely to succeed was just an insult to the more intelligent among the audience and took off a star or two from the first movie for me.

On the whole I quite enjoyed the movie. It delivered where it counts, that is in the special effects department. Loads and loads of special effects mostly involving giant robots and Kaijus slugging it out with massive property damage as a result. They are literally beating each other up with skyscrapers for Christ sake!

The story, acting and everything else is adequate. Nothing more and nothing less. I do miss some colorful characters like Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) from the first movie. The characters in this one was more bland that has to be said.

It seems like a lot of people on IMDb and elsewhere have their pants in a twist over this movie and rates it one or two stars out of ten. That’s just nonsense. A one star rating is for a movie that is truly awful in all aspects. The special effects alone elevates this movie above one star. You might not like the turn towards the younger audience or something else in the movie but it still does not make it a one star movie.

Sure if you are not a science fiction or fantasy fan and do not care about special effects then I guess you could feel this is an awful movie but then why did you watch it in the first place? It is the second installment in the franchise so it should come as no surprise that the movie lives and dies by it’s special effects.

I would say that if you like giant robots, monsters and special effects and don’t mind a fairly thin story aimed for the slightly younger audience then there is a fair change that you will find this movie entertaining.",2018-08-02T16:43:49.387Z,8.0,Pacific Rim: Uprising,2018

395,John Chard,"Monstrous - but not a total monstrosity.

Antartica, and an expedition is about to uncover a battleground for Aliens and Predators.

Whoever wins, we lose! So ran the tag line for Paul W. S. Anderson's prequel (?) to two fanatically worshipped franchises. Little was Anderson to know that it was the majority of cinema goers who would feel that they had ""lost"" their cash on coming out after watching this miss-matched effort. Though in truth nobody could seriously have expected a film to rival the best of both serials (Alien, Aliens & Predator), it's still right that us fans should expect the formula to be respectfully adhered too. We want character build up, we expect a group dynamic to function, and we definitely want the baddies to stay just that, as baddies.

It's not a total loss, though, even as Anderson all too quickly hurtles towards his ""humans caught in a cube like puzzle box"" blood bath, there is just enough back story and anticipation to tickle the tongue. In fact, when it all goes pear shaped and Xenomorphs, Pred-Rastas and humans are all lined up for slotting, it's damn near exciting stuff. While the pyramid/cube/maze design is pretty awesome. However, then the plus points are vanquished as the film quickly becomes kiddie friendly as gloop gives way to strawberry jelly, featuring a turn of events with our ""heroine"" that's so clumsy I'd be surprised if Anderson sleeps at night.

Still, it's obvious that Anderson loves both franchises and he in no way would have wanted to make a stinker. But he has made a very average movie, one that's got two things in its favour. One being that is the neat middle section, the other that it's not half as bad as the messy hack job that was AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem in 2007. 5/10",2016-03-08T00:16:20.043Z,5.0,Alien vs. Predator,2004
395,Gimly,"I can honestly say, that this is one of the most under-rated films of 2004.

Not because it was good, just because it was panned so fucking hard by critics! I think this is mostly due to the fact that it was being compared to both the Alien and Predator series, which is fair enough, but it was never going to be what either of those films was.

Ultimately it's downfall came from some poor dialogue, and trying to reach a larger audience. Where Predators was a film that you didn't need to have watched all the others in order to follow, it was still fundamentally a Predator film, aimed at the Predator-loving market. AVP on the other hand used references to the older films, but then completely threw the canon out the window and went for a larger fanbase. And whilst it worked to some degree (my grandma liked it) it wasn't enough of a step in either direction. AVP was complicated as a stand alone, and disastrous when compared to anything else in the franchise except perhaps its sequel Requiem (and maybe Predator 2 or Alien3).

Honestly I think the film works as an archetypal film in the realm of both Alien and Predator, just not a sequel or prequel to either. The lead protagonist is a woman by the name of Alexa Woods, portayed by Sanaa Lathan (Blade, Contagion) who was clearly meant to be a modern day Ripley, and catastrophically failed at doing so. The Predators were as cool as ever, and people complained that in the latter half of the film they weren't as ghostly as in Predator/Predator 2, but we've already had two whole films of that, and these were juvenile Predators, so it sort of made sense that they were a tad more restless.

Bringing Lance Henriksen (Damien: Omen II, Piranha II: The Spawning, The Terminator, Aliens, Alien 3, Pumpkinhead, The Quick and the Dead, Mind Ripper, Scream 3, The Lost Tribe) back was an awesome decision, one that was probably lost on the audience who had not seen the Alien series.

Tommy Flanagan (Smokin' Aces 1 and 2, Sin City, When a Stranger Calls [2006], Gladiator, Braveheart) is another an actor I love, it was a shame his character (Mark Verheiden) was so underused. Ultimately, the film is a good one to pick up and put down, don't think about it too much, don't compare it to the others, go in with your only expectation being that it's a monster-movie, then you won't come out too disappointed.

I'm not someone who has a keen interest in either franchise, though. I'm kinda surprised both have as many flicks made as they do and as many still on the way. I admittedly I do like all of the <em>'Alien'</em> films, whereas I found <em>'Predator'</em> to be rather uninteresting - until <em>'Prey'</em> anyway, that's the only one from that series that I'd say I like.

With all that, I wasn't too sure what to expect from <em>'AVP: Alien vs. Predator'</em> - a movie that I've actually heard of since I was a kid, I remember people at my school referring to it quite often; I probably knew of this before I knew that they were a crossover from separate releases. Pleasingly, i did find the required enjoyment from this 2004 movie.

None of the cast are particularly outstanding, though all work really nicely as a whole. Sanaa Lathan gives a good showing as the main human character, in what is my first real experience of seeing her onscreen. Same can be said for most of the acting talent, with only Ewen Bremner being someone I could say I recognised; and Lance Henriksen, only after thoroughly racking my brain from the original <em>'Alien'</em> films though.

9728,Wuchak,"***Somewhat fun and entertaining, but adds campiness and bad writing***

The first two films from 1980-1981 are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths at a remote camp, but the franchise introduced a campy element with this third installment, which pretty much plagued the rest of the series until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway. 

Still, this is the main detriment of ""Part III,” released in 1982. The opening credits song tips the viewer off that this isn't a wholly serious horror film (like the first two), which is compounded when a couple of the protagonists meet some sinister bikers at a convenience store in the boonies, which takes place about 25 minutes into the story. These hoodlums are too cartoonish to take serious and so it's hard to take the horror seriously either. This doesn't mean it's not entertaining in some ways, just that it's my least favorite installment.

The dubious writing doesn’t help. For instance, why does Fox go into the barn? Speaking of that dang barn, why on earth are so many characters preoccupied with it? It’s like the writer wanted to come up with any possible excuse to use the barn as a focal point. Also, why does Vera leave Shelly to go outside and hangout by herself? I realize she probably wanted to get away from the pathetic guy, but she informs him that she’s going to go outside with a sense of purpose and come back in, but she really doesn’t do much outside. Sequences like this reflect lame writing. 

Another noticeable difference between Part III and the two previous films is that, although the story takes place in the area of Crystal Lake, the film was shot in Southern Cal instead of the East Coast, specifically Santa Clarita, CA, and nearby Melody Ranch (where the barn is located). The geography is obviously dryer and the contrast in setting is too glaring. While it could be argued that the different environment provides a nice change of tone, the setting seems too one-dimensional.

As usual with the series, the film thankfully features a nice assortment of females: three white girls, a Hispanic and a black woman, the latter being the biker chick, Fox. It's hard to pick a favorite, but the main protagonist, Chris, played by Dana Kimmell, is probably it, followed by the stoner chick, Chili; not to mention Debbie and Vera (Debbie has a quality bikini scene).

BOTTOM LINE: Part III is entertaining in some ways and is notable for switching the filming locations to dry Southern California, not to mention Jason is bigger and more imposing than in Part II and he finally acquires his iconic hockey mask. Yet it’s my least favorite of the franchise due to the goofy elements, the subpar writing and the limited setting with too much focus on a freakin’ barn.

The film runs 95 minutes.

401561,tmdb28039023,"Mom and Dad is one of the weirder Nicholas Cage movies, and also one of the better. Here's a film with arguably the most disturbing birth scene ever, made even creepier by the Roxette ballad playing on the soundtrack; a film that asks, what would happen if the maternal instinct were suddenly replaced with the killer instinct? That the violence is exclusively intrafamiliar (i.e., any given set of parents is hell-bent on killing their own children but not those of, say, the next-door neighbors) is as twisted as a twist can get – and I mean that as a compliment.

The movie wisely doesn’t bother explaining the origin of the parents’ homicidal rage against their offspring; this is just one of those things cinema has led us to expect from America's deceptively peaceful suburbs. Also, the cause doesn't matter; what's important is that this premise is a perfect vehicle for Nic Cage's bipolar intensity (he works wonders with his facial language, going from smile to frown and back again in such a way that it’s almost impossible to determine which is more off-putting). His character, Brent, is a family man in the midst of a midlife crisis whose latent instability is cleverly established in a scene where he sets up a pool table in his ‘man cave’, only to destroy it with a sledgehammer when he can’t get the table's surface to achieve full horizontality.

Mom and Dad is a black comedy filled with paradoxical humor. For Brent and his wife Kendall (Selma Blair), stalking their sons Carly (Anne Winters) and Josh (Zackary Arthur) as they hole up in the basement is like a second honeymoon, and to explain why he bought a gun, Brent tells Kendall that “some psycho could break into the house. How am I supposed to defend us?”, blissfully oblivious to the fact that he's now the psychopath. And then there’s an exquisite turn of events in the third act, a kind of deus ex machina that actually makes perfect sense, involving a visit from Brent's parents, and including a fierce cameo by Lance Henriksen.

In the midst of all this chaos, the filmmakers manage, in the brief 83-minute runtime, to establish meaningful relationships among the main characters, especially in the opening scenes but also through the use of of well-placed flashbacks.",2022-08-27T05:42:51.991Z,6.0,Mom and Dad,2017

A buffet bar of high school kids on a bus returning from a basketball match are now in his sights. But an avenging father played by Ray Wise is willing to take the fight to the monster. 

It's a simple as it sounds, really. Creeper picks off various members of the bus, which is the usual array of annoyingly obnoxious teenagers.

""Jeepers Creepers 2"" (2003) is the best of the trilogy with the highlight being the creative and creepy monster, called the Creeper, which is reminiscent of the chief gargoyle in “Gargoyles” (1972), but more demonic and wholly evil. This is basically a confined location horror flick with the setting being the remote golden fields of Southern Cal (and the school bus).

The first film (2001) was hindered by its limited cast while this one tries to make up for it with a whole busload of kids and three school employees (two coaches and a bus driver). But the film generally drops the ball in the female department and, worse, focuses a little too much on shirtless jocks, which can be explained by the writer/director’s orientation (get real). There’s also zero depth; this is a movie about an evil winged creature that attacks a busload of youths and little else. But it’s very well done for what it is.

312669,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"A SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW www.screenzealots.com

In the latest indie to set itself out as an ‘intelligent’ alternative to the classic formulaic rom-com, “Maggie’s Plan” aims high, makes a strong effort, but sadly fails. It feels like another one of Woody Allen’s more cleverless films, one that has decent enough writing but struggles to elicit any genuine laughs.(This film is written and directed by Rebecca Miller, adapted from the original Karen Rinaldi story).

Everyone’s favorite quirky hipster actress, Greta Gerwig, is perfectly cast at the titular character. Her charming demeanor works and plays well off of Ethan Hawke, who turns in one of his best performances as a professor of ficto-critical anthropology (if you find his title hysterically funny then you, my friend, are the target audience for this movie), and Julianne Moore (as a brilliant yet cold Columbia professor). The cast gives it their all; too bad these actors don’t have a better script to work with.

This messy and uneven film can’t seem to make up its mind regarding the overall tone. It’s part screwball comedy, part hipster philosophy and part family dramedy. There’s a huge emphasis on a toddler (the admittedly cute Ida Rohatyn) that was lost on me as a non-parent. I think the kid stuff is just too much and is completely unnecessary to the story.

Maya Rudolph and Bill Hader are wasted in unremarkable supporting roles; their characters are never developed and seem to exist solely for a few punchlines (that aren’t very funny). There’s only a shell of a plot and not much ever happens in relation to it. The film is just a bunch of talking and a string of cute incidents that are all (sort of) related to Maggie’s big plan. The film is very strained and the big “twist” ending is something that only a true moron couldn’t see coming from a mile away.

Kind of a refreshing romance-drama on the cheating/divorce theme. Written and directed by Rebecca Miller. A great comeback after the six years of gap, but not a masterstroke. The casting was very impressive, particularly it was Greta Gerwig's typical film. I mean, if you enjoy watching her films, then you would do the same for it. On the other hand, her signature performance kind of bored to me. I mean all her film character was kind of easy-go-lucky soft-touch and comedic girl, I want her to try the different roles and genres. Maybe that's the reason many people had turned it down. Ethan Hawke and Julianne Moore were in the decent supporting roles, but everybody shared enough screen to call its their film too and delivered some good lines.

I had a good time with it, because it was better than I anticipated. The story was good and its entire narration they have developed it finely. Unfortunately, it is an R film, otherwise it could have been a film for all. Kind of it reminds us the Woody Allen's style of presentation. Because you know even in the tough times for film characters, they calm and coolly deals it. So that makes it is a stress free film, especially if you just had a bad day, it might help you cool down. But don't expect the loud laughs in the comedy parts, then you should not opt it.

The overall film is worth a watch, but don't believe those who are saying it is too bad. It might be bad for them, though definitely not bad to bash it top to bottom. The critics thumbed it up, and if you welcome decent films, then go for it and decide yourself. The film has lots of good qualities, but this could be the last film of Greta I'll be watching if she does not appear in a distinct role in her next, because like I said I already bored of her in the same old. Finally, I feel I want to suggest it, but not to everybody, particularly not the youngster, the grown ups might like it better.

A new age cinema. I don't know how it was put under 'found footage' subgenre film, since the webcams involved I think it is very much valid. There are lots of interesting stats for this like it is a $1m film, 80 minutes long, shot within the 16 days, but made to look like a single shot film in real time. This is a story of friends gang whose friend was recently committed suicide. Like usual one day, they are all hanging out on the Skype for a group chat, finds a stranger contact live among them who claims she's their dead friend. So the quest begins to find who really it is and what is the purpose behind such a pose.

This story is very familiar. Like a gang was put together in a room and revealing each others secret to bring total chaos. Take for example 'Cube'. What follows is we all know which is actually a famous cliché in a thriller like this. So I thought similar way for this and it was, but only in a digital format where the current world trend stands. So this film can be enjoyed by youngsters and those who are familiar which internet forums like facebook, skype, google, email et cetera. In the entire film, all you would see is the computer screen. So you have to quick where mousing is moving and text was composed and concentrating the audio comments. Something like sitting next to a friend's computer and looking what he's doing.

I think it was a good film, keeps us guessing till the final minute. I'm watching it a bit late, but very happy I did not miss it after all and there is already a second film getting ready which is due this year's end. But I doubt the film won't get anywhere near to this one. The franchise might end up like 'Paranormal Activity' if sequels keeping coming. The actors were good though. I thought one of them was Jennifer Carpenter where one of the film posters resembles 'Quarantine', but during the watch I realised it was a different actress.

Despite the familiar theme, the setting makes all the difference and pretty entertaining. The end scene was a surprise, because until that point I was not aware of this film genre. Definitely worth a watch for modernising the old storyline with lots of suspense.

Gabradze's direction is very intriguing. 'Unfriended' (lovingly renamed 'Mad Macs' by me) plays out in very simplistic fashion. The film shows the main character's computer screen throughout it's duration. The audience see every keystroke and mistake made by Blaire Lily (Shelley Hennig). This is a very compelling technique when trying to show the character's panic and fear slowly progressing. Blaire plays around with music software known as 'Spotify' during the film which gives an excuse for there to be non-diegetic music to add to the atmosphere.

As the film is mainly a conference video call on 'Skype', the actors are in separate rooms on individual ""webcams"" to add to the realism of the story. Although the film didn't require the actors each to connect to the internet, occasional screen buffering and flickering help add to the illusion.

'Unfriended' is a very dialogue-driven film as not a lot of action takes place. Therefore, it is essential to have a good screenplay to keep the story as intriguing as possible. The screenplay is solid and there are genuine moments when the mysterious stalker is very creepy and scary. Due to the nature of the film's themes, there is a lot of slang and computer terms that seasoned users of said social networking tools will appreciate and understand. If you are not very wise to how these programs work it may be hard to keep up with the story.

The actors weren't the best but the film did work. It would seem that their jarring and annoying demeanor added to the theme of the piece however.

Overall, 'Unfriended' is an interesting film. I thought it was a very clever statement on modern life. There were moments that were genuinely scary and creepy but like most modern horror films it relied too much on jump scares. It conjured up good memories of 'The Blair Witch Project' in how it tried to be as realistic as possible whilst also addressing dark themes of today's culture.

277685,Gimly,"Actually pretty alright, maybe the format has been utilised better elsewhere, but you still have to admire _Unfriended's_ dedication, especially for all the way back in 2014. That dedication does have some drawbacks though, the devotion to the realism unfortunately also means realistically low quality webcam video & audio, as well as the realistic wait times I've using a computer. It felt like for **so** much of _Unfriended_ I was just sitting there waiting for a page come up, or a file to download, or a response on an IM, and yes of course any computer user will absolutely have to wait for these things, but it's not what you go to the movies to see.

A group of online chat room friends find themselves terrorised by someone or something using the account of their dead friend. 

For someone like me who is way out of the age sphere for such things like the social media world featured here, Unfriended is a fascinating and unnerving experience. When your on line experiences are simply message boards and discussion forums etc, where twitter, skype, facebook and their like are alien to them, then one can only praise when an innovative and fresh idea is brought to the horror realm of film making. And lets face it, horror always needs new splinters to off set the ream of numerical sequels and remakes from hell.

Unfriended is not scary on conventional terms, where it's not about to jolt you out of your seat or have you hiding behind the sofa. It is, however, scary how technology has advanced, how the millions of world wide web users so willingly commit to baring their innermost to all and sundry. Then there's the dark half, those who use the platforms for venal and nefarious means, bringing very real terrors into our world. 

I can't personally vouch for how genuine the tech aspects are in this film, but Unfriended definitely taps into a frightening realm, and that is to be applauded.

277685,RalphRahal,"Unfriended is a movie that plays with a bold concept: telling the entire story through a computer screen. It’s an innovative approach that captures the modern digital experience, but it’s also limiting. The first act does a solid job setting up tension and showcasing realistic online interactions, but as the story transitions into supernatural horror, it loses some of its grounding. The ghost revenge angle feels less convincing, leaving the movie somewhere between a chilling cautionary tale and a far-fetched slasher.

The acting works well for what it is, especially if you see it as a revenge prank gone wrong. However, the supernatural elements don’t fully sell the scares. That said, the integration of music, complete with playlist visuals, is a clever and enjoyable touch. While Unfriended deserves credit for trying something different, it’s missing the depth needed to elevate it to a truly great horror film.

The central premise of a horror road trip, where the lead couple each believe the other party is the culprit (and are both wrong) is pretty solid, as is the final showdown, but the connective tissue is a bit wishy washy, and the inability to commit to a tone doesn't serve the movie very well, putting it at a lower point than any of its predecessors.

Dies hat sicherlich damit zu tun, dass zwischen den beiden Filmen 12 Jahre Filmgeschichte liegen und Horrorfilme in den 80er Jahren generell anders daher kamen als es noch 1974 der Fall war, doch irgendwie passt dieser humorvolle Ton nicht zu Leatherface und seiner degenerierten Familie. Irgendwie erwartete man ein heruntergekommenes Haus irgendwo in der Wüste und nicht einen eigenartigen Freizeitpark.

Tired of partying on Bourbon Street, a guy and his buddy (Joel David Moore and Deon Richmond) decide to take a night sightsee with other tourists at the alligator-infested bog, unaware of the dubious nature of the tour and the legend of a notorious hatchet man lurking the woods.

""Hatchet"" (2006) is a horror/comedy/spoof that combines the indoor swamp sets of “Man-Thing” (2005) with elements of the “Wrong Turn” or “Friday the 13th” franchises and the parody tone of “Club Dread” (2004). Regrettably, it’s the least of these. There’s nothing wrong with the cast or technical filmmaking as the gore, F/X and swamp sets are fine, although the ‘monster’ make-up looks kinda cartoonish (which fits the genre).

While it’s relatively amusing and occasionally funny, it’s hindered by an odious raunchy air right out of the gate. For instance, the two supposedly hot girls flash their breasts every 5 minutes in the first half hour. Don’t take that as prudish, I’m just pointing out that a movie is questionable when it goes overboard with female nudity to hide its deficiencies. Meanwhile the heroine played by Amara Zaragoza is interesting, but she has little sex appeal, although that’s a matter of taste.

I could handle those flaws if the story was more compelling and the humor more amusing, yet that’s not the case. Although the plot is great, the script needed a rewrite to flesh out better prospects. But that takes time & money and the flick only cost 1.5 million, which is almost six times LESS than what “Club Dread” cost.

I should add that Kane Hodder plays the Jason-like antagonist while Robert Englund has a cameo in the opening.     

The film runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, with a longer version running an additional 9 minutes. It was shot in New Orleans (Mardi Gras sequences) with the swamp scenes done in a convincing indoor set at Sable Ranch, Santa Clarita, California.

1683,The Movie Diorama,"The Reaping harvests souls of the religiously devoted by subjecting them to this. “What hath God wrought?”. If ever there was a tagline that would instantly persuade audiences to leap up from their sofas, drive to the nearest cinema complex and purchase a couple of tickets, it’s this one. Sure, using a phrase from the Book of Numbers (as opposed to Exodus which is the primary plot device of the film...) certainly sets the religiously inclined tone, that eventually dissolves into the plagued river of blood but more on that later. It also indicates the unimaginative stupidity that ensues, leaving logic and science behind for a faith-based apocalyptic tale that is in need of some serious stoning. A professor in debunking miracles is invited to investigate a “river of blood” in the nearby town of Haven, but is quickly ensnared in an apocalyptic mystery.

Whilst not the worst horror film in the existence of cinema, with a tepid schlocky tone that somewhat juxtaposes the devoted Christian ideologies presented, yet is so inexplicably dumb that it will leave you questioning why such a film was created in the first place. Its initial introduction commenced with much promise. Science against religion. Simple logical explanations explaining what many describe as religious miracles. Yes, it’s relatively on the nose and misses the point of acquiring faith, yet remained an interesting direction for the first half that managed to conjure up various problematic conversations.

Hot off her Oscar win, swanky Swank muddles through this unusual mystery with much trepidation, choosing not to believe that the plagues of Egypt condemning Haven are in fact coincidental, offering scientific explanations. Algae bloom for the “blood river” that has the consistency of red-dyed water (sorry not sorry...). Infections terminating frogs, that is never explained how they fell from the sky, but whatever. Flies consuming the flesh of the frogs, and you get the idea. She remains unconvinced throughout these biblical mishaps, and provides an interesting angle.

Well, that is until about halfway through when she switches from being Bill Nye the Science Guy to Pope Francis of the Vatican. Suddenly she has faith, despite her tragic backstory clumsily spliced with the main plot, and holy reaping balls do events get crazy. CGI locust infestation, satanic cult crazes and a thunderstorm of fire that incinerates life in a matter of seconds. It went from a minor science experiment to absolute chaos, quicker than a snap of your fingers. The change of pace is so jarring and bewildering, that when the predictably obtuse third act arrives you’re stunned into silence. The tantalising debunking approach now plagued by, well, the plagues. The mystery is ham-fisted and makes no sense whatsoever. Constant flashbacks providing clues, more like clear answers mind you, were choppy and fragmented. It’s not scary in the slightest. Main characters are expended and forgotten about almost instantly, a shame considering Elba was decent as always. And what’s Rea’s purpose in this? No seriously. Except for providing basic exposition, he seemed pointless in this endeavour.

A very minuscule part of my soul wants to like this for being the barking mad mystery that it is. To an extent, it is watchable if you know to turn your brain off and devour all the spiel on religious provocations, despite the interesting first act. It has this surreal allure, making each watch tolerable. But then I think back to the last thirty minutes and I then really want to experience all ten plagues for myself. Incomprehensibly ludicrous.

1683,Wuchak,"_**Intriguing first act gives way to dull second act, but decent ending**_

Released in 2007, ""The Reaping"" is a about a former ordained missionary who's now a professor who debunks supposed miracles around the world (Hilary Swank). She and her assistant (Idris Elba) venture to a bayou town where, amazingly, the ten plagues of Exodus are manifesting (!). David Morrissey plays their host in the town while AnnaSophia Robb plays the 12 year-old focal point of the plagues. Are the plagues real or can they be scientifically explained? If they're real, who's the source, God or the devil?

This is a haunting mystery horror film rather than a monster/slasher movie, so if you're looking for the latter don't bother. That said, this is an extremely well-made production. The visuals of the various plagues are awesome, particularly the bayou turning to blood, the locusts and fire raining from the sky. Moreover, Swank looks super sharp in the manner of Raquel Welch (neither are my type, but who can deny their looks that kill?). Elba is a likable partner and Morrissey seems creepy from the get-go. As for AnnaSophia, it's clear even at 12 years of age that she was gonna morph into a curvy cutie.

Where the movie goes wrong are elements of the story/script. It starts out good and is intriguing for the first 45 minutes or so, but then the next 30 minutes seriously lag. When the plot twist is revealed in the last act it turned me off the first time I watched the film, but I was braced for it with my second viewing and was able to accept it. The ending, while cartoonish, is spectacular in the manner of the end of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" So this is a solid mystery/horror movie, but it could've been better if they worked out the kinks in the screenplay, like the draggy second act and unsavory plot twist.

The film runs 99 minutes and was shot in St. Francisville, Louisiana (the bayou town), Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Shreveport & New Orleans, Louisiana, as well as San Juan, Porta Rico (the opening sequence) and Austin Texas.

Run from a budget of $24M the film has almost no actors of note in lead roles. Although there is a cameo from Eli Roth (_Inglourious Basterds_), which is always cool.

What we have here, is a virtually flawless example of stupid fun. There's no point in trying to evaluate a film like _Piranha 3D_ on factors like good taste, because it goes out of its way to smash these conventions apart. The film has this crazy energy about it from beginning to end.

It also however, is the perfect example of why 3D is so fucking unnecessary. And though I appreciate how forward the film is, that doesn't make it strictly speaking good. It's part creature-feature, part horror-comedy, but it doesn't stand up in a thrill sense to actual monster movies like _Anaconda_ or _King Kong_, and it doesn't stand up in a humour sense to actual horror comedy like _Shaun of the Dead_ or _Dead Snow_, but it sort of takes off on its own in a passable manner. Though it's kiiinda humorous, the film is mostly just ""fun"", as opposed to ""funny"".

The script seems cobbled together with a couple of different half assed plot points, but several half ass plots taped together is better than just one half assed plot trying to hold its own and ending up looking like no plot at all. Exploitation has never really been A-grade material, and even though the ""suspension of disbelief"" thing that films are supposed to have as a general rule, is sort of... not here, _Piranha 3D_ still manages to somehow get this piece of crap off the ground.

I watched it at about 2am with a male friend of mine who has very similar taste and sense of humour to me, and that's pretty much got to be the best possible setting to watch it in. The CG gore is ridiculous, the 3D focus is ridiculous, the film itself is just fucking ridiculous. But brainless is great sometimes, just don't make a habit of thinking that you can get away with bad exploitation, and calling it Black Comedy, once or twice is fine, but soon it just looks like you're aiming for cult, and getting lazy.

Actually many of today's younger multiplex goers hunt in packs, they know what they like and they know how to have a good time with even the most crude or banal movie. I don't mean that as an insult, it's just indicative of the film market available to them, it's the reason why films like this here Piranha remake/re-imaging/re-jig exists and makes money.

Alexandre Aja's Piranha 3D is a complete machine gun of a movie, it knew exactly how to sell tickets at the box office.

43593,tmdb28039023,"In 1975, Richard Dreyfuss starred in Jaws; 35 years later he had a cameo in Piranha. His connection to the first film is obviously the only reason he’s in the second, wherein he’s killed off before his name even appears in the opening credits. 

Dreyfuss is not alone, though; Elisabeth Shue and Ving Rhames also get to whore themselves out. In the latter's case, there was never any danger that Piranha would result in another hand-me-down acting award for Jack Lemmon; on the other hand, Rhames has easily the best scene in the entire movie — using an outboard motor in a way that would make Ash Williams proud. 

But I'm getting ahead of myself; Shue and Rhames first have to find the remains of Dreyfuss, then capture a piranha which they take to Christopher Lloyd (in full Doc Brown mode), who identifies it as a species that has been extinct for two million years (according to the subtitles, Lloyd calls it the ""regional piranha,"" but he may actually be saying ""original""; either way it doesn’t matter because neither term makes sense). 

An earthquake released the piranhas from an underground lake, or some such bullshit. Q: ""How could they survive for so long cut off from the surface?"" A: ""Cannibalism. They must have fought each other to survive.” Until, presumably, there could be only one. Piranha MacLeod? Well, that would actually explain their apparent immortality.

Piranha is supposed to be a comedy — or, specifically, it's a remake of a parody of Jaws released three years after Jaws and 32 before this one. In other words, this material was so diluted it was almost homeopathic. 

Shue and Rhames are big fish in a small pond here — kinda like those poor Sea World orcas (I know they’re mammals; you get the idea, though); as such, the only emotion they inspire in the audience is pity over their career choices. 

Only Jerry O'Connell, in a role no doubt based on Joe Francis (of Girls Gone Wild infamy), moves as if he's in his own element — ​​because he is; he knows exactly, having been in several others of the same ilk, what kind of movie this is, and navigates it accordingly.",2022-09-16T03:00:49.626Z,1.0,Piranha 3D,2010

It isn't as concise or as fun as Joe Dante's flick, the effects aren't the most convincing either.

The 3D portions are funny to see all these years later (in 2D, obvs). I was never a fan of that format, so I'm glad it never stuck around - pure gimmick. Going back to the effects, the piranha's usage and design underwhelm. I also said this in my review of the 1978 flick's sequel, but: less is more.

The cast are alright. Elisabeth Shue is the clear standout, her character is actually quite cool in terms of what she does and how she handles herself; not a female character that is only there for their looks, like most are here to be frank. Elsewhere, Steven R. McQueen is solid too.

Interesting to see the involvement of Kelly Brook, someone I know from her work away from film; smart casting, to be fair. Away from those, Jessica Szohr is decent, though Jerry O'Connell is rubbish. Adam Scott, Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd also appear, Richard Dreyfuss too.

This film certainly falls into the latter category, but that's about the only thing it does right. Everything else, from writing to acting is an unbelievably cringey misfire, that manages to offend and belittle every demographic, in nearly equal doses. This isn't a film for right-wingers, and though it tries to be, it's not one for the left either. It's simply a catastrophic mess, that takes one of the most basic premises in horror history, and tries to use it for social commentary. I'm all well and good with politics in my cinema, even horror, and I'm a very left-leaning individual, but there's a way to imbue progressive values in a film, and a way not to. This is a masterclass on how not to.

The basics for a decent horror flick were here. At it's core, the film's bones are still very much structured after the backwoods horror that inspired the original ""Wrong Turn"". Where this film differs is in it's treatment of the hillbillies themselves. There's no slobbering, deformed monster-men here. Instead, we're given a cult-like group, with a very nomadic culture. Supposedly the ancestors of a group that headed into the mountains during the Civil War, and intended to create a free, equal society based on primitivism. The film's horror elements are decent, especially the variety of deadly hunting traps littering the forest for wayward travelers to stumble into. These moments provide some memorable, sometimes shocking set-pieces, but that's the only positive beyond decent enough direction.

Where the film goes wrong is in it's socio-political tones. Backwoods horror has long commented on the disparity between rural peoples and so-called ""city slickers"", but this film is overbearing in the heavy-handedness it uses to drive home this point, with the subtlety of a sledge hammer. The main characters are a group of clichés, each meant to tick off a minority status. I want to make it clear, I'm not saying that from a reactionary point of view, the characterizations are simply insulting and the dialogue sounds as if it was written by a bratty child. The characters are needlessly and viciously antagonistic to the rural peoples, before they even get on the mountain. Once they do reach the mountain, the film's ""clever twist"" becomes quickly apparent. Not long after the group begins wandering into the traps, it becomes apparent that the mountain dwellers are not trying to kill them. These kids are simply setting off hunting traps by being off the beaten path, but when they see the fiercely dressed cultists, speaking tongues, they assume they are in danger and thus attack. This is the film's un-subtle commentary on society's tendency to misunderstand other cultures and pre-judge based on appearance.

All would be well and good, except that the cult themselves are no better than these bougie, ignorant city kids. They deal out their own twisted brand of ""an eye for an eye"" justice, and turn out to be nothing more than a hyper-traditionalist group of rapists, that may not be as benign as the film paints them in the middle segment. Still, there's hardly anyone to root for. It quickly becomes apparent that the cult are nothing but barbaric heathens, but the kids make so many poor choices and intentionally provoke violence instead of being mature adults. The film unironically could have ended well for everyone if certain characters had kept their mouths shut, but this is one of those scripts in which the entire plot hinges on everyone being as vapid as possible. In the end, despite it's pretensions to say something progressive, it ends up painting both left, right and everything in between as idiocy. Couple this with dialogue so poor that it evokes laughter, and this is a bizarre effort that I can't believe ever saw wide release. We can only hope this train-wreck doesn't somehow inspire a slew of increasingly lousy sequels as the original film did. Because this one already set the bar as low as possible.",2021-03-29T20:56:11.026Z,,Wrong Turn,2021

This has very little to do with the original other than weird people hunting people in the woods.

This movie surprised me quite a bit, I just didn't expect it to take the story form that it did.  The cast all did a great job, and the story is well written in layers.

The movie also does something I've noticed some movies have been doing somewhat recently where the movie ends, but continues with what feels like a new story, related to the first.  Other movies have done this (though much more sloppily) in the past, but I feel like writers have started to do this on purpose, to very good effect.

The movie is good at keeping the audience in the dark to what is going on, and being brutal with the characters in rather interesting ways.

13207,tmdb17996075,"'Friday the 13th' turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments when it comes to horror classics remakes. After watching the trailers, I got the wrong idea that this film was going to be more serious. The previews gave me the false impression that this remake was going to go deeper into Jason's background story or maybe even offer extremely gory murders, when in reality, it is exactly the opposite. I'm not one of those horror lovers who want to know everything related to the villains, their origins and such, but in this case, it would have been acceptable to throw in some flashbacks regarding Jason Voorhees' past. Unfortunately, this remake wastes all the opportunities to make this interesting and instead, it offers an exaggerated and ineffective amount of comedy situations that are badly placed and ruin the possibility of creating a genuine horror feeling. Comedy situations in slasher films are no surprise, but in this remake, the attempted comedy is badly placed and seems like it was forced by the producers to make the film more marketable. I will give an example: after a really tense and dramatic persecution, the film cuts to a scene involving a horny stereotyped hillbilly lusting over a mannequin, while Jason silently walking up to him from behind, with the obvious intention of slashing him. How can they mix cheap humor and tension in one scene? The results obviously cannot be good. It was a murder scene, but instead of causing uneasiness, tension or shock, everyone at the movie theater was laughing at the guy talking about how he lost his virginity to a mannequin. The worst part is that the so-called humor is extremely 15-years-ago and even back then, it wouldn't have been funny.

The gore is very unsatisfying also. Nowadays, slasher films usually offer creative and really brutal murders and even if the plot is not so good, you can always at least settle for that. When I found out that Marcus Nispel was directing this, I thought it was good news, because he directed ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" remake, which is a fine example of a movie that may not be as good as the original, but at least it offers something more serious, gory and overall fulfilling. Naturally, since Marcus Nispel also directed 'Friday the 13th' remake, I expected something in the same vein as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' remake. Sadly, that was a very inaccurate assumption. In this film, the gore is completely unsatisfactory and in some cases, the murders are even funny. The entire movie theater burst into a maniacal laughter during some of the murders and I must say that in those cases, I had to agree with them.

Another thing that bothered me about this film, is the fact that they could have showed a little bit more about the character of Mrs. Voorhees. Unfortunately, she only appears during the first seconds of the film and they cut her scenes with the opening credits, which is a disgrace. The confrontation between Mrs. Voorhees and the counselor girl is perhaps one of the finest points of the entire 'Friday the 13th' series, and it should have been remade in an equally tense way. Cutting the scene with the opening credits is, in my opinion, a self-sabotage. I think it's safe to say that many fans of the original film were eager to learn some more about Jason's beloved mother and see her more time on the screen. But no... apparently, they didn't even take advantage of that opportunity to make this movie more interesting. True, we see a little bit about Jason's environment, since the characters get to take a tour inside his house and it was a good idea to show his bedroom and evidence the fact that once upon a time, the killing machine was an innocent boy with a normal life. However, that doesn't make up for the lack of space that Mrs. Voorhees had on the story.

'Friday the 13th' turned out to be a teen comedy with lousy humor and some badly placed murders from the beginning until the end. Watch it if you're curious, but unless you're a silly teenager who thinks everything is funny, don't expect anything even remotely good, because you'll be devastated.",2017-02-14T00:23:49.253Z,4.0,Friday the 13th,2009
13207,Wuchak,"***Scarier and with a more dangerous Jason, but not as fun***

I became a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" series after seeing ""Part V: A New Beginning"" (1985) on TV in the late 90s and have subsequently digested all of the films in the series. This '09 reboot takes elements of the first four films, drops all campy elements seen in Part III (and V, VI, IX & X) and provides better scares with a more dangerous Jason, who runs, shoots arrows, uses traps and schemes. In the original series Jason was comparable to an unstoppable zombie-like force, particularly as the series progressed where Jason became more & more infernal and monstrous. Here he's more human, which makes sense since it's early in the timeline and Jason hasn't yet morphed into the hellish zombie he became in later segments.

The appeal of the series for is not the gore or kills but rather the plot of a group of youths gathering in the wilderness; the inclusion of a psycho killer on the loose adds a necessary element of threat & suspense, and Jason's a quality nemesis/monster. Simply put, ""Friday the 13th"" is an entertaining series with creepy elements, but I never found the flicks all that scary, not even the first two films, which are the most serious in tone, along with IV, VII, VIII and XI. Of course there are jump-scares galore, but that's not what I'm talking about. With the third installment, campiness was added, which made several of the installments even less scary. The good thing about this '09 reboot is that it throws out the campy aspects and opts for a more serious approach. In addition, it has a couple of sequences that produce actual frights, something I never experienced with the rest of the series, as well as scenes with genuine suspense, like when Jason chases the three protagonists through the tunnels, etc.

Speaking of the three protagonists, the cast is filled with youthful no-names, but the three main protagonists, a brother & sister and a brunette who takes a liking to the brother, are good and likable. It's always nice to have some people you can root for. Really, there are only two characters who are unlikable, a creepy redneck hick (and his ""hot"" mannequin, lol) and the arrogant alpha-male whose father owns the vacation house.

I found one aspect of the film highly unusual and unique. I'm referring to the 24-minute prologue before the opening credits. This has to be one of the longest prologues in film history. I have to give credit to the filmmakers for being creative and trying something different.

This reboot also just plain LOOKS better than all those older films; I'm referring mostly to the creepy woods at night. This is to be expected, of course, with the advancements in filming technology since 1980, not to mention the bigger budget.

The series is known for its excellent assortment of women in every entry, but this one's not quite as good as most of the films in the franchise. There's the excellent Amanda (America Olivo) in the first act and also Whitney (Amanda Righetti) and Jenna (Danielle Panabaker) as the two female protagonists. They're solid, but not in the same league as Pam in Part V, Agent Marcus in Part IX and Heather in Part XI (FvJ). I suppose it's all a matter of taste though. 

The film was shot in the heart of Texas, mainly in regions relatively near Austin.

FINAL WORD: My biggest criteria for judging the worth of a film is whether or not it pulls me in and makes me forget about the passing of time. This '09 reboot succeeds in this respect. Although nothing can replace the initial 1980 film and its immediate sequel, this reboot should be given credit for generating a few genuine scares, which I rarely if ever experienced with the rest of the series; not to mention providing a worthy trio of protagonists, as well as scenes with genuine momentum. 

Other than these factors, the reboot is just more of the same, but it's at least as good as the better sequels, although it's not as fun as several of them because it shoots for serious horror. This is good, but the first half is more effective than the second. And it fails to approach the greatness of the '09 remake of ""The Last House on the Left,"" a veritable masterpiece that transcends the usual one-dimensional nature of most slasher flicks, not that I would expect (or necessarily want) that for ""Friday the 13th."" 

I have the ""Killer Cut"" that runs 105 minutes, while the theatrical version runs 97 minutes. Needless to say, this is a heavy R-rated picture.

13207,Gimly,"**The following is a long-form review that I originally wrote in 2009.**

_Friday the 13th_, originally released in 1980 began one of the most successful film franchises of all time. Now, 31 years later, the newest incarnation of _Friday the 13th_ has just been released on Special Edition DVD. It seems unlikely that the director of the first film Sean S. Cunningham (who is also the producer of the 2009 version) could ever have seen just where the monster he had helped to create would go. So now, with the series being given one of those oh-so-popular of late ""reboots"", it's important to take a look at what Jason Voorhees has been up to, what has changed, and just as importantly, what hasn't.

The film loosely follows the progression of the first four _Friday the 13th_ films, the opening credit sequence has mother dearest Pamela Voorhees on June 13, 1980 confronting one of the Camp Crystal Lake counsellors , she is promptly decapitated with a machete, as per the original story. This is a powerful intro to the rest of the movie, as a reboot, you have to show Mrs. Voorhees at some point in time, but it can't take up too many of those valuable 90 minutes. At this point the film begins to deviate from the original, we get some of Harry Manfredini's musical score (Ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma) but this time round Jason is very much alive, sees his mother beheaded and picks up his iconic machete and some very bad habits from here on in. After the credits there is a new bunch of kids, looking to score some pot, have a little pre-marital sex, get wasted, go places they're not allowed, and just generally set themselves up to die. But something is missing... that would be... Oh yes, the cast! Only a single member of the ""media-hyped"" actors portrays a character in this group, so we already know that these guys are going nowhere. Only after their demise are we given the ""_FRIDAY THE 13TH_"" movie title, and the film begins. Unfortunately, by the time this happens, we have already been through a good set of characters, and it feels like watching a sequel after you're 23 minutes in.

The new group of rowdy teenagers have much the same plans in store as the last, but they are much less believable characters when compared to the ones we had just minutes ago. They are somewhat saved by the performances of Travis Van Winkle (from _Accepted_) as Trent, the ""rich asshole"" of the movie, and Aaron Yoo as Chewie, the lovable little stoner. Jared Padalecki's character Clay (a reboot of Rob from _Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter_) is wholly out of place, maybe it's his _Supernatural_ fame or maybe it's his deliberate intention to not have a good time. Either way the protagonist of the entire film really doesn't seem like he belongs in the movie at all. Sort of a down point when you think about it.

While the film didn't seem to have plot holes per se, it very much seems as though they tried to fit the creation of the film in before it was due to be released on Friday, February 13th. Now don't get me wrong, I love novelty and a good theatrical gimmick as much as anyone can, but know what I care about even more? The end product (especially when it comes to _Friday the 13th_)! The time could have been much better spent on filling in all the little bits where the movie just seemed to be missing something. You're not quite sure what it is, but that's their job to figure out.

The hype over the film's sexual content seems to have been grossly over-exaggerated. Supposedly Michael Bay walked out of the first screening due to the sex scenes. After having watched the film, I find this very difficult to believe. Although the sex does seem to have been thrown in for the Hell of it (isn't it always), there really isn't all that much. But, after all of the problems the film goes through, they get the most important thing right, Jason. With culturally recognised hockey mask and machete in tow, Mr. Voorhees does his thing, and he does it well. Whilst this particular incarnation of Jason is wholly more believable than any of the others, Derek Mears makes it work, he's not a supernatural boogieman-esque killing machine, he's a hunter, he's a natural, he's almost the anti-hero. Upon first hearing that Kane Hodder was yet again not to be playing the role of Jason Voorhees, I think a little part of me died inside. But I submit, Derek Mears has given the best representation of Jason I think we've ever seen.

The 2009 reboot of _Friday the 13th_ is the type of movie that you can watch, and when it's finished, want to go right back to the beginning and watch it all over again, you're just not sure why...

643586,Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,"As it goes in the film world, there will be plenty of critics who will think they are “too good” for a ridiculous movie like “Willy’s Wonderland,” an outrageous, audience-pleasing popcorn flick with an 80s slasher vibe. This film is one that feels like it’s made expressly for fans of the horror-comedy genre, and its terrific premise, badass hero, and throwback grindhouse sentiment check all the boxes for a successful journey to becoming a midnight cult classic.

A quiet loner (Nicolas Cage) becomes stranded in a remote town when his car breaks down. Unable to pay for the needed repairs, he agrees to spend the night cleaning up the local abandoned family fun center known as Willy’s Wonderland. Little does he know that he has just signed up to be the janitor for a place believed to be haunted. Things haven’t been the same since the rumors about missing children (and evil animatronics) took over the town. As the night progresses, the man discovers that the life-sized fuzzy mascots have minds of their own, and he must fight to the death in order to survive to see the sun rise.

The story is solid all around and if you suspend disbelief, the plot is actually plausible. There are supernatural elements and lots of humor, and the Janitor is the horror hero we didn’t know we needed. Kevin Lewis has a terrific eye for direction, a natural at knowing exactly what the audience wants to see and how they want to see it (and delivering just that). The pacing is excellent, too. The film ends with a set-up for an eventual sequel that I really, really hope happens.

The most appropriate word I can find to describe this movie, and one that fits in almost any discussion of the film, is “rad.” The awesome, primitive puppet costumes for Willy the Weasel and his tribe of murderous pals (Tito the Turtle, Siren Sara, Ozzie the Ostrich, and Knighty Knight, to name a few) are absolutely hysterical, the perfect pair for the equally amusing low budget horror effects. Even better is Cage, who brings that certain je ne sais quoi to his character, a soda-guzzling, pinball-loving man of few words (the actor doesn’t speak any dialogue in the movie).

This isn’t a movie that you’re supposed to take seriously, and that’s what adds to its charm. “Willy’s Wonderland” is tons of bloody fun, especially if you want to watch Nic Cage beat the shit out of possessed serial killer animatronics.

643586,tmdb51616167,"""Willy's Wonderland"" is a film that draws parallels to the popular video game series ""Five Nights at Freddy's,"" despite being an original creation. Starring Nicolas Cage, who may not typically be your preferred actor, the movie showcases his silent yet captivating portrayal, adding to the unique charm of the film. The creativity behind the monstrous characters and Cage's character's silent approach to combating them contributes to the film's appeal, making it an enjoyable viewing experience.

The group of characters introduced in the film adds depth and creativity to the story, serving as victims to Cage's character's relentless mission to defeat the murderous creatures. While their presence enhances the narrative, their survival is not essential, adding to the suspense and tension throughout the movie.

The unexpected twist involving the cop and others deciding to strike a deal with the creatures rather than destroying the building adds a layer of intrigue to the storyline. While the decision may seem unconventional, it contributes to the overall atmosphere of the film and keeps viewers engaged in the unfolding events.

I would've liked a bit more progression in the story, as this very much feels like the middle entry in a three-parter.

This flick gives more screen time to those around Jamie Lee Curtis, which isn't necessarily a positive (given Curtis is as good as she is) but the actors all do find jobs - even if no-one particularly stands out, at least to me. Away from the cast, the deaths are solid and the use of the iconic theme is spot on.

A little better than its garbage reputation, as evidence by the support it got at the box office from its target audience, Mark Tonderai’s horror/thriller is safe genre film making. There’s no intelligence in the screenplay, no copious amounts of blood letting, the characters do dumb things and in truth it unfolds as a standard girl in peril movie. These things are what have led to it being savaged by critics, but backed by a trio of strong performances from Jennifer Lawrence, Elisabeth Shue and Max Thieriot, boosted by a genuine narrative surprise and the fact that Tonderai is able to do the peril motifs with suspenseful impact, ensures House at the End of the Street is at least a decent enough time waster. 5/10",2014-06-29T12:51:09.975Z,5.0,House at the End of the Street,2012

A mother and daughter (Elisabeth Shue & Jennifer Lawrence) move into a Pennsylvania suburb where a nearby abode was the scene of a double murder four years earlier, committed by a deranged girl named Carrie-Anne. She was thought to have drowned, but her body was never found and local legend suggests that she prowls the eerie woods. Meanwhile her brooding brother (Max Thieriot) lives on the property and is maltreated by some of the residents. Gil Bellows plays an officer that befriends the mother and is sympathetic toward the despondent young man.   

“House at the End of the Street” (2012) is a coming-of-age drama mixed with mystery and horror of the slasher variety, but more realistic than a guy in a mask lurking around with a machete. It borrows story elements from “Psycho” (1960) and “Sleepaway Camp” (1983), but has the polished modern tone of flicks like “Solstice” (2008), “The Last House on the Left” (2009) and “My Soul to Take” (2010). It’s not great like “Psycho” or the remake of “Last House,” but it’s at least on par with “Solstice” and superior to “Sleepaway Camp” and “My Soul to Take.”   

Jennifer looks great in her prime while Thieriot’s character makes for a sympathetic study. The lush Eastern locations are sumptuous and the relatively believable story holds your interest while offering some unexpected revelations. The feminine cast also includes Allie MacDonald, Eva Link and Jordan Hayes.

The film runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in Metcalfe & Carp, Ontario, both outside of Ottawa.

>_I think of the film as a comedy, very much so. It's not agitprop. It definitely has a sociopolitical thread in it, which is reflective and therefore dark. But hey, everyone, wake up! We're in the sixth mass extinction on this planet. To not have that darkness would have been a little superficial. There is a sadness in human behaviour for me, and zombies are the most obvious metaphor you could employ. We were also trying to make a kind of extension or homage to George Romero because of his postmodern reinvention of zombies, and those sociopolitical threads are evident in his films. Romero does a lot of fascinating things. The zombies are monsters, but they're not Godzilla. They don't come from outside the social order. They come from within a collapsing social order. They're us, or any of us who have died, so they are also victims because they don't choose to be undead. It's because of some stupid shit humans did that caused them to become undead. The problems of mass consumerism, the things that are woven into Romero's films, have only gotten worse. They haven't changed. We're at a crisis because of what his films were warning. And now we're at the endgame of that. What is more terrifying than having 1 million species going extinct in the last decade?_

- Jim Jarmusch; ""Jim Jarmusch Believes in the Teens, But Not Joe Biden"" (Bilge Ebiri); _Vulture_ (June 17, 2019)

_The Dead Don't Die_ is such an unexpected film that when the trailer first dropped, a lot of people assumed it to be a joke of some kind; that the film purportedly being advertised couldn't possibly be real. And there's a good reason for that, as who could have predicted that celebrated indie writer/director Jim Jarmusch would have any interest in making an ensemble zombie comedy? Well, the thing about that is that, as it turns out, he doesn't. Jarmusch has certainly made genre films in the past – _Down By Law_ (1986) is a prison break film, _Dead Man_ (1995) is a western, _Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai_ (1999) is a samurai film, _The Limits of Control_ (2009) is the story of an assassin, _Only Lovers Left Alive _(2013) is about vampires. Usually, he is exceptionally successful at grafting his worldview onto the generic tropes, often to such an extent that it can be difficult to separate the two – these films are undeniably genre pieces, but so too are they undeniably Jim Jarmusch films. With _The Dead Don't Die_, however, he's not quite as successful; this is very much a Jarmusch film before it's a zombie movie, with these two components often rubbing awkwardly up against one another.

Unexpectedly chosen as the opening film at Cannes 2019, the film has met with mixed responses from both critics and audiences, and it's not hard to see why – glib socio-political commentary is introduced without really going anywhere; heavily promoted performers have nothing more than one or two-scene cameos; some of the characters know they're in a movie, even referring to Jarmusch himself, whilst others do not; a lot of the humour is of the flippant self-congratulatory kind; things become very preachy towards the end as Jarmusch abandons all semblance of narrative progression and shifts gears into a pseudo-TED talk. However, for all that, I enjoyed it. A zombie apocalypse movie set very much in Trump's America, it embraces all the weirdness that such a scenario suggests; the awkward humour works well for the most part, the meta elements are intriguing but not too distracting, and as for the didacticism? Well, nothing that Jarmusch says is incorrect; we _are_ a culture ruled by materialism and we _are_ sticking our collective heads in the sand regarding the fact that we're destroying the only home we have. So it might be inelegant (and Jarmusch has never been a satirist of Swiftian pedigree), but it's not wrong.

Set in the fictional town of Centerville (pop. 738), the film begins as Chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray) and Officer Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) are following up a complaint from farmer Frank Miller (Steve Buscemi), who claims that a local vagrant, Hermit Bob (Tom Waits), has stolen one of his chickens. Issuing Bob with a warning, the duo are returning to the station when they realise that despite it being 8pm, the sun is still shining brightly, also noticing that their watches have stopped and they can't get any signal on their phones. Meanwhile, at the local diner, Frank and hardware store owner Hank Thompson (Danny Glover) watch a news report about recent ""polar fracking"", which some believe has knocked the earth off its axis. Returning to the police station, Cliff and Ronnie discuss the situation with Officer Mindy Morrison (Chloë Sevigny), also talking about the town's strange new undertaker, Zelda Winston (Tilda Swinton), a white-haired Scottish woman with a collection of samurai swords and a statue of Buddha. Ronnie and Mindy head home for the night, leaving Cliff with the body of Mallory O'Brien (Carol Kane), a local drunk who recently died. As the sun finally sets on Centerville, however, two zombies (Sara Driver and Iggy Pop) rise from the dead and set out in pursuit of the one thing all zombies crave...eh, coffee. 

Very much an ensemble piece, aside from the above characters, we're also introduced to a litany of additional Centerville residents - diner waitress Fern (Eszter Balint); detainees at a juvenile detention facility Stella (Maya Delmont), Olivia (Taliyah Whitaker), and Geronimo (Jahi Di'Allo Winston); gas station owner Bobby Wiggins (Caleb Landry Jones); delivery man Dean (RZA); motel owner Danny Perkins (Larry Fessenden); journalist Posie Juarez (Rosie Perez); cleaner Lily (Rosal Colon); and out-of-towners Zoe (Selena Gomez), Jack (Austin Butler) and Zack (Luka Sabbat).

If _The Dead Don't Die_ has a salient theme, it's apathy, suggesting that humanity is sleepwalking its way towards its own extinction. The zombie apocalypse is depicted as initially slow and distant, not something about which to be overly concerned, until, without us realising how it has happened, there's no escape or chance of salvation. In this sense, Jarmusch uses zombies as double signifiers – they not only represent the apocalypse towards which we are moving, they also represent us, indifferently shuffling our way to an oblivion we know is coming, but which we choose to ignore (at one point, Cliff literally falls into an open grave because he isn't looking where he's going). Targeting rampant materialism, capitalist greed, and moral idiocy in elected officials, the film does provide a narrative explanation for why the dead are rising from the grave (the oft-discussed polar fracking), but really, Jarmusch isn't as interested in the ""why"" as he is in the ""how"", castigating a moribund and materialist society which has become blind to everything but trivial consumerist gratification.

In short, Jarmusch is suggesting that as a society, we've become zombified; lazy, instinctual, addicted to things that don't matter (whilst the first zombies we meet want coffee, others are on the hunt for WiFi, Siri, Chardonnay, Xanax, and ""Fashion""). Indeed, in this sense, one of the film's more subtle (and interesting) points is that the best way to remain outside such societal calcification is to avoid conformism and remain on the edges of the social contract – the characters who do best against the zombies are the socially ostracised Zelda, the three kids in the detention centre, and the philosophical Hermit Bob, who suggests that ""_hunger for more stuff_"" has become society's primary motivator. Indeed, the way most of the characters react to the zombies is itself part of the critique – the vast majority respond in a blasé manner, suggesting that in these insane times, when so many people are falling all over themselves to normalise the rantings of the racist, misogynistic, incoherent manchild in the Oval Office, even something like the dead rising from the ground is no big deal.

Of course, using zombies as vehicles for social satire isn't exactly new; George A. Romero did it as far back as _Night of the Living Dead_ (1968), which is more about endemic racism than zombies. He did it to even greater effect in _Dawn of the Dead_ (1978), where he targeted materialistic vapidity. Later, he looked at issues such as Reagan-era militarism in _Day of the Dead_ (1985), economic disparity in _Land of the Dead_ (2005), media impartiality in _Diary of the Dead_ (2007), and tribalism in _Survival of the Dead_ (2009). In this tradition, _The Dead Don't Die_ has its eye very much on the climate change-denying administration in Washington; Frank is introduced wearing a MAGA-style baseball cap with a ""Keep America White Again"" logo, whilst his dog is called Rumsfeld. Indeed, Centerville itself is very much a quintessential Heartland town, the kind where Trump so successfully mobilised his blue collar base. And whilst it remains a comedy, much of what _The Dead Don't Die_ says is deadly serious – the current xenophobic American government is incompetent to an almost surrealistic degree; facts are no longer considered irrefutable, vying for space with blatant lies, amidst paranoid accusations of ""Fake News""; the planet _is_ dying; the polar ice caps _are_ melting, and with them, the future of our species; universal scientific guarantees of impending extinction _are_ largely ignored, whilst the idiots in power discard the warnings of their own people, strip away environmental protections, and continually confuse weather and climate.

One element of the film that's especially interesting is the Pirandellian self-reflexivity, with some of the characters aware that they're in a movie, but the rest seemingly oblivious. For example, the opening credits are scored to Sturgill Simpson's ""The Dead Don't Die"", and only a few minutes later, the song begins playing on the radio in Cliff and Ronnie's car. When Cliff asks why the song sounds so familiar, Ronnie explains that it's probably because ""_it's the theme song_"". In another scene, Ronnie is shown wearing a _Star Wars_ key-ring, alluding to his portrayal of Kylo Ren in that franchise. Later, after Ronnie has declared about a million times that ""_this isn't going to end well_"", an exasperated Cliff asks him how he can be so certain, and Ronnie says it's because he's read the script. This upsets Cliff because he was only allowed to read the scenes in which he appeared, prompting him to complain that he's helped ""Jim"" out many times in the past and this is the thanks he gets. A few minutes later, when something especially bizarre happens with Zelda (like, really bizarre), an incredulous Cliff asks Ronnie ""_was that in the script?_"" (according to Ronnie, it was not). And the point of all this self-reflexivity? Honestly, I'm not entirely sure. The fact that only Cliff and Ronnie seem to know they're in a movie is, in and of itself, a little strange, and the fact that it only comes up a few times means that it never really gels as a motif. If I was to guess, I'd say that Jarmusch may be using it in the Brechtian sense to ensure the audience remains a consciously critical observer, more engaged with the narrative on an intellectual level than an emotional level.

For all its positives, however, the film does have some problems. For one thing, the last ten minutes or so will irritate a lot of people, as Jarmusch abandons all semblance of narrative, and gives us a scene over which Hermit Bob delivers a dire assessment of who we are as a species. It's very preachy, it's very didactic, and it will rub some people up the wrong way. Another issue is the humour, which is best described as Jarmuschian – all awkward stilted dialogue, deadpan one-liners, people repeating things other people have said, and subtle winking at the audience. It definitely isn't the kind of broad stroke humour one finds in zombie comedies such as Edgar Wright's _Shaun of the Dead_ (2004) or Ruben Fleischer's _Zombieland_ (2009). Some of the political themes are also underexplored. For example, Frank's MAGA hat is a pointed critique of Trump and those who blindly vote for him and excuse his behaviour, but to what end? Aside from introducing the hat, Jarmusch doesn't really say anything more on the subject. The trio of kids from the detention centre are also introduced as if they will be major players, but they're gradually forgotten about, and ultimately don't play much of a role the story. Also, as Jarmusch himself is well aware, the film isn't really saying anything that Romero hasn't already said.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed _The Dead Don't Die_. It's certainly nowhere near Jarmusch's best, and I can totally understand people who dislike it; a lot of the themes have been explored before, a lot of the jokes have been made before, and the film ends up as neither a terrifying thriller nor a self-conscious meta-comedy, instead occupying a strange middle ground between the two. In this sense, it doesn't do a huge amount to stand out in a crowded field. Having said that, however, the socio-political commentary is undeniably relevant and the cast is universally impressive. And ultimately, you may have a problem with the cynical manner with which the film communicates its message, but that doesn't alter the fact that that message is absolutely legitimate.",2019-09-23T23:17:49.367Z,7.0,The Dead Don't Die,2019

Eight Legged Freaks is unashamedly homaging B movie creature features from the 1950s. The likes of Tarantula and Them! have their Pedipalps well and truly watered, in what is possibly the most undervalued of all the modern day creature feature homages. Having no pretensions what so ever, the only real thing not in ""Freaks"" favour is the usage of CGI, but even that doesn't hurt the film, if anything it adds to the obvious preposterous nature of the genre. I mean how else are we to get 20 foot jumping spiders chowing down on some annoying teenager?

Perhaps ""Freaks"" is viewed harsh because the cast is relatively C list? Again that is a genre staple, surely? For what it's worth I think they do real fine, David Arquette has oodles of goofy charisma, Kari Wuher makes a fine female ass kicker, and the kids (one a young Scarlett Johansen) are really rather cool. Director Ellory Elkayem, who after doing They Nest in 2000 clearly has bug issues, adheres to genre staples. Kooky western town out in the desert, the inhabitants of which range from near loonies to dopey politicians, and the plot follows the traditional sense of impending doom played for laughs. Listen out for the score from John Ottman, which plays on variants of ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"", whilst cast a keen eye on John S. Bartley's Arizona camera work.

Whilst not having the savvy scripting of homage daddy, Tremors, or the star appeal of 1990's Arachnophobia, Eight Legged Freaks deserves its place amongst such fun and creepy company.

In the first 1/3 of the film, there is a ridiculous number of cuts in the action scenes (didn't like it), but afterwards this wasn't a problem.  So yeah, chaotic filming at the start, but much more enjoyable/conventional for the middle and end.

(P.S. There is at least one VERY scary scene in the first 1/3... despite the chaotic cinematography!)

This film TRIED to tie up all the loose end of the franchise, but it didn't do very well.  At least we get to see Claire Redfield again... she looks hot as always, but we don't see her much, and she doesn't have anything to say about K-Mart or her brother, Chis Redfield!

The biggest disappointment for me was the lame death of the ""big bad"" ... that is, Wesker.  I won't spoil his demise here, but let's just say it was Dues Ex Machina... (for those without a Latin background, it means an ass-pull by the writers!)

I guess Wesker was too awesome to defeat in a fair fight!  Anyway, the final battle of Alice was against *SPOILIER* Dr. Isaacs!  Actually the final battle was against Dr. Isaacs and his clone!!

I have mixed opions about this film... it tried, and in some sense succeeded in giving a finality to the movie franchise.  But it also failed in many ways.  The 3D was pretty crappy compared to the last two films ( I just learned they filmed this one in 2D and then up-converted it to 3D in post-production... unlike RE 4 and RE 5 which were REALLY filmed in 3D... so yeah, the human eye [at least my eye] can spot the difference between real art and AFTER-THE-FACT-POST-PRODUCTION cinematography).

Also, they completely skipped what happened in Washington DC (the end of the previous film).  There is one line in the movie which referenced this... basically ""Wesker betrayed Alice and didn't REALLY give her back full power of the T-Virus"".  As a fan, I found this lame 1-liner very dissatisfying for the series finale! :(

So now you may think I am an RE hater, but that isn't the full truth.  I felt this film was *literally* too dark, and the 3D was merely acceptable (not fantastic like prior films), but it did give a conclusion and explored upon things like clones of Alice...

I guess the only/biggest fault is the plot in the final scene... an air-borne virus, which will literally take years to work (according the movie itself!) manages to kill hundreds of thousands of zombies IN AN INSTANT... at the movie's climax... this is too convenient/stupid to be believed by anyone... even an RE Fan like me.  I'm sorry, but can you say EPIC FAIL?

== EPILOGUE ==
This film tries, and in a few cases succeeds, to tie up the Resident Evil franchise.  But the fake-3D *FAILS* compared to the real-3D of the prior two films.

173897,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I would say that my expectations for this movie was pretty much spot on. I expected a visual action feast with a fair amount of gore in it and that is pretty much what I got. Things like a well developed script and stuff like that, well obviously the producer thought asking for such things would be nitpicking.

It currently holds a 5.6 rating at IMDb and 60% user score on TMDb which is fairly well deserved. Of course there are always reviewers giving it single star ratings and saying it is the worst film ever. That is just bullshit. These people have obviously never seen a really bad movie.

Milla Jovovich is again playing the hot zombie killing chick from the previous movies and although she tragically lost her superior T-virus strength in one of the previous installments her capacity for dealing death and mayhem as well as absorbing hits still borders on being super hero stuff. Unrealistic but fun to watch.

Despite my comments on the script earlier there is actually one with a paper thin thread intended just to bring the story from point A to B with a maximum of violence and special effects in between. I do think the tanks that they had cooked up looked cool although they were just visual candy a’la Mad Max. I mean come one, a tank with ventilation shafts all over the place so all you had to do was pour some gazoline over it and light a match? Stupid to say the least.

There were a few other things was more designed for looks than realism. For instance a certain ventilation fan that were used to drag out some of the events. Who the f… designs a ventilation fan with a dozen or so rings of blades? It is a ventilation fan for Christ sake, not a jet engine turbine. Oh, yes of course, stupid me, otherwise they would not have to spend so much time crawling through it.

I did like the various mutated zombies as well by the way. The flying thing at the beginning and the end was quite cool. Some people seems to have had an issue with the fast, sometimes very fast, clipping of scenes. I have to say that it did not disturb me that much. Not that it added much either though.

Speaking of the end. Well, I guess it was okay. The end itself was not too surprising. It was dragged down by the stupid nonsense with Dr. Isaacs though. The only time an exploding grenade resulted in anything less than a semi-atomic eruption of flames was of course when the director had decided that he needed the bad guy for a few more scenes. Lazy and stupid script writing.

On the whole I enjoyed the movie as much as I expected to. It was an okay movie. Good for a evening fix of zombie splattering and Milla Jovovich (okay so what, I am a male of traditional sexual orientation you know).

The series never meant to be story based. Well, at the first it was fine, but then it turned out be more a video game style than the normal commercial films. So if you are going to watch it, your expectation from it should be the action-adventures. Of course, nothing happens without a reason, that's where the story was born. This is the sixth film in the series and they are saying it is the final, but have to wait and see in a couple of years, whether another film will be made or they are going for television as hinted out.

The main character is long dead, that's what they say to us every time. And then a new sequel with the same character and their explanation is, clone. That's seems okay, but that being a regular thing is what annoying. This film is enjoyable, like I say, watching a game played by someone sitting next to us. But not the best of the series or the year, nor its kind. Just to enjoy the action sequences. All the top, knowing about Olivia Jackson made me almost to cry. She's the real hero, hats off.

As I said, the film was not necessary if you go by the story. It was just another mission, a fight to bring down the last remaining Umbrella Corp and possibly to reveal more secrets about it and everything so far happened. I always wondered how this franchise survived this long. Yeah, every time a decent box office pushed the filmmakers and actors to go for another one. The film's main ingredient, graphics were acceptable, and performances too. So, it is only for the selected audience, but you can ignore it if you are not that interested in it.

173897,RalphRahal,"Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016) finally delivers a proper conclusion to the franchise, packing in all the plot threads that were scattered throughout the previous movies. The story is actually there this time, and while it feels rushed and crammed into a single film, it at least attempts to tie everything together. The pacing is relentless, barely giving time to breathe, which works in some areas but also makes it feel like Anderson had no choice but to dump all the remaining plot into this last installment. At least the climax feels satisfying, providing closure in a way that previous films never managed to do.

The directing leans into chaotic action, but the editing is out of control. The number of cuts per second is absurd, making some sequences impossible to follow. While the cinematography has moments that could have been great, the rapid-fire editing ruins a lot of it, turning what should be intense action into a dizzying mess. Character changes happen, some expected, some odd, but they mostly serve the story. Ruby Rose is a fun addition, even if her role is small, and Milla, as always, keeps the momentum going with her energy and commitment.

The script is functional, prioritizing action over depth, and the dialogue does just enough to move things forward. The soundtrack is fitting, blending industrial and electronic beats to match the high-speed pacing. Overall, The Final Chapter is flawed but delivers what it set out to do—end the franchise with a bang. If you can get past the chaotic editing, it is a wild ride with plenty of action and just enough closure to make it feel like a proper send-off.",2025-02-03T12:44:29.616Z,5.0,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2016

As surprising (and shameful) as it might be, I didn't know the original tale of which the film is based on. Maybe I just couldn't remember because once I learned the story, it did seem familiar. Either way, not knowing anything before-hand is my favorite way of ""preparing"" myself to watch a movie. I was moderately interested in this horror take of Gretel & Hansel, and I was genuinely excited to see Sophia Lillis as the lead actress. I feel very divided about it. It's a super captivating film production-wise, but it lacks some emotionally compelling storytelling, especially in the last third of the narrative.

First of all, Sophia Lillis is excellent as Gretel. I really enjoyed her performances in It and It: Chapter Two, and I knew she had something special. It was a matter of time until she got the right role at the right movie, and Oz Perkins can thank her for carrying most of the story on her shoulders. With a well-balanced display, Lillis beautifully incorporates Gretel's persona, offering a good range of emotions, and proving that she has a future under horror projects.

Gretel's love for her brother is demonstrated both through affection and cold interactions, making their relationship feel less fairytale and more realistic. Sam Leakey is a pleasant surprise as Hansel, considering this is his acting debut. While it's noticeable that he's still green, he didn't annoy me at all, and he actually delivered a couple of great lines. Alice Krige offers a cliche yet weirdly captivating performance as the evil witch.

Nevertheless, it's through its beautiful visuals and addictive original score (very 80s-like) that Gretel & Hansel got me invested until the end. Its production and set design create such an immersive environment, and its score (Robin Coudert) elevates basically every single scene. Galo Olivares' cinematography features an unusual style, but one that easily generates tension and suspense. Technically, it's honestly a fantastic surprise, I was not expecting such a high-level film in these regards.

However, it all comes down to the two main components of every movie: screenplay and characters. Even if Gretel is well-developed, the other characters could have received a bit of more care. The screenplay is the main issue, though. It starts with narration and heavy exposition. Something that takes too much out of the runtime, and it seems partially unnecessary since some of the information is somewhat repeated later on. It also spoils (well, it heavily hints) the connecting dots to the second half's mystery, turning that half too predictable and, to be completely honest, a tad boring.

The ending is also underwhelming. By not being able to properly close the narrative, the feeling of disappointment is tricky to avoid. It's one of those films that will definitely divide critics and audiences all around the world. The first group still has the technical aspects that can captivate anyone until the very end. However, audiences simply want to be entertained, and the purposefully slow pacing won't help, so I do understand if this group has an adverse reaction to this adaptation.

All in all, Gretel & Hansel is a pretty uncommon horror flick. It possesses technical features worthy of the very best movies of the same genre, but its screenplay lacks creativity and overall quality. A predictable narrative with slow pacing is (almost?) never a good attribute. Nevertheless, Sophia Lillis is an outstanding lead, giving a great performance. Galo Olivares' cinematography is pretty unique, the production and set design make the whole environment very immersive, but it's the addictive score from Robin Coudert that steals the spotlight. Oz Perkins shows excellent directing skills, but a less appealing second half with a disappointing third act doesn't let this film reach its true potential.

I had decently high hopes for this, given it is my favorite genre and Train to Busan was pretty good. However, this was a major disappointment.

**The good**  
The plot, set four years in the future from Train to Busan and decent build-up with ok back story to most things going on. General atmosphere is also nice.

**The bad**  
Giant plot holes, some so large and obvious it is almost impossible to enjoy the movie.

Vehicle CGI, especially the physics. It is so bad my dead dog would make it better. To make matters worse these scenes make up for an unreasonably large portion of the movie. I got seriously angry watching it, and I love zombies and car chases.

581392,Leno,"Peninsula came amidst extremely high expectations for being the sequel of one of the best zombie movies ever. This movie is completely unrelated to its prequel, _Train to Busan_, so you can watch it even if haven't seen the first one. The plot follows another group who fled from Korea in a refugee boat to Hong Kong. Fast-forward 4 years, the surviving members of the group return to a deserted Korea to ransack the abandoned money. A task that should be easy, but Incheon is not as deserted as they thought it would be.

With a lot of action scenes and good visual effects, Peninsula failed in the casting of the support roles. The main actors are pretty good, but the acting of the foreigner (that is, non-Korean) characters is laughable. Also, parts of the plot and some actions scenes are highly implausible, to say the least.

However, Peninsula is still a very good movie, ranking high in the ""Best Zombie Movies"" list. It didn't live up to the expectations from _Train to Busan_, but perhaps the bar set by the prequel was just too high.",2020-12-01T03:05:35.618Z,7.0,Peninsula,2020

Train to Busan is one of my favorite South Korean films ever, and I firmly defend that it's one of the best zombie apocalypse movies of all-time, maybe even the best. Therefore, I couldn't help but feel incredibly excited about another installment set in the same world. It's not a direct sequel to the original's story, but it seems to be placed just after the pandemic began. Unfortunately, it ends up being a huge disappointment.

Despite the jaw-dropping stunt work and the extremely intense action sequences, the reason why Peninsula's predecessor works so well is due to its focus on the characters. By giving them a compelling development and a strong emotional bond, the zombie outbreak becomes instantly more effective because of our immense concern for everyone involved. Every technical element is dialed up to its maximum, transforming the film into an emotionally devastating, heart-wrenching story.

Yeon Sang-ho tries to follow a shortcut to achieve that same emotion of his previous movie, dooming this ""sequel"" from the very beginning. Every relationship feels forced, and the supposedly heartbreaking decisions/events are a complete target miss. Even the action scenes fail to live up to the original's level due to excessive CGI in ridiculous car chases. Every fifteen minutes, a major logical issue arises, and some characters are either straight-up dumb or unbelievably smart for their age/experience. Peninsula takes the realistic environment established by Train to Busan and fictionalizes it way too much.

Sure it is not the best Stephen King adaptation, but it is far from the worst.  Some fairly hammy acting, dodgy CGI and tonnes of cliché Stephen King tropes don't stop this film from being lightweight fun, so long as you are not expecting a work of art.  

Damien Lewis is a stand-out, especially when he is being the Mr Gray personality and most of the rest of the cast do well enough, with a little bit of coasting from Tom Sizemore and Morgan Freeman.  It is however hard to look past the patronising and mildly offensive portrayal of the idiot savant Duddits, and the ending is completely stupid.

Take it as it is, take it as a movie and its not half bad, the problem is that, once you leave the book behind what you have is an old fashioned B horror movie that is trying to sell itself in an era where B horror movies need the special effects of modern super hero movies and the basic plot of a Dick and Jane novel.

And then, in many ways, it's just too expensive. It feels like a classic Drive-In horror flick, but it looks like a block buster. Tone down the budget by a few million and make it a direct to video movie and it would have cult classic status already...despite the people that actually read the source material.

The acting is good, the special effects are too good, the setting is cool, but the plot hurts a bit and the fact that Duddits is Intellectually Disabled is inevitably going to put off more that a few viewers.

The makers here add a zombie slant to things, which in truth is just another excuse for a monsters on the loose plot.

Plot finds Amber Heard (The Stepfather/All the Boys Love Mandy Lane) as troubled arsonist Kristen. Shunted into a mental institution post haste, Kristen finds herself menaced by a violent ghost that seems intent on ridding the ward of all its female inhabitants.

The odd boo-jump comes and goes, making it not a complete dead loss on the scare front, while the cast are solid in performances and Carpenter shows some trade mark camera techniques to make certain scenes pulse with anxiety. It then hurries along to the big reveal, which sadly disappoints because it just comes off as something done far better in horror/thriller films previously. It was easy money for Carpenter, and us acolytes don't begrudge him that, while it isn't the embarrassment some have made it out to be, but it is average fare and not a great way for JC to bow out from horror movie making - director wise that is. 6/10",2015-03-30T06:46:41.803Z,6.0,The Ward,2010

… actually it’s a ranch house, but close enough.  Anyway, they start getting picked off by a mad slasher with the most promiscuous ones dying first. Sound familiar?

“All the Boys Love Mandy Lane” debuted at film festivals in 2006 but curiously wasn’t released to theaters until 2013. I’m surprised this was even released to theaters because it’s a low-budget indie slasher, nothing more. It cost $750,000, which is more than enough to make a competent film. The well-done “Another Kind” (2013), for instance, only cost $120,000. But “Mandy Lane” is just too all-around hackneyed and meh, which isn’t helped by the fact that half the characters are repellent (e.g. Jake, Marlin & Chloe).

Thankfully, the filmmaking is competent with some nice cinematography of central Texas and Amber Heard in an early role is a highlight. Plus there’s a surprise at the end, but it makes you question the person’s motives. If you reflect on the material, though, it all makes sense and shows that some thought was put into the script. Of course this doesn’t help the dull shallowness of most of the characters (who are SUPPOSED to be shallow, I get it).

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes and was shot in the heart of Texas (Austin & Bastrop) with other stuff done in Santa Clarita, CA.

46261,Matt Golden,"Oh, this is the stuff. How I’ve missed great horror. American studios have, by and large, ignored producing truly great horror over mindless pablum like Final Destination 6, or Saw 23, or Nostalgic Horror Film Remake 117. Slashers, gore-fests, dead teenager movies and all the other imagination-barren dreck neglect that incredible power a great horror film can wield over its viewer: namely, that it’s the only genre that can truly encompass every emotion, running the audience through the gamut so thoroughly that they’re exhausted and fully satisfied at the end.

Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark is a great horror film. I’d also rank it up there with the great fantasy films; dark fantasy, to be sure, as dark as it gets, but fantasy all the same. It’s a faery tale, with the a-e spelling, replete with faeries, an evil stepmother, a princess and a castle.

Oh, and what a castle it is: the film takes place in the dark, dusty confines of the gloriously decaying Blackwood Manor, a house into which reasonable people would never dream of entering, much less owning. Luckily for us, this faery tale is populated by and large with unreasonable people, for reasonable people have no place in faery tales.

Little Sally Hirst is sent to live with her father in Blackwood Manor, as her mother doesn’t want her anymore. Her father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his live-in girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) are working on restoring the mansion to its former glory, it having been empty for the last hundred years. But Sally’s arrival awakens…things.

Lurking things.

Hungry things.

Little do Sally, Alex and Kim know the dark history of what happened to old Emerson Blackwood, and the secrets that the bolted-shut fireplace holds, or what has been unleashed at Blackwood Manor.

The tropes of the faery tales are both apparent and subverted here. Sally (Bailee Madison) is a withdrawn, sullen child, wise beyond her years and smart enough to know she’s been abandoned. Alex is a father who loves his daughter, but doesn’t know how to be a parent to her. Kim is a de facto stepmother who didn’t ask for this child but does her best to provide Sally with warmth and love, particularly in lieu of Alex. Terrors are visited upon the girl, but only she knows they’re real; after all, what parents truly believe there are monsters under their child’s bed? Parents know that the monsters aren’t real, even if they are. Children know the monsters are real, and no collection of assurances, no matter how lovingly given, offer enough protection.

Bailee Madison is the focus of the film, and she gives a terrific performace. She’s a real little girl, not a falsely-spun Hollywood version of one. She is reckless, irresponsible, smart, sullen, and terrified. Katie Holmes shines as the stepmother who tries her hardest. Guy Pearce fares well, though he has the most thankless role as the Parent Who Doesn’t Believe.

One of the great strengths of the film is how it uses that frustrating disbelief as one of its pillars. The creatures are eventually seen, in ever more apparent lighting, and what that removes from their eeriness it adds to their threat; we know, as does Sally, that these monsters are real, and without help, harm will come. It’s an growing, inexorable conclusion that is terrifying in its mounting inevitability.

The entirety of the film is masterfully crafted: the acting is uniformly excellent, the atmosphere is thick and foreboding, the cinematography lush and gorgeous, the art direction is darkly enchanting and the sound design (particularly of the creatures) is terrifying. Even after the creatures have been revealed, their terror doesn’t diminish, and I credit that not only to the sure hand of first-time director Troy Nixey but also the impeccable sound design.

Nixey, a former comic book artist, was hand-picked by producer and cowriter Guillermo del Toro after seeing Nixey’s short film “Latchkey’s Lament.” It was a perfect choice. Del Toro worked for decades on remaking this film, based on an ABC movie of the week from the 1970s starring Kim Darby. He said the film terrified him so much that it was the impetus for him to go into horror filmmaking. And del Toro’s signature touches are all around, from the youthful heroine to the incorporation of faery tales to the trademark art design. None of that should dilute the appreciation for Nixey’s work, however; it’s so rare to find a director who takes time to build atmosphere and ratchet up tension to the breaking point rather than telegraph every scare and pull the trigger too soon.

The film is rated R, for there is no other rating to accommodate it. The filmmakers were attempting for a PG-13 film, which they thought they could accomplish without overt gore, language, or sex. When they submitted it for rating, the MPAA gave it an R for intensity, saying it was non-negotiable for “pervasive scariness.” Upon being asked what they could do to get a more commercially-viable PG-13, the MPAA responded “Why ruin a perfectly scary movie?”

Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark has what is so lacking in horror films today: imagination. Dark, terrifying, magnificent imagination. The kind that makes you glad you’re able to sit there, in a darkened theater, and let it devour you whole.",2013-07-21T18:27:05.035Z,,Don't Be Afraid of the Dark,2010

But I do have the urge to get back at him and his hardcore following that I feel can be quite pretentious when touting his work as some genius social/political commentary.

I had the slightest hope that there may be something good here (given that it has 61% on Rotten Tomatoes. [A whole 8% better than Bullet Train?!?!

No; then it should be a lot smarter. I will say that the point about our relationship with technology has aged pretty well. People are more obsessed with it now than ever. But it still doesn't make the character's actions reasonable. It is still dumb. And it isn't a unique take. Everything feels one-dimensional and unrealistic. I must not vibe with Romero's style where it feels like he is making his point so bluntly and sacrificing everything else to do so. This is down with the worst of The Walking Dead's worst spin-offs. But possibly still in with the best of the large pool of terrible zombie movies. I mean, a couple of the effects were actually impressive compared to the rest of the film.

11804,The Movie Diorama,"White Noise fizzles out its noisy static by just being plain boring. Watching Keaton as he unconvincingly stares at televised white noise for an hour and a half, which is essentially nothing, perfectly surmises the experience of Sax' supposedly supernatural horror. However, the biggest crime that the studio committed was releasing the feature on the first weekend of the year. Now, it's common knowledge that the initial start to the cinematic year typically begins with a disposable horror. Well, White Noise is to blame. Signalling untapped box office potential, despite the overt opinions of critics. And, as to be expected, matches the quality of a broken tape. A successful architect loses his wife to a drowning accident, to which he then encounters a psychic introducing him to the supernatural phenomenon of EVP.

Electronic Voice Phenomena. Y'know, recording background noise in a room, playing back the tape and flabbergasted when the ghost of ‪Michael Jackson‬ hauntingly sings ""Thriller"". Except in White Noise the tool that's used is, well, white noise. The annoyingly hypnotising static from televisions when no channel is picked up from the current frequency. Keaton becomes entranced by the ominous voices and high definition faces he sees within the six televisions he owns in his modern apartment. Who is making contact? Is it his wife? Malevolent entities trapped in the cubic prison that is a television? Pretty sure writer Johnson didn't even know himself.

The film is a mess. It's muddled, confused and abhorrently remains stagnant throughout. This architect, a father, essentially abandons his son when fixated on saving souls warned by his deceased wife that conveniently match the images in the white noise as soon as he arrives to any given scenario, despite ""Willow Avenue"" being mentioned days before. So think of it as 'Final Destination' meets 'Pulse' (original, obviously...). Except it's neither as entertaining as the former nor as horrifying as the latter.

Keaton looked bored as hell and overacted in times of emotional distress, although reassured the narrative with control. The jump scares were obnoxiously tame, yet admittedly one of the piercing noises made me twitch my body. The ending is...well, let's just not talk about it. It's terrible, with CGI ghost things swooping in on Batman, and answers no lingering questions that the mystery of EVP conjured up. Heck, the feature begins and concludes with onscreen text about ""existing"" occurrences. ""1 in 12 cases are dangerous"". Yeah. Ok. You know what is dangerous? Ruining Keaton's career. We had to wait a decade later for his rejuvenation!

19994,John Chard,"PMS isn't real Needy, it was invented by the boy-run media to make us seem like we're crazy. 

Jennifer's Body is directed by Karyn Kusama and written by Diablo Cody. It stars Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, J.K. Simmons, Andy Sedaris and Adam Brody. Music is by Stephen Barton and Thodore Shapiro and cinematography by M. David Mullen. Plot finds Fox as a High School cheerleader who gets possessed by a demon and starts eating the boys from school. Seyfried is the homely best friend who tries to stop her.

Women impacting on the horror genre from the directing or writing chairs is in short supply, sadly the team-up of Diablo Cody and Karyn Kusama has barely made a stain on this issue. The intentions, you feel, were honourable from the outset, an attempt to blend hip pop culture comedy with demonic horror, wrapped around the perils of High School sexual learnings, unfortunately the final product is decidedly tepid. Neither funny, bloody or scary, and with weak CGI into the bargain, film feels confused in trying to cover so many bases. The High School setting is lazy, Kusama isn't able to build suspense and Cody's writing misses the required emotional beats. Cast are fine, the odd gag scores some giggles and the film is often sexy, while the score literally does rock, but all told it's just too messy, too studio safe for its own good. 5/10",2019-07-21T06:37:49.463Z,5.0,Jennifer's Body,2009

Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried’s chemistry is one of the highlights. Their dynamic as Jennifer and Needy feels authentic, charged with tension, and full of layers. Megan Fox, often criticized for her emotional range, really brought something extra to this role. She captures Jennifer’s dangerous allure and underlying insecurities in a way that makes her both menacing and fascinating. And let’s be honest—Fox’s charisma and screen presence are off the charts here.

What I like is that the movie has more going on under the surface. Sure, it’s about a demon-possessed cheerleader eating boys, but there’s also stuff about friendship, jealousy, and even how women are underestimated or exploited. There’s a lot of deeper meaning if you take the time to think about it (or look it up online, let’s be honest).

The production overall was pretty good. The locations were well chosen, and the cinematography had some cool details, like those subtle shifts in perspective with handheld shots and close-ups. It really added to the tension without being too flashy.

For me, Jennifer’s Body is one of those movies that just works. It’s fun, has great performances, and leaves you thinking a bit more than you’d expect from a horror-comedy. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely worth a rewatch—and yeah, Megan Fox totally owned this one.",2024-12-16T09:17:42.911Z,8.0,Jennifer's Body,2009
282035,panic jr8,"Oh gosh. Where do I even start. This film sucks. 

Now before I begin to tear this film into shreds, let me give you some background. I was excited for this movie. I love Tom Cruise. I love Sofia Boutella. I love Russell Crowe. I love the Universal Monsters. 

Lets just say I was disappointed.

This film has some of the worst tonal problems in a film ever. An inconsistent tone is my biggest pet peeve. Sometimes it's scary. Sometimes it's a huge action blockbuster. Sometimes it's trying to be like Brendan Frasier's ""The Mummy."" It doesn't know what it is.

The female lead (who's name I can't remember) is incredibly bland. Not her acting, she's actually quite good. It's the writing is what makes her bad. 

Jake Johnson's character is one of the most annoying characters in a movie ever. And I mean that. I hated almost every scene he was in.

The few high notes: Sofia Boutella kills it. Russell Crowe is delightfully campy. Tom Cruise gives another solid performance despite his character being super unlikable.

Alex Kurtzman is what hurts this film. The direction is quite bland. Kurtzman is a bad screenwriter and a just as bad director.

This film is a mess. Tonal problems and bland writing. Some fun action scenes and performances can't keep this film from being a boring trainwreck.

Tome Cruise was like a walking joke in this and while I saw this in the cinema, people were laughing during an action scene that was actually badly put together and I didn't realise this until now.

282035,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"In view of the reviews this movie has received I was not expecting much. Being a Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror fan I had to watch it regardless of what people said about it of course.
I have to say that I do not understand why so many seem to claim it is utter crap. Sure, it is not a great movie but it is not really bad either. 

It is not just a remake of the original The Mummy movies which I think is actually good. That concept is becoming a bit deja vue after all.

To me the worst part of the movie was Tom Cruise. Total lack of charisma. He really do not succeed in his role. He is mostly wondering about being meh and just reacts to the various situations he is thrown into.

Russell Crowe is a lot better as Doctor Jekyll. I quite like Doctor Jekyll being thrown into the mix by the way. I think his role worked quite well and was well played.

Being a mummy movie there are of course a lot of supernatural stuff, curses, monsters and action. In general I think it was reasonably well done. The special effects were enjoyable and the mummy herself, Sofia Boutella, was not bad at all.

On the whole the movie and the story held a lot of promise but in the end the overall performance failed to really impress. There were plenty of good things but they were just not put to good work. I think the movie would have fared a lot better with a more charismatic lead in it and perhaps a bit better script for him.

Bottom line, I did enjoy the movie. As I wrote it is not really bad but it could have been quite a bit better. The good parts were sometimes really good but in between it felt like everyone went to lunch and let the janitors have a go at movie making.",2017-10-27T09:39:07.666Z,6.0,The Mummy,2017
282035,John Chard,"Disappointingly unoriginal and average.

So here we go, then, Universal begin their rebirth of the Universal Creature franchise (Dark Universe) with a crack at old bandage features, The Mummy, sadly the result is very average at best. You would think that with so many ""Mummy"" films of the past already on the market this new lease of life would be giving us, well, something new to gorge on, but what we actually get is a painfully familiar.

From a summer blockbuster audience pleaser point of view it has the requisite effects work, it's loud, rambunctious and has Cruise and Crowe for star wattage, but Cruise is going through the motions, Crowe is laughably miscast (with a later dreadful accent issue to compound the misery), while the rest of the cast play second fiddle to the over egged effects work.

It's neither dark enough as a head bothering thinker or witty enough to tickle the funny bone, in fact it at times is very dull. There's also the worrying attempts at crossing over into further creature feature ventures, a big reveal for a main character is sloppily handled, whilst the finale lands as flat as a pancake.

There's some nice touches, the ""Mummy"" design is sharp (love those eyes), a plane crash is exhilarating and the film's stand out sequence, and the tomb/prison design is neat, but after that you start to scratch around for positives, which in itself tells a story. At least it looks and sounds great in HD, the colours and sub-woofer shakes a treat for the senses.

It's all well and good people asking for it not to be judged by other Mummy films, but the creators here make that inevitable. Lifting the plot from one of the 1940's films, and even stealing a scene from the Stephen Sommers school of Mummy film making. It's unoriginal and as an opening salvo for a franchise it leaves Universal with a hell of a lot of work to do to make it work. 5/10",2017-10-29T08:00:35.952Z,5.0,The Mummy,2017
282035,Reno,"**The first in the Universal studio's 'Dark Universe'!**

If you see the history, the reboots usually fails. It has to be at least half a century old to reboot like 'King Kong'. So the technology advantage would play a major role. It was less than the 20 years, the last 'The Mummy' film had released and pretty impressed everybody with modern visual effects. Even today's young generation getting used to that when it was played on the television. Comparing this to that, there's nothing much other than more perfection in graphics and additional digital 3D. In my opinion, they should have waited another decade.

It was exactly reversed version of the 1999 film. I mean the character designs. Like female mummy coming to life and targeting a man for the ultimate power possession. Two US army men in Iraq found a hidden tomb like structure from the Egyptian era beneath the sand. The recovered ancient coffin shipped to England, but the plane crash down. Since then, an unknown force begins to hunt down one of that two army men. Fighting against it, followed by how the story ends comes in the later parts.

When I first heard about the reboot, I said oh no! Hearing about Tom Cruise's involvement, it became double no! Actually, he was good in the film, but the film was unnecessary at this generation. Even though it did good at the box office, it was considered a decent run. But the studio has a bigger plan, that you would know if you watch the film, that they had already developed a plot for at least two more films with enough characters to carry on that long. If needed, it would add more in the latter. I feel that's a bad idea right now. Watching it one time is not bad, but no special at all.

Two American soldiers & treasure-hunters (Tom Cruise and Jake Johnson) discover the tomb of evil Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), who attempted to summon the death-god Set but was seized and mummified alive. They and an attractive archaeologist (Annabelle Wallis) fly Ahmanet's sarcophagus to Britain when all hell breaks loose. Russell Crowe is also on hand. 

""The Mummy"" (2017) is the reboot of The Mummy trilogy of 1999-2008 and the first official film in Universal’s Dark Universe franchise, which reimagines & updates the classic universal monsters.  The producers flirted with the idea of ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) being part of the Dark Universe, and the epilogue of that movie set in the modern world suggested this, but the idea was dropped. While “The Mummy” garnered $410 million worldwide, it was considered a disappointment and critics generally lambasted it.

I found the modern setting a nice change of environment compared to the late 1920s-40s of the previous trilogy; it prevented it from being the same-old-same-old. I also didn't mind the various locations outside of ancient Egypt, e.g. northern Iraq and England; even Hammer's version from 1959 started in Egypt, but quickly moved to England. I also favored the switch to a female mummy and that the slightly convoluted story kept you guessing. So the flick gets points for NOT being one-dimensional and hackneyed. 

I enjoyed it for the most part, although it coulda been more compelling in the latter portions. It has the same spirit of high adventure of the 1999 movie mixed with gothic horror (including creepy zombies) and a bit o’ comedy, but not too much. While the curious inclusion of Dr. Jekyll (Crowe) smacked of pushing the new franchise, it didn’t ruin the viewing experience. And winsome Wallis doesn’t hurt.

<em>'The Mummy'</em> begins with promise. I initially enjoyed the duo of Tom Cruise and Jake Johnson, the plot set-up and the location choice of London. Russell Crowe is a standout name too. However, sadly, the film gets progressively worse throughout the 110 minutes.

The premise kinda just falls into itself, with any interest disappearing pretty quickly. The link between Cruise and Johnson becomes tiresome, as does all the comedy in the film in truth - there's a few chuckles, but nothing laugh worthy. The zombie vibe doesn't fit, either.

What also doesn't help is the fact they're blatantly trying to set up a film universe of some sort, which they put too much focus on. I found the effects hit-and-miss, I feel like they could've used more practical stuff rather than relying so much on CGI - for the make-up et al. at least.

Cruise leads ably and does a decent enough job - he has done far greater of course. Crowe never really gets going in my opinion, though does have a couple of cool to look at scenes late on. Sofia Boutella is alright, as is Annabelle Wallis. A meh for the cast.

The Lawnmower Man is directed by Brett Leonard who also co-writes the screenplay with Gimel Everett. It stars Pierce Brosnan, Jeff Fahey, Jenny Wright, Geoffrey Lewis, Jeremy Slate and Dean Norris. Music is by Dan Wyman and cinematography by Russell Carpenter.

 

Dr. Lawrence Angelo (Brosnan) is a big mover in the science of virtual reality. When he tries his new technology  on mentally challenged gardener Jobe Smith (Fahey), it elevates him to a higher intelligence and it’s not long before Jobe acquires scary new powers…

 

Originally meant to be, and titled as, Stephen King’s Lawnmower Man, the film eventually, after a King lawsuit, ended up bearing very little resemblance to the author’s short story. There’s a couple of small ligaments that link the two, but in the main (not Maine) this Lawnmower Man is its own entity and an obvious attempt to cash in on the then virtual reality zeitgeist.

 

Lawnmower Man has a cult fan base, of that there is no doubt, where much like Tron from 10 years earlier, the effects work and the capturing of something very much being “in” with the youth of the time,  has proved perpetually appealing to nostalgists. But strip away these and you have your basic Frankenstein story for the 90s, a pretty standard story lacking intelligent smarts or deep thematic points of worth. And then of course there is the bizarre fact of having a film decrying the advancement of computer technology, by using computer technology to make the film’s strongest moments! Hee. It’s only adequately performed by the cast, and Leonard’s direction matches his writing, which is mundane when not about the visual effects; effects work that dated very quickly as it happened.

 

Other cuts and sequels would follow, the former didn’t improve the same basic problems of the theatrical cut, the latter releases proved to be laughably bad.

602223,garethmb,"In what is being billed as the final Purge movie; “The Forever Purge” has arrived and like elements of the prior films; gains traction from current events which have only made elements of the film more chilling seeing how the film was originally planned for July of 2020.

Following the abolition of the Purge at the end of the “Purge Election Year”; the Holiday where all crime is legal for twelve hours is restored due to radical elements fueling fears of illegal immigration and the increase in crime immigrants will bring to the largely crime-free country.

It is not made clear what happened with the new President who was a staunch critic of the Purge and only that it has been restored so citizens prepare for its return by arming up, barricading themselves, or paying for armed security in a fortified locale.

It is against this backdrop that Adela (Ana de Reguera) has come to America fleeing the violence in her country as she enters illegally and finds work. Dylan Tucker (Josh Lucas) is a wealthy Rancher who along with his family hires friends and family of Adela though having some disdain for them and what they stand for.

The Purge comes and goes with the main cast unaffected and as they prepare to resume their lives; roving bands of armed gangs have continued to Purge in violation of the law similar to those who took to the street in protest of the election and plans to eliminate the Purge years prior.

This new group is well organized and has no issues taking on law enforcement and the military forcing Dylan, Adela, and their family and friends to flee for their lives. As the terror spreads, their only safety is to try to make it to Mexico who along with Canada has agreed to a six hour window to allow people to cross to escape the violence.

As the danger mounts, the severity of the movement is known as the authorities seem powerless to control and stop what is called The Forever Purge.

The film uses a slightly different formula than the prior films which focused mainly on a group of people trying to survive the night and the terrors that come with Purge Night.  There is a greater emphasis on racism and Xenophobia this time around directed more towards foreigners than minorities and poverty-stricken individuals but the underlying message is the same.

This time around we are given a longer timeframe of terror and more social commentary as there are elements from the film which seem eerily inspired by headlines past and present which makes the film even more chilling.

While the story is rather bare and the characters do not get much development; the movie should give fans of the series what they look forward to although it lacks the dramatic tension of the previous films.

In the end “The Forever Purge” is an interesting new chapter in the series but not one of the stronger entries and serves as an effective finale to the series should this turn out to be the final film.

*** This review contains minor spoilers ***

It doesn't have James Wan's name on the director's chair, but it's every inch a James Wan film. There seems to be a rut that has emerged where this new brand of horror film makers can't see that recycling the same ideas is, well, kinda dull.

Insidious, Dead Silence and The Conjuring have their critics (not me, I like them all very much), but the timing was right for them to hit the mark of many a horror film lover. Tapping into the fear of the doll and the demon hadn't been done for some time, certainly not with any conviction, so all good there for the fans.

Annabelle spins off from The Conjuring, and Dead Silence to a degree, but just comes off as a lazy cash-cow. The doll is a spooky monstrosity (most unlike the real Rag-Dolly-Anna version), but it's all a bit of a con, the makers resorting to another demonic being, only Red Darth Maul has now been replaced by Blue Lagoon The Loon.

Character's actions are often preposterous, stretching credulity to breaking point (I know you are being menaced by the unknown, but I got a conference to go to, sleep tight babe!). Elsewhere, while everyone acknowledges that what scares you is subjective, but the scares here are very thin on the ground, not helped by a dull script and bland lead actors.

It's tidy enough a production, granted, but familiarity breeds contempt and it's hoped that Wan's return to the director's chair for The Conjuring 2 (where we revisit the realm of poltergeist activity), signals a return to form for his horror stable. 5/10",2015-03-21T23:49:47.584Z,5.0,Annabelle I,2014

After about twenty minutes I thought I had been wrong, the opening had some originality and it seemed like something fresh. then they arrived at the Hotel and Anne Hathaway came on the scene like a wrecking ball. Any potential that this movie had was suffocated by Hathaways incredibly poor performance. Watch Anjelica Huston's performance in the original and you will see the MASSIVE difference in ability. Hathaway's performance is akin to an amateur impressionist. It feel more like an insult than an homage by Hathaway, she put zero effort or spirit into this character. Her accent is atrocious and her presence is almost nonexistent. Also the CGI already looks cheap, c'mon they had better puppets in the 80's. All witches now have joker smiles and shark teeth? This could've really been a good movie and it is just marred by an extremely poor performance from the lead villain, an overuse of cheap effects, poor pacing, lack of originality in the second half and a horrendous ending. The only highlights of this movie are Octavia Spencer and Jahzir Bruno who do a fantastic job of filling and updating their roles. Unfortunately as most fans know, Jahzir spends the second half of the movie as a poorly CGI'd mouse. Leaving Octavia Spencer to carry the entirety of the movie from there on out almost seems like a cruel prank. Tucci is decent as is Codie Eastwick as Bruno but there characters are so poorly written and used they practically add nothing. The addition of a third mouse is also meaningless and changes nothing in the story. Ultimately this movie is a far worse version of the first one. They actually managed to tell less of the story, give characters less development, and have worse effects than a movie made over 30 years ago. Some of this may have been forgivable if they added any decent original concepts but again this is a poor retread with no added substance.

531219,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"Unlike what a lot of people seems to think about this movie I though it was a fairly decent family movie. It’s not great but decent enough. I quite enjoyed it at least.

The story is what it is. It is a Roald Dahl story so it is somewhat dark but funny and with some light at the same time. Of course there are a bunch of whiners complaining that it is too dark and not suited for children. Well, everyone knows (or should now) what to expect from a Roald Dahl story so just go and see another movie then. My kids, even when they where younger, would have no problem with this movie. But then I would spend the time to watch it with them. It is called parenting.

The beginning felt a wee bit slow perhaps but once the grand witch, and in particular the three mice, entered the scene it became rather funny.

The one thing I did not like that much was the over the top silly acting of the witches, especially the grand witch. They could really have toned down that it bit to make her a bit more scary. Now she just became silly and somewhat annoying.

The special effects were quite nice. The mice was a bit cartoonish but that was okay for this movie. I quite liked how the grand witch’s mouth split open from time to time to reveal her “witchiness”.

Apparently a bunch of disability advocates,  including British Paralympic swimmer Amy Marren, got unhinged and claimed the movie was “perpetuating bias against individuals with ectrodactyly and other limb differences.”

Seriously? Get a grip. It is fiction and a family movie about witches for Christ sake! Presenting witches or other supernatural creatures as having “abnormalities” like crows feet, fangs and God knows what is what makes witches. If these obsessive whiners and cancel culture freaks would have their way no movie worth watching and no book worth reading would ever be made.

10066,Wuchak,"Engrossing and imaginative modern Mystery/Horror with Elisha Cuthbert 

RELEASED IN 2005 and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, ""House of Wax"" is a horror/slasher about six college students (4 dudes and 2 gals) who drive from Gainesville to Baton Rouge to attend a crucial football game. They end up camping in the woods somewhere off I-10 where some of the party discovers a mysterious town in the sticks that has a curious House of Wax. Horror and death ensue.

This is not a remake of the splendid 1953 Vincent Price cult flick of the same name. The only thing these two films have in common is their title, their genre, and the fact that they both involve a wax museum. It's therefore pointless to compare them as they are two totally different stories. Plot-wise, ""House of Wax"" is an obvious mixture of the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) and the 1953 film of the same name, along with elements of more modern flicks like “Wrong Turn” (2003) and torture porn.

Although the first 12 minutes or so are unimpressive with too much annoying shaky cam, the story starts to capture your attention at the camp-out sequence. From there their encounter with a horrible stench, a local hick, and the mystery of the isolated town & wax museum gradually pulls you in. The fairly slow initial 50-minutes are a crucial character-building and mystery-developing foundation to the final horrific hour.

The major protagonist of the story is Carly, played by Elisha Cuthbert, who was only 22 during filming and never looked better with her curvy cuteness. The glamorous and infamous Paris Hilton also stars and does a commendable job, but Elisha basically blows her out of the water as far as all-around beauty goes.

Speaking of Ms. Hilton, in light of the ads to “Come see Paris Hilton die,” it’s no secret that her character does indeed buy the farm and, the way it happens, is pretty amusing. The film's worth checking out for this scene alone, especially if you despise her.

The picture was shot in Queensland, Australia, of all places, but it works alright as a stand-in for the Deep South, although I don’t recall any hills along I-10, as depicted in the background of the town. Speaking of the town, it doesn’t look like a Deep South town, but rather a contrived set. Nevertheless, the filmmaking is top-notch in all categories with the rest of the no-name cast doing a fine job. As a matter of fact, the six college kids are all rather likable; even Nick (Chad Michael Murray), Carly’s supposedly 'black sheep' twin, once he shows his true colors.

""House of Wax"" works fabulously for what it IS, a mystery/slasher flick. The unlikely story is played straight and serious by all involved; there's no silly ""comedic relief"" or camp to be seen. Everyone knows going in that this isn't going to be ""Gandhi."" But if you're in the mood for an entertaining and imaginative mystery/horror picture, look no further. ""House of Wax"" has practically everything you’d want in such a film. Why do I describe it as imaginative? See the conclusion's spectacular melting wax museum and you'll understand; this is F/X at its finest.

523139,Sheldon Nylander,"“In the Tall Grass” is a Netflix film based on a short story/novella written by Stephen King and his son Joe Hill. A little disclosure that I have not read the original story, so I can’t attest as to how faithful this film is, so I’ll be looking at the movie on its own merits, as few as they may be.

We start with two siblings, Cal and a pregnant Becky who are travelling through Kansas (a plus here is that we have a story from Stephen King that does not take place in Maine) when they pull over to the side of the road when Becky gets morning sickness and they hear a boy calling for help from the tall grass field on the side of the road. They get separated from each other and realize that something weird is going on, that travelling in one direction doesn’t necessarily mean travelling in that direction and time is out of joint. Others that they meet in the field are Ross, played by Patrick Wilson, his son Tobin, his wife Natalie, and Lisa’s ex-boyfriend Travis.

Alright, so as more disclosure here, I filled in the names of these characters after looking them up. I honestly could not remember their names, that’s how much of an impression they left on me, with the possible exception of the boy because when we first see him he comes off really creepy. I mean, really, it’s not so much that you want any characters to die because they’re irritating. They’re just so cookie-cutter and stereotypical that they leave little to no lasting impression.

Another reason for this is that the audience can be a little too distracted by the grass itself. It does have a certain character to it, even if it’s nearly impossible to figure out. But I found myself distracted trying to figure out the grass, how it works, its motivations, at the expense of the human characters.

And here is where we run into another problem. Because most of the set looks the same, that being in the middle of a tall grass field, the filmmakers need to rely on a series of technical and visual gimmicks to keep the audience interested and focused. But they’re inconsistent and stand out when they use them (for example, one consistent shot that is a 360 degree rotation). They don’t feel natural. You see the gimmick instead of what the gimmick is trying to show you, although that’s arguable as they’re clearly proud of some of these visual effects. In addition, this being a horror movie, there are going to be jump scares, but jump scares are just about all there is for this horror movie.

The conclusion is pretty meh and isn’t really consistent with other parts of the movie from what we learn plotwise. All around, if you’re really a Stephen King or Joe Hill fan and have nothing else to watch, go ahead, but for most people I would say not to bother.",2019-10-08T04:30:26.368Z,4.0,In the Tall Grass,2019
523139,The Movie Diorama,"In The Tall Grass is overgrown with flimsy dialogue and a premise that needed landscaping. Stephen King seems to have an endless amount of material to adapt. So much so, that his son is mimicking the footsteps of his father by also writing horror-related fiction. When the two generations joined together to write a novella on a mysterious field, it should’ve harked back to King’s legacy as the legendary writer he once was. Sadly though, despite the faithfulness to the source material, it’s yet another King story unable to translate comprehensibly into a full-length feature. Two siblings, with one six months pregnant, stop outside an old church and venture into an endless field of tall grass when they hear a child yearning for help. This field however is enshrouded with a mysterious force that prevents anyone who enters from leaving, and so the two must survive the oddities of the tall grass before “something” or “someone” endangers them.

Massive ‘Triangle’ vibes from this story, except its conceptual complexities are less innovative and more mundane. Past, present and future selves are lurking within the swaying echoes of the tall grass, conveniently outlining the rules and boundaries of the field’s power. “The grass won’t move dead things” states an embattled young boy, whom had been lost for days. “The rock is the way out!”. Paradoxical in nature, this story had the capacity to be both atmospheric and tense, given the frustratingly claustrophobic environment. Alas, was not meant to be. Despite Wrobleski’s stunning cinematography that encapsulated the natural order of the field through stylised motion, particularly when visualising the field to be a living entity of its own, Natali’s one-dimensional screenplay forced certain characters actions and personalities to be questionably dull.

The extent of characterisation can only be surmised by the pitch at which they shout for each other. For example, Cal continually shouting “Becky? Becky? Becky with the good hair!?” is the maximum capacity at which we feel for his character. Becky then shouts for “Cal!”. Travis waltzes on in and shouts for “Becky?” and “Tobin!”. Ross is just shouting at himself about real estate. His wife is the most expendable individual with nearly zero lines (shouting included!). And the dog had more screen presence than the majority of characters. The dialogue felt inorganic, starkly contrasting the entire premise. Yes, the performances were all functional with what the actors were given, although Wilson as always goes above and beyond. But it’s not enough to carry a supernatural mystery that seeks to explain everything almost immediately. Unable to classify it as a horror, considering there was no legitimate threat/tension, although some eye-wincing gore was well-utilised.

The third act commences and the plot’s lunacy ramped up from confusion to diabolically non-sensical. Without spoiling it, stuff happens near a rock that resembled an incarnate of King’s worst tendencies in fictional writing. Unnecessary “creatures” are added into the mix, ironically adding nothing to the story. Then, as all films featuring time loops end, the characters miraculously close the loop before it even happened. So, what’s the point? Did they honestly learn anything from this ordeal to which they hadn’t actually experienced? Urgh.

It’s abundantly clear that Natali was unable to stretch King’s novella into a feature-length film, despite being a faithful adaptation. The technical excellence was dimmed by flimsy writing and limited characterisation that forced this supernatural mystery to be anything but mysterious. This is why we should all purchase a portable lawnmower, you never know when you’ll be stuck eternally in a field with a giant ancient rock in the middle...",2020-01-16T13:37:45.425Z,4.0,In the Tall Grass,2019

While the film excels in atmosphere, acting, and cinematography, it struggles with logical consistency and leaves many questions unanswered about its characters and central mystery. Despite its narrative flaws, the film effectively explores themes of time loops and choices, maintaining suspense and psychological intrigue throughout.

A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge is the runt of the Elm Street litter. It was unfortunate to be the sequel to a landmark horror film, a film that birthed one of the ultimate horror icons whilst having at its core a terrifying premise. A premise that was superbly executed by all involved in the first film. Part 2 bravely tried to advance the bogeyman story to another level, to one of possession, which in hindsight was a mistake.

There's also the mixed tonal flow and confused intents that hamper the pic. Whilst the young members of the cast are too blank to garner the required amount of sympathy to get us to care about their plight, especially lead lad Mark Patton as Jesse Walsh. However, there is still a lot to like here, some striking imagery grabs the attention and it is not without some unnerving scares.

9796,John Chard,"Brazil Nuts!

After their bus crashes while touring in Brazil, a group of young adults find themselves in a world of misery...

Not ever likely to be watched by members of the Brazilian Tourist Board, Turistas (AKA: Paradise Lost) is a whole mixed bag of a movie. Narratively it has been done before, a bunch of pretty types end up coming face to face with criminals and psychopaths in a land they don't know and barely understand.

The build up to the horror elements is slow, and for some horror fans it takes too long. Yet conversely it's good that the makers have afforded time for the characterisations to build, allowing for some humour, some drama and an insight into a multi national group dynamic. You may not much care what happens to them, but at least you know them!

Actually filmed on location in Brazil, there's a lot of mother nature's natural beauty (and her tough terrain at times) on show, all neatly photographed by Enrique Chediak (28 Weeks Later/127 Hours). However, the trump card is the underwater sequences, which are superbly put together, including a thrilling extended chase sequence that lifts the film out of horror/thriller averageville.

There's messages in the mix that valiantly try to make a point, but they get lost as things go a bit cuckoo. Yet there's enough good craft on show, and a horror sequence guaranteed to make you squirm, to make this worth a viewing. It is a good bit better than what some of the hate poured on it suggests, though the caveat is that horror fans should know it only gets into horror territory late in the day. 6/10",2015-10-18T12:01:30.648Z,6.0,Turistas,2006

49730,s6kx,"This artistic masterpiece is unfortunately undervalued. Unfortunately, Warner Bros. Entertainment does not know its worth, and due to their lack of interest in it, it has become obscure. This artistic masterpiece must be revived again. Warner Bros. Entertainment must do this, just as 20th Century Fox did when it released two improved releases of the Titanic movie in 2003 and 2012. Who would believe that a movie released in 1997 is now available in 4K quality and 3D technology?! Warner Bros. Entertainment must re-release the movie trailer in 4K quality as a first step to correct its course, and launch a new strong marketing campaign for the Red Riding Hood movie, just as it launched a strong marketing campaign for the Barbie movie that does not deserve it. They should do this for the movie that deserves it, not the opposite. Essentially, the reason for the lack of fame of the Red Riding Hood movie was the failure of Warner Bros. Entertainment in its marketing campaign for the movie, as it was a very weak campaign, in addition to its excessive pursuit of the PG-13 age rating instead of accepting its R-rating, which led to changing the ending for the PG-13 rated cut. The reason was not the movie itself or the director Catherine Hardwicke. In fact, Catherine Hardwicke directed the movie in an unimaginable way, especially in the unrated original cut of the movie known as the Alternate Cut. The existence of a rated cut without additional terms such as (Alternate Cut) does not necessarily mean that it is the original cut. In fact, the original cut is the one that was not modified to fit the PG-13 age rating. The original cut is the one that was released as is without modifications. The original cut is the one that the MPAA did unrate, so you always find the word Unrated next to it. The original cut is the Alternate Cut, and it was not named Director's Cut because Warner Bros. Entertainment changed the ending of the PG-13 rated cut to fit the PG-13 age rating. Therefore, it is no longer possible to name the original cut as Director's Cut, as this title does not include the change in the ending. Therefore, they had to name the original cut as the Alternate Cut to include the change in the ending. As you know, production companies do not like the R-rating because it narrows the audience range, which reduces revenues. Therefore, Warner Bros. Entertainment pressured Catherine Hardwicke to modify the movie to be released with a PG-13 age rating instead of an R-rating. This explains why the ending was changed in the rated cut compared to the unrated original cut. In my opinion, both cuts are successful artistic masterpieces, but the original cut is more artistically successful, and I loved it more. My rating for the rated cut (modified) is 9/10, and my rating for the unrated original cut (Alternate Cut) is 10/10. It is the best and greatest of all time in presenting the story of Red Riding Hood, and no movie surpasses it in presenting this story.

416234,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**A movie as empty as a haunted house.**

I fully understand the fascination with Winchester Mystery House, an old mansion that was born from Sarah Winchester's will and ideas: owner of a fortune linked to the firearm's industry, she thought she was being haunted by the ghosts of people killed by these weapons and was advised by a medium to live in a mansion that was always being remodeled, with rooms and divisions permanently being added or demolished in an apparently random way. Sarah Winchester truly believed that she would be killed if she stopped or finished the building, so the house was only completed (obviously unended) with her death, and then opened to the public as a tourist attraction. It's a fascinating, curious and bizarre story, but it took a long time to reach the cinema.

The movie, however, is not remarkable, being just another ghost story in a haunted house. The Spierig Brothers (directors and writers) do not bring anything new to their film, limiting themselves to using almost all the regular clichés of American horror, including static and scary images that appear out of nowhere (at quite predictable moments) for the usual jump scares. As a haunted house horror movie, I've seen better.

One of the biggest problems of the film is the poor script and the bad conception of the characters. The two brothers who wrote the script were so enamored with the mysterious house that they weren't able to create a really intriguing story around it, and its original inhabitant. Everything goes reasonably well from the point where the doctor arrives at the mansion, but the preceding story, which justifies his trip and stay at the place, is very far-fetched. On the other hand, the melodramatic twist at the end, involving the doctor and a ghost from his past, was predictable from the beginning and is very nauseating. Poorly written and almost without personality, the characters just appear, talk and disappear without our caring about them. And as if the truth were not enough to make us believe in the possible curse of the Winchester family, the script got a completely made up story for Marion Marriott, niece (and heiress) of the manor owner. She existed in real life, but her life wasn't what the movie says, and her husband didn't die as it is said. It is a pointless and unnecessary invention.

The cast has a handful of familiar names, but maybe they don't really want to be remembered for the work they've done here. In fact, the cast effort is reduced, and the prevailing feeling is that the actors were not really committed or motivated. If Helen Mirren is the most seasoned and famous actress in the cast, the truth is that she is never really there, in body and mind. She seems oblivious, or uninterested. Jason Clarke still seems to have some interest in what he's doing, and I felt the actor tried to do something positive, but he won't have had much of an opportunity to go beyond what he's done.

The film is not a technical brilliance. There have been attempts to film in the original house, but we are told that the very design of the house, with cramped spaces and low light, will not be ideal for movie shooting. Personally, I also believe that the organization that is managing the property has shown some reluctance to allow it, since they have always had, until today, great restraint in allowing the capture of images of the interior of the house. Everything that was recreated in the studio seems to me to be very well done, and I liked the sets and the house. However, the production values ​​basically stop here… the cinematography is pretty basic and the editing is banal, but it manages to give the film a pace that isn't tiresome. The props and period details look convincing, but the CGI is poor, the digitally made images are of very poor quality, and the visual and sound effects seem cheap and elementary.",2022-07-29T23:13:51.009Z,2.0,Winchester,2018

My Bloody Valentine is directed by Patrick Lussier and collectively written by Zane Smith, Todd Farmer and John Beaird. It stars Jensen Ackles, Jaime King, Kerr Smith, Kevin Tighe and Tom Atkins. Music is by Michael Wandmacher and cinematography by Brian Pearson
 
A remake of George Mihalker’s 1981 slasher, the 2009 version was released in a blaze of 3D frenzy, where it absolutely coined it in at the World’s box offices. It’s not hard to see why, for no matter how much we may moan about remakes and the general languid nature of slashers turned out just for coin, there’s a big market out there for them. As it happens this isn’t half bad, oh it’s all very familiar, there’s another Michael Myers clone stalking the residents of some American town and offing them in gruesome ways. Here the perp is The Miner, dressed up in his work clothes, armed with a pickaxe, face covered by a gas mask that in turn makes him creepy looking and gives him Darth Vader breathing exercises to do. 
 
The mystery element is that this new series of murders are being re-enacted from crimes ten years previously, so is the old killer back from the dead, or is there a copycat at large? Enter troubled teenagers, townsfolk acting suspiciously and mucho blood and screaming sitting in tandem together. There’s the requisite amount of nudity, including one of the longest nude scenes ever, while Lussier shows a good knack for blending humour with the terror. The 3D is of a high standard, and the sound mix is incredible, this really is one to give your sub-woofer a work out. It pans out as expected, but it manages to eek out good suspense for its finale and having Atkins and Tighe in the movie is a reassuring presence.
 
The original was no great film anyway, and although this is better, it’s still just a bunch of acting props being killed in different ways. But it is effective and above all else it’s fun. 7/10",2013-11-30T02:06:20.568Z,7.0,My Bloody Valentine,2009

The heir of a mine (Jensen Ackles) in a remote town in Pennsylvania returns ten years after a Valentine’s Day massacre that took the lives of 22 people. When a psycho slayer dressed as a miner with a pickaxe also shows up the sheriff (Kerr Smith) naturally suspects the heir, who happens to be the ex-beau of his wife (Jaime King). 

""My Bloody Valentine"" (2009) is a remake of the 1981 slasher but is different enough to view as a sort-of sequel. It includes most of the vital elements for an effective flick of this genre.

The basic formula was well established by ""Halloween"" (1978) and the first two ""Friday the 13th"" flicks (1980-1981): A crazy masked killer and a group of youths in a specific environment, whether a town, camp, forest, college, resort, building, etc. In this case it's a mining town, shot in Kittanning and Bethel, PA, and points nearby along the Allegheny River. So the film gets a big plus for filming somewhere other than friggin’ British Columbia! (Not that there's anything wrong with BC, of course, but enough is enough).

Beautiful women is a must for these types of films and ""My Bloody Valentine"" delivers superbly with Jaime King (Sarah), Megan Boone (Megan) and Betsy Rue (Irene), the latter in an extended nude scene, which I think is unnecessary, but some will obviously appreciate it.

Most importantly, the story is engrossing and keeps you guessing as to the identity of the killer till the very end. Compared to the original movie, it’s more compelling and all-around more entertaining.

I basically gave this a shot because Sarah Snook looked cute and it was a horror movie I hadn't heard about.  I had really expected it to get a lot better from there.  Sadly it doesn't.

The opening sequence is an odd choice, but it's just a mechanic to get her in a wheelchair, which I really wanted to love, but it is used a cheap way to debilitate her and add to a fear of helplessness when it sort of does the opposite.  As someone who has had to use a wheelchair before, it separates the character from most of the audience because they don't have that frame of reference: it's alienating usually.  The movie has to be really good and draw the audience to relate to the character before they can overlook things that seem foreign to them.

There are some really good sequences with the ghost, and it actually reminded me of ""Evil Dead"" quite a bit, but it did sort of devolve into what looks like two girls mud wrestling, so I'm hoping that wasn't a factor.

The story is all jumbled and clunky in how it's told so it ruins all the parts that would make it interesting, but even with a good mystery / twist, I think the movie would have been average at best, and instead it's a waste of time.

9030,RalphRahal,"The Eye had the potential to be a gripping psychological horror, but it fell short in depth and originality. The plot follows a familiar formula without bringing much new to the table, making it predictable despite some intriguing moments. The directing is solid, with well-timed transitions and a smooth shift into the second act. Cinematography stands out in certain scenes, especially with the contrast between reality and visions, and small production details show attention to realism. However, while the visuals are effective, they don't fully compensate for the film’s lack of emotional weight.

Jessica Alba’s performance is serviceable but lacks the intensity needed to carry a psychological horror film. She maintains the same on-screen presence she’s known for, but it doesn’t elevate the script, which already struggles with depth. The supporting cast does a decent job, though no one truly stands out. The script itself feels basic, relying on surface-level tension rather than digging into the psychological aspects of the story. The sound design helps build atmosphere, but it doesn’t leave a lasting impact. Overall, The Eye is watchable with good production value and some eerie moments, but it doesn’t push boundaries or leave a strong impression.",2025-02-08T17:04:00.186Z,4.0,The Eye,2008

I also understand that, for an audience expecting an engaging, supernatural, or entertaining horror movie, this might come across as particularly bizarre and eccentric. Moreover, it's a horror comedy, and horror comedies are often not well-received. In this case, it's a horror comedy that takes a distinctly grotesque and disturbing turn. I put myself in the shoes of someone watching this movie for the first time without any prior knowledge. The second half disorients you. You laugh, yes, but it's one of those nervous laughs, and you think, 'What the hell am I watching?' And the ending. That damn ending. It's a good ending, doesn’t it? The protagonist survives, so everyone should be satisfied, right?
But who wouldn’t feel terrible for the protagonist?This horror comedy is much, much more than it might seem at first glance.
The protagonist comes across as a jerk, selfish, unlikable, ambitious, indifferent—call him what you will. You expect him to suffer.
But damn, what he goes through isn’t the usual punishment like a 'Saw'-style slasher gore. It’s something much worse. But there’s something good in it. His 'dehumanization,' in some way, restores his dignity. He’s more human now than he was at the start of the movie. It works better than any of Saw's traps.The only downside: I’ve heard that Kevin Smith intends to make a sequel, where the protagonist (rehumanized) might become the 'villain' in turn.

While the main premise of the movie is awesome - a serial killer living in the middle of nowhere that obsesses over turning people into a walrus - the movie falls short of being a new ""human centipede"" due to the poor execution. Cheap pitiful ""humor"" to try to mask the terrible acting, pathetic soundtrack that annoys more than aclimate the viewer, and ok but unimpressive photography that does not compensate the boring and sometimes stupid dialogs in the movie.

The cherry on the cake was the ending, that in the last 10min of the movie seemed to be converging into a good ending, but ended up in the most unrealistic and absurd sequence of the whole movie.

439079,Mark Rushow,"Overall I liked The Nun it was a spooky fun movie with some pretty good shots and scenes (lighting, camera angles, and such). The transitions from one scene to another was a bit off and the story overall had a more fantasy tone over the more grounded and realistic tone The Conjuring and Annabelle movies had. Much of the story felt like it was just forced to setup a shot or scene which does hurt it. It isn't a perfect movie but I'd watch it again. It is like Indiana Jones meets Silent Hill. None of the character actors felt out of place or superficial either, I really appreciate that. Everyone felt believable and natural to their roles and environment, not forced.",2018-09-14T02:13:39.111Z,8.0,The Nun,2018

And with a vengeance.

The Nun is not for people that don’t like horror movies or burnt out on them. Don't expect character development either. Don't expect to be shock like you were when you watched The Exorcist. I’ve read several critic reviews were they just don’t get it. They use words to describe it like “using every trick in the horror trope” or “predictable”, “throwing the kitchen sink at”, or “not enough character development”. Well forget what you heard because there is more bite to this movie than you’d expect. 

Okay, so we begin with a spooky opening sequence where two nuns are fighting to save humanity from a malevolent presence that is about to enter our world. One is dragged into a room and the other commits suicide by hanging. Suicide is a sin, right? Makes you wonder what type of evil is powerful enough to destroy Catholic nuns?

Being the beginning of The Conjuring movie universe, this story begins like this, Father Burke (Demién Bichir) is summoned by the Vatican to investigate the suicide of a nun at The Abbey, a castle located somewhere in Romania. Apparently Father Burke has a trauma and a shameful past after having failed to save a teen from an exorcism he performed. Makes you wonder why The Vatican would send a priest like Father Burke on such a dangerous mission. The Vatican doesn’t send Father Burke alone on this task though. They assign Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), who hasn’t yet taken her vows. A nun that hasn't taken her vows yet, and not your typical nun either. She's contrary to the average nun. She seems so innocent.

Father Burke and Sister Irene are taken to The Abbey by a local delivery man, Frechie (Jonas Bloquet). (You may remember Frenchie as the first exorcism performed by The Warrens from the original The Conjuring. Lorraine Warren has the painting of The Nun at their home and references it in the film.) Sister Irene was chosen to go on this assignment because she experiences visions, these visions provide the information needed to uncover what actually occurred at The Abbey.

The Abbey has been the site of a malevolent force locked away for centuries. The Church took over The Abbey and placed a congregation of nuns to pray 12 hours a day to keep the evil force in control. However, after WW2 bombing weaken the structure of The Abbey, the evil locked inside of it found another way to escape, and using the guise of a nun, slowly grows in strength causing terror on those around it. 

Yes, The Nun is a supernatural survival horror installment of The Conjuring universe. You don’t have to be a die hard fan of the horror genre in order to be scared. Yes, there is a lot of the same tropes from the most popular supernatural horror movies and that is because this is how demonic infestation happens. 
Director Corin Hardy and screenplay writer Gary Dauberman do wonderfully.

What this film gives us is tricky camera and visual effects that showcase how the demon works. We find out that the demon’s name is Valak–an ancient demon from Hell that was summoned by the count performed sacrificial rituals. 
If you are expecting character development then you’re not going to find it here. This story doesn’t need a lot of characters at all. You don’t need a lot of information about these characters because Valak is the only character this story is about.. One minute he’s behind the character’s back, the next his shadow appears on the wall, he reanimates dead corpses and even manifesting animals and the usual superhuman strength as well as taking on human form. He ghosts the characters as well. It’s always interesting to see how the director and screenwriter pull off these visual effects. 

Father Burke character plays like a detective searching the castle for any information he can use to exorcise the demonic spirit from the world while Sister Irene uses her visions to lead her to the truth about what occurred at The Abbey as well as discover anything that she can use to send the evil spirit back to Hell. If you like Ash from the Evil Dead horror series, then you’ll like Frenchie because he is the outsider in all of this providing necessary dark humor. Frenchie isn’t afraid to use a shotgun to blow off the heads of a couple of deadites disguised as nuns.

What also makes this film enjoyable to watch with a group, is the pacing. There are enough slow moments for you to make jokes about the characters or the visual bombarding your senses.

I give this film an enthusiastic 7/10 for its creepy mood and intense disturbing images. And those squeamish people, no worries. There isn't a lot of gore. 

Definitely a great popcorn horror flick to watch in the dark with your friends. Definitely worth the movie ticket. You won't be disappointed as long as you keep what I've said in this review in mind.

When a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania takes her own life, a priest with a haunted past and a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate...

So here we have the latest spin-off from the one time high quality ""Conjuring"" franchise. Sticking strictly to a formula that will either infuriate or satiate horror genre fans, ""The Nun"" delivers enough creepy boo-jump tropes to keep it above average. There's plenty of roaming about dark corridors and churchyards, with lanterns our only prominent saviours from the terrors of the dark. If, and it's a big if, you don't mind that Corin Hardy's film isn't trying to raise the bar for horror, and is in fact staying safe, then there's a decent enough good time to be had here. If you be one of those who constantly moans about bringing nothing new to the table, don't bother with this one, in fact, think of something new to bring to the table yourselves then... 

The set-pieces hold up well enough (buried alive shiver shiver), the atmospheric dread only occasionally punctured by Abel Korzeniowski's bombastic score. The story is interesting enough, such as why the entity is bringing terror to the abbey, what is the link to the ""Warren"" family, and the backstory axis for Father Burke (Demián Bichir) brings another demonic layer to the plotting. While talking about ""bringing something new to the table"", for the first time in this series we actually get a bit of humour, mostly from Jonas Bloquet's likable Frenchie character. Taissa Farmiga holds the lead well, where she has a very appealing visual reaction style that will serve her well if she stays in genre mode. While Maxime Alexandre's cinematography (low lights and fogs) is a big improvement from ""Annabelle: Creation"" and is tonally compliant.

This formula has been done much better previously, such as Hammer's take on ""The Woman In Black"", but even then they were going on about new stuff being brought to the table etc etc etc. It is what it is, a boo-jump haunted house (buildings) picture that is there for those who like such things, who buy into it on that level. Is this a great film? Absolutely not, but it works on its intended terms and any expectation of a new branch of horror is going to have you crying over spilt blood. 6/10",2019-10-07T15:40:13.179Z,6.0,The Nun,2018

Demián Bichir, Taissa Farmiga (surname makes sense, I did think that she looked like Vera) and Jonas Bloquet aren't the worst actors to follow, in fact I didn't mind them, but their performances and their characters are equally forgettable. No-one else makes a mark onscreen.

How Valak is portrayed is the issue, the close-ups really do take the creep factor away - same can be said for when the demons speak too, that village idiot line is very out of place. I do approve that The Nun moves about though, which is better than it largely staying still - à la <em>'Annabelle'</em>. Longer shots and more silence would've done wonders.

This has such a fucking weak beginning, like what is the relevance to the blonde bimbo being around and literally has no point to the rest of the movie whatsoever. Apart from being one of those cunts who says “Hey, wait a second” as you’re about to leave then instead of giving the burning words, says “never mind.” You never find out, I doubt it was Oscar worthy or chocolate filled coins worthy but still fucking irritating.

Also I did not have any forewarning about the genital mutilation in this movie, well almost. Like if movies are going to do this to me can you PLEASE advertise it better so I can avoid at all costs because it makes me want to die.

OKAY. So freshman lady spots this activist guy and seems that he tickles her fancy as she instantly becomes a fully interested activist and thinks fuck it I’ll go risk my life in the middle of fuck knows where with all of these random people that think I’m a sheltered suburban fool. I mean she’s even on the wrong side of the leader because his girlfriend has clicked on that our lovely freshman wants to suck his dick resulting in her attendance. These people scream out virgin sacrificing cult at all times.

Really brilliant and wise idea taking these rich white kids out to a deprived area, not asking to be noticed in the slightest are we. One even shouts in clear earshot about child abuse seeing a family carting their trike on a bicycle, skills on how to not get killed are just seriously flawless guys. 

Everything is just painfully obvious and this movie relies 90% on gore, which is actually done extremely well. There’s an eye scene and it’s captured perfectly as if you can watch it without looking away or squirming then maybe you should go join that tribe as you clearly belong there. I mean they just fuck off their belongings and go straight into the jungle unarmed, is anyone really shocked when the plane crashes and they end up in a bucket load of shit? Quite literally when one of them also explodes from the anus which was one of many “and the point of this scene is?” moments. I don’t need to see that in my life you trash.

I did like the nice man who looked like a bumble bee and seemed to be the go to guy if you wanted a body part hacked off for supper, he seemed like he could have moonlighted as a MUA. Had his contours down to a tee. Most of them reacted more offended by the poo scene than seeing eachother being led off one by one for torture, again I will say all of the gore scenes were fucking brutal and do give many points for those. 

Some parts are just a bit fucking stupid, one guy actually has a wank after seeing one of them just being like fuck this and slicing her neck open. Really, a wank. I’m all for the activity but there’s a time and a place and that was not where I imagine I would be feeling the moment can take me. They get the tribe stoned as an escape plan, again I’m not feeling the genius in this bunch? Dare I also mention none think to ever remove their luminous yellow suits, would have thought that would have been a pretty logical thing to do during an escape attempt….

I have enjoyed the Eli Roth's films, even though in some cases I've rated them lower than average rating it had received. But this is not what I was looking for. This is a terror-horror, not actual horror with supernatural or sci-fi viruses. I've learnt the storyline before the watch, but the film was too violent. Even for most of the grown ups. Usually I won't feel a thing for film tortures, because 'fake' is the word always pops up in my mind whenever I see gore.

Anyway, these days, killings in the films are considered entertainment. There is a separate group of fans who follow this kind of theme. But for me, the cannibalism was the one most disturbed. I have no issue with killings, but cannibalism brings totally uneasy. The story was decent, but intentional. You would guess most of the parts. But this film was not about that, just to make you go off of your seat with discomfortable and it succeeds on that.

It was totally opposite to 'Embrace of the Serpent'. It was inspired by the 80s Italian film with the similar storyline. The film was about fighting for the survival of passengers after their plane got crashed in the Amazon forest who are now hunted by Amazon tribes. There's already a sequel on making titled 'Beyond the Green Inferno'. I don't think so, it is a recommendable film, but some are doing that for fun, and some to challenge their friends. Overall, a decent production, with casting, locations and visuals. But I won't favour it.

346910,Gimly,"My mind was racing as I watched _The Predator_ in the cinema tonight. I'd heard virtually nothing good about it so my anxious brain kicked into overdrive the whole time the film was going on. As a result of that, I almost feel like I experienced three movies in that theatre. First, obviously the movie on the screen. Secondly, the awesome movie I was theorising could unfurl at the result of each new sequence and plot point, but that sadly never did. And thirdly, the inexcusably awful and franchise-ruining movie that I feared it was about to take a hard left turn into at any minute, and thankfully never did.

And that's really my experience on _The Predator_ overall, and the reason for a stalemate ""2.5 outta 5"" review: It wasn't as good as it should have been, it wasn't as bad as it could have been. Unfortunately, when the movie I'm writing in my head alongside watching it is better than what's actually on screen, when you take into account that I'm an unimaginative, talentless hack, really doesn't cut it for a sequel to _Predator_, one of of only five movies I've ever given a perfect rating to.

The best parts of _The Predator_ are when there is an eponymous Predator on screen. So you might think, ""Oh it's not a good movie, but it's a good _Predator_ movie"", and fair enough a conclusion to draw, but no. Part of the problem is, this movie really could have been pulled off with any aliens at all. Take out the Yautja and replace them with... I dunno, the blue skinned pogo-stick people of Planet Hurfadump, and it can still play out functionally the same. See, although I enjoyed watching the Predators do their thing, there was really nothing beyond cosmetic similarities that made them the Predators we've seen in every movie preceding this one.

I think possibly part of the reason for that is that every other movie with a Predator in it has been an Action Horror movie (albeit Action Horror with ever-increasing Sci-Fi elements from film to film) whereas _The Predator_ is an Action Comedy, just one with some gore. Now I don't think that taking it that route was necessarily and... abysmal failure, let's say, but was Action Comedy the **best** way to take the _Predator_ franchise? I think it's pretty clear that the answer is no.

Ironic that that direction is being taken by Shane Black, the man who has a history with _Predator_ purely because the crew of the first film were determined to have him to work on the script, which he refused. Now here we are more 30 years later and Shane Black finally **has** put his name on a Predator movie, and it's not even good.

The hopes were high for this latest Predator rebirth, not because Shane Black starred in the great first Predator film, so therefore he surely must care about the project? But because he's an excellent writer and director. Shane Black can count Lethal Weapon(S), The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight on his CV, he was the man who put Iron Man back on track after the sag of part 2. Plus he is the creator of two of the best buddy buddy neo-noirs this millennium (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang/The Nice Guys), So how come The Predator stinks of lazy cash cow manure?

Plot in a nutshell sees the universe's most lethal hunters unleashed on Earth due to the meddling of a soldiers kid and some nosey scientist types. The fate of mankind rests with a group of damaged ex-soldiers and a rather cheesed off female scientist.

We have a rehash mishmash of what we have seen before in Predator 87 and Predators 2010. A group dynamic fighting a seemingly invincible foe. The subsequent science aspects such as human DNA inference/reasoning etc never really add up to much, serving only for a bunch of standard actors shouting, swearing and spouting hopelessly weak jokes and series re-treads. When you think the pic is about to up a gear, get rivetingly dramatic, a poor slice of humour comes our way either by vocal spillage or visual drivel (puppy pet Predator dog, really?). There's a bunch of plot threads that just dangle never to be pulled (PTSD/our hero's family strife et al), and the Predators loose on Earth - with different agendas - are confusingly shifted about by a screenplay not sure where it wants to land. 

Plus points? Well the cinematography is superb (Larry Fong), and you can't fault this for action quotas, there's plenty of it and it's bloody (both red and green type). The score is the traditional one we had from Alan Silvestri back in the 87 film, in fact it hardly deviates from it and yet Henry Jackman gets the credit. Of course some of the jokes will work for some folk (I would be lying if I said a Whoopi Goldberg gag didn't make me laugh), but the terror has gone, these Predators are no longer scary creatures. This reeks of a troubled production going hand in hand with a cash cow that not only narratively adds up to nothing really, but of a franchise death knell.

Unlike the clueless reviewer (on a different website) who I quoted in the headline, I will not proceed to write 5 paragraphs of meaningless drivel about a movie I hate.

Usually all of the AvP movies, Alien, Predator and the cross overs are at least a solid 3.5 stars. Of course the original Alien trilogy as well as Predator 1, 2 and even Predators stand out as being very original. The difference between the originals and the spin-offs is clearly the tone they set. In this movie we get a comic book style presented, with by no means bad CGI (dogs looked more real than in Predators for example), a secret research conspiracy, and charismatic heroes getting slaughtered (or not, no spoilers). Just like in the graphic novels, the pace is neck breaking. The ending felt almost rushed, to introduce the new Predator Killer Weapon. It is understandable how regular movie goers are put off by the constant over-stimulation, but I would not want it any other way. The action is over the top, definitely. But there was great attention to detail how the action scenes played out exactly, as opposed to lesser action films in which a flurry of cuts leaves a thinking audience just confused about what just happened.

Sure, I would have loved a darker vibe throughout the film too, especially in the beginning the score reminded a little of a Disney orchestra playing. But ""The Predator"" was a hell of a ride and deserves a special place among the spin-offs.

I still can't believe I'm about to write a review for The New Mutants... The last X-Men movie before they're introduced into the MCU became one of the most delayed films ever, but it finally got released this week. Shot in 2017 with an original release date of April 2018, Josh Boone had reshoots planned, which postponed the movie for the first time. Disney began negotiations to merge with 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios), keeping the film in a limbo state. A global pandemic emerged, pushing the movie even further. Final outcome: a worldwide limited release three years after finishing shooting, and without any reshoots. So, obviously, my expectations were pretty low...

Surprise, surprise, The New Mutants isn't a horrible mess, it's... fine! I feel really sorry that so many people worked on this film and had to wait so long to see it being released to the world. I love how it's far from being just another generic, formulaic superhero flick. Sure, it has tons of cliches, and it does still feel like an X-Men movie at times, but I'll get there. I genuinely appreciate that Boone and Knate Lee wrote a narrative packed with significant and detailed character development, including a compelling romantic arc. Every young mutant gets their own story explained front-center. Each time the film dives into a character's past, it never feels like an irrelevant subplot. It all serves a purpose.

The technical crew had a very low budget to work with compared to other movies in the genre, so I must praise them for transforming a small, one-location film into something surprisingly entertaining. The visual effects definitely don't have that quality that viewers are used to seeing now, but they're reasonably okay for the most part. The horror atmosphere is definitely present, but it feels like the movie could have benefited from a more assertive, bolder approach to these nightmarish sequences. The best aspect of the whole film is related to the indisputably talented cast, with just one exception...

From Anya-Taylor Joy's rebel behavior to Charlie Heaton's experienced performance, passing through Maisie Williams' emotional display and Henry Zaga's charming one-liners, every one of these actors proves why they were cast in such a well-known franchise. Despite the ridiculously flawed accents, all share great chemistry between each other, including debutant Blu Hunt. However, the latter fails to be a compelling protagonist clearly due to her inexperience. I don't want to be too harsh on her because I did see some great moments when she shared the screen with her colleagues. However, I do need to state that every scene where she acts alone or against a green screen reaches cringe-worthy levels of bad acting.

Boone and/or the casting crew must also take responsibility for choosing her as the main character, but honestly, she's not even my main issue. That has to do with her own character. While she gets the same focus as her fellow mutants when it comes to her backstory, she never really has to deal with her powers' consequences. Some mutants hurt or killed people, and they're unquestionably damaged because of it. Dani doesn't have a single moment where she feels sorry for whatever happened in her past or where she's confronted with it. It's quite hard to connect with a protagonist when both the character and the actress playing her lack that captivating personality.

Finally, Alice Braga, as the doctor, is probably the most formulaic component of the movie. From the first conversation she has with the mutants, any viewer can guess where the story is going. Braga is good as Dr. Cecilia Reyes, but coincidentally or not, her character is the only one whose backstory wasn't remotely explored. Reyes' motivations and what lies beyond the hospital raise intriguing questions that, unfortunately, never get answered. Maybe the supposed reshoots could have solved some of these issues, perhaps they could have added some more. I don't know for sure, but what I do know is that The New Mutants is far from being an awful mess.

All in all, Josh Boone and Knate Lee deliver a reasonably entertaining screenplay out of the generic zone of the superhero genre, packed with detailed character development and decent horror sequences, especially having in mind the low budget. The New Mutants features a marvelous cast, where everyone shares tremendous chemistry with each other. All actors deliver great performances, except for the debutant Blu Hunt who unfortunately lets her inexperience overcome her evident potential. Contrasting with the overall character treatment, Dani Moonstar fails to be a compelling protagonist since she's barely shown having to deal with the emotional consequences of her powers like every other mutant does. Despite the refreshing take on the overall story, there are still a few cliches and formulaic components throughout the film, especially related to the hospital. Overall, it's surprisingly okay considering the numerous production issues, so I definitely recommend it at least just to say goodbye to the last X-Men installment pre-MCU.

340102,SWITCH.,"Just like 'Dark Phoenix', Fox's greatest loss is Disney's greatest gain: even as 'The New Mutants' opened, the discussion was already focused on how Disney's MCU is bound to resuscitate 'X-Men'. That's a shame because Josh Boone's relic from a defunct franchise, unceremoniously dumped in cinemas in the middle of pandemic, was a step in a potentially interesting new direction.

340102,NerdyPopcorn,"The problem with The New Mutants is that it fails in so many different areas that's its difficult to pin point why it's such a bad movie. If you're a X-Man fan you'll be disappointed by the main characters mutations, if you're a thriller fan you'll be disappointed by the villain.

**When to watch:** The only scenario I would recommend you watch this movie is if you are die hard fan of one of the actors (Even still you might be disappointed)

**How to fix this movie:**

1. Replace the villain, stop trying to make this a weird horror crossover and focus on what made X-Man good to begin with. A PROPER VILLAIN.
2. Far to much focus on the poorly written backstory for each main character.
3. Make the Mutations better! The super powers should make the audience want to be them.
4. Cut the cheesy dialogue and pick a clear genre, this is a toss up between, Sci-Fi, Action, Horror, Romance, Cheesy B Level Movie.",2020-11-16T18:02:04.768Z,1.0,The New Mutants,2020
340102,Repo Jack,"As both a horror and X-men fan, I was looking forward to this mashup since the first trailer dropped. Even recently with mostly bad reviews and press, I wanted to see it for myself. 

And ... it pretty much sucked. That doesn't bode well for future work from Josh ""The Fault in my Stars"" Boone (e.g. ""The Stand"" mini-series. 

We pretty much know the gist from the trailers. Young mutants are haunted/harassed by something in a mental hospital. 

The best parts are pulled from the X-men series in which mutants first find out their powers, typically represented effectively on screen. Most times these scenes are fun, but the special effects are a mixed bag, jumping back and forth from decent to cheesy. 

Most of the ensemble cast are relatively new up-and-coming stars such as Maise Williams (""Game of Thrones""), Anya Taylor-Joy (""The Witch/Queen's Gambit""), and Charlie Heaton (""Stranger Things"") but the acting is mediocre, and worst of all, they butcher whatever accent they are supposed to have (Irish, Russian[?], and U.S. southern respectively). 

And the story -- disappointing to say the least.

I thought they were ruining ""The New Warriors"", my mistake, and I didn't realize they gender bent a character I was already familiar with.  (Moonstar is basically another guy character from ""The Initiative"" in Marvel Comcs)

What is really interesting, and NEVER ADDRESSED is what the facility is, who runs it, and what the point is.  There just aren't answers to be had so simply during an uprising.  Honestly worst part of the movie, but unless you're paying too much attention, you probably won't even notice.

The characters are deceptively interesting, to the point where I was actually surprised at certain points, but they are what makes the movie.  The discovery of the characters, they're evolution as a team, and their personal struggles are what makes the movie great.

It is also FILLED with action after a certain point, beautifully rendered and weighted combat with something somewhat meaningful behind it.

Horror is definitely one of my favorite genres. I find this type of film extremely impactful when done right. From sleepless nights to unforgettable images, I can never get enough of horror. However, just like every other popular genre, it reached a point where studios care more about building franchises set on formulaic screenplays than actually delivering original, creative, unique stories. Netflix isn't known for exceptional horror content, so I was skeptical going into this movie.

Things Heard & Seen may hold a generic premise, but Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini are able to add enough substance to make it interesting. Amanda Seyfried (Mank) and James Norton (Little Women) offer two remarkable performances, portraying two distinct characters that somehow ended up together. Both have their own flaws, but the husband is depicted in such a negative manner that it becomes challenging to follow someone so despicable. The main narrative offers a slight twist on the usual ghost story, making it more than just a creepy jumpscare festival, as well as possessing a particularly violent scene that's no short of surprising.

Despite the suspenseful atmosphere, the slow pacing drags an overlong film that unfortunately features an underwhelming ending. The beginning of the third act reaches the peak of excitement, boasting attention-grabbing character decisions that will surely raise the entertainment value. Sadly, the mix of feminist themes with the supernatural narrative is far from getting the right balance, ending as yet another horror flick that had everything to be much, much better.

I'll be honest, I was a little tired when I watched it, but I had a good time.

This is a good movie that I feel could have been a great movie, but I feel like its concept causes a distraction from it's own story.

The movie does some clever things that make it a little hard to not spoil it, but giving the main character debilitations doesn't automatically make her more sympathetic.  I'm sure it makes her more relatable to certain audience and even more realistic a person, as a lot of her characteristics are the result of an unhappy relationship, but it doesn't really drive the story on its own.

Once the momentum of the story, the house, and the characters start to build, the movie really becomes something else.  There seems to be a new trend in movie making, that this story shares, where the story ends and a new story begins.  Its not quite the same as having a 4th act or having 2 3-act stories.  It's close to having a short sequel in the same movie, and that's definitely what it feels like.

283445,Frank Ochieng,"In filmmaker Scott Derrickson’s original ‘Sinister’, this writer’s critical impressions toward the sub-par psychological yarn was rather blunt if not consistent with the steady diet of formulaic fightfests. The following passage pretty much sums up the cinematic sentiments from the movie’s critique:

'At best Sinister is a lukewarm twitchy tale that routinely teases the audience with the obligatory guessing game of whether or not the conjured up evil-minded spookiness is imagined…cheapened scare tactics, an ambiguous monstrous myth, transparent characterizations and a mixed bag of a supernatural storyline barely put any Sinister thoughts in our heads worth contemplating.‘

Well, say what you will about the first ‘Sinister’ outing but it at least had some slight star power in lead Ethan Hawke whose presence was one of the minor pluses in Derrickson’s shoddy shocker. In director Ciaran Foy’s (‘The Citadel’) tingling yet generic ‘Sinister II’, we hardly experience the essence of top-notch horror-induced hedonism. Feverishly flat, the creepily clichéd ‘Sinister II’ continues the tedious tradition of assembling sure-fire goose bump moments yet never really fortifying these mentioned moments with any heft of genuine suspense or titillating intelligence. At best, ‘Sinister II’ skillfully demonstrates its somber shell but horror movies in general, at least ones that strive for sophistication and coherence, should not continuously hide behind the sketchy synthetics of macabre mediocrity.

'Sinister II’ dutifully shares its symbolic connection with its predecessor. For starters, ‘Sinister’ alum James Ransone (the deputy from the first film) returns to the perverse playground while being blessed with a lead role in this frightful follow-up. After his dubious dealings with the Oswalt family in the first film’ where he was part of the police force’ the former law enforcer now works as a private investigator in his continued quest to combat that pesky spirit known as the demon Baghuul. Ransone’s ex-deputy is consumed with the shocking murders that took place previously, so it is his mission to eradicate the further Baghuul-instigated mayhem.

The newest family involved in the menacing mix consists of an Indiana farmhouse containing a mother named Courtney Collins (Shannyn Sossamon) and her two young sons (real-life brothers Dartanain Sloan and Robert Sloan). Unfortunately, Courtney is battling back and forth with her insufferable and indignant husband (Lea Coco) as her poor boys are caught up in the heated drama. The last thing that Courtney needs is a domestic distraction in the farmhouse that incorporates the spookiness of the Baghuul’s mischievousness. Thus, the hapless deputy-turned-PI must do what it takes to prevent the Baghuul from corrupting the psyches of this vulnerable family unit.

The film’s screenplay, written by Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill, plays up to its predictable strengths as the audience is already steeped in the ‘Sinister’ mindset. Unfortunately, the element of mystery and intrigue is already compromised because ‘Sinister II’ does not really leave much second guessing for its titillating tension since it already displayed the same kind of copycat gloom-and-doom blueprint as evidenced in the first installment. In echoing the familiar patterns of eerie scare tactics, this sequel merely mirrors the shady shenanigans found in the first showing that was not that innovative the original time around. Sure, the unsettling imagery does have some warranted punch that leaves somewhat of a horrific impact. The grainy and gruesome home film angle showing a family’s hanging is undoubtedly quite affecting but the shock factor is brief and oddly forgettable. One is left wondering if there are enough tingly tricks up Foy’s desperate sleeve to arm ‘Sinister II’ with more than just drab shadows and twitchy innuendo.

Indeed, ‘Sinister II’ is atmospheric and bleak and does a sure fire job of creating a dank and disturbing universe where the percolating peril steadily brims. However, that is the problem with ‘Sinister II’ as it settles for the surface-base hedonistic haunting without committing to anything morbidly motivating sans the convoluted creepy conventions. Ransone’s bid to expose the imposing beast Baghuul while protecting the fragile welfare of the vulnerable Collins is genuinely a number-by-number plotline that feels stillborn. Even the dastardly Baghuul is stripped of anything particularly mysterious or diabolical for the audience to get on board and become mortified. Resembling a late gray-bluish sandpaper-faced rocker in The Doors’ frontman Jim Morrison with long stringy hair and mod attire, the Baghuul does nothing to really stimulate the gory imagination of ‘Sinister’s movie-making mythology

Little beauty and the rock n' roll attire Beast is something being presented as quite SINISTER. 
Little beauty and the rock n’ roll attire Beast is something being presented as quite SINISTER.
In the long run, ‘Sinister II’ sings a spooky song in many ways but arms its tepid tune with the continued cheap thrills and false jump edits that are so annoyingly common in contemporary creepfests. ‘Sinister’s crime is not so much the calculating presence of a haunt hipster looking to stunt the growth of bewildered housing inhabitants as it is following the pedestrian path of boofests with banal bangs of exhilaration.

The first film was good, I enjoyed it, but not scary. So a sequel was expected and it failed to live up to the standards of the original. I would say, it was a decent horror film, with more story and drama than the creepy atmosphere. One character retained from the previous and the core theme remained, but tried a different method of narration. Something like 'Goodnight Mommy' with two brothers and mystery events surrounding them.

It definitely lacks what a horror film required the most, and predictable too. But the story wise, it was decent, because the actors did a good job. So it is an average film. I expected a better ending and it did not conclude at its best leaving me disappointing. The way it ended might have been the suitable for the story, but I wasn't impressed. Again, another sequel is most certain, so I think this tale is not over yet and chances are very high that the story would follow with the same cast.

It was not a bad flick, but not a follow-up you would have wanted. If you're looking for a genuine horror film, then you should skip it. There's nothing brilliance to appreciate at any level. Overall, I too felt it should have been better in some places. So my advise is if you forget its genre and try to enjoy that you're watching some movie that you don't know its category then surely would have a decent time with it.

I was wrong, Compared to this, the first instalment was a masterpiece and this made me realise how it was successful at achieving its goals sometimes.

'Sinister 2' was quite scary in places. No doubt, the cinema playing the film super loud helped elevate the jump scares though. The creepy depictions of murder in the first film were crazily overdone in this.

The screenplay was terrible. The main story was stale and predictable and the characters were unsympathetic and cold.

The performances were poor all over this film in particularly the ghost children seemed like they were performing a rubbish school pantomime.

71679,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"This movie is the 5th instalment in the Resident Evil series. Why would you want to watch this movie? Why would you want to watch any Resident Evil movie come to think about? Good acting…nope. Intelligent and intriguing plot…absolutely not. Zombies…yep. Action…most definitely yes! Anything else…well if you’re member of the younger part of the average male population you probably watch it for Milla Jovovich as well.

Now that we have established the baseline for the movie, does this movie deliver? The answer to that is, without a doubt, YES! This film delivered exactly what I expected of it. As I mentioned it is the 5th movie in the series and the entire series is sprung from a video game in the first place so it should really be no surprise that the film is one long video game action sequence sporadically interrupted with some dialog. Yet a lot of people seems to expect something else and judges the movie by those expectations.

I think those really low rating are quite unfair. The movie does indeed deliver what I think you should expect. A lot of the action scenes are marvellous. The slow motion scenes are well done and enjoyable unlike some movies where they are just annoying. The zombies and other monsters are good. And yes, I confess that, although I’m hardly among the younger part f the mail audience anymore I do like watching Milla Jovovich jumping around in the scenes in those ridiculous skin tight suits.

If I should complain about anything it would be that I sat through half the movie being annoyed that nobody would get the, painfully obvious, idea to rip that red mind control gizmo off Jill’s chest. When it was finally done in the end it was like “did you really have to take that long to get that idea into your head you dumb bastards”.

I cannot really give the movie a top rating since it does lack much of a story after all but I certainly think it is worth 7 out of 10 stars. I enjoyed myself a lot while watching it. The ending is the usual video-game-movie cliff-hanger and I really hope they make another sequel now when Alice got her powers back.

71679,RalphRahal,"Resident Evil: Retribution (2012) is the point where the franchise fully embraces its identity as a straight-up action spectacle. Any remaining traces of horror are wiped away, making room for relentless fight sequences, wild set pieces, and high-energy pacing. The plot is simple and mostly exists to keep the action moving, but it does introduce some interesting elements, like Ada Wong’s arrival and the expanding influence of Umbrella. That said, while the story has potential, it never really dives deep into anything, keeping everything surface-level.

The directing sticks to Paul W.S. Anderson’s usual style, with slow-motion overload and CGI-heavy action. The cinematography, handled once again by Glen MacPherson, maintains the same hyper-stylized approach as the previous films, and while it looks slick, it can feel repetitive. Editing-wise, it is still messy, but at this point, it is almost a signature of the franchise. Despite its flaws, the movie has some fun sequences, and a few moments hit well, especially in terms of visual spectacle.

Milla Jovovich continues to be the glue holding everything together, bringing the same energy and badassery that keeps these movies watchable. She makes every action scene feel engaging, even when the script does not offer much in terms of depth or dialogue. The soundtrack keeps up the fast-paced, high-energy vibe, fitting the film’s style. While Retribution is far from perfect, and definitely not the best in the series, it is still enjoyable in its own chaotic way.

A couple (Nicole Kidman & Matthew Broderick) moves from the Big Apple to Stepford, Connecticut, where many of the wives of the village are wholly dedicated to their husbands, home & garden and keeping themselves well-groomed and primed for sex. The husband joins the mysterious all-male organization of the town which seems to be up to something fishy. Bette Midler plays Joanna’s best friend while Glenn Close & Christopher Walken are on hand as high society leaders.

“The Stepford Wives” (2004) is a confused comedic remake of the iconic 1975 film. It starts out like it might be a fun farce, and it is to some degree, but it’s hindered by an annoying stereotypical “gay” character and doomed by befuddled writing, the result of bad-management wherein rewrites and reshoots ruined the story's continuity and created plot holes. 

The most glaring example is the implication that the wives are replaced by robots; for instance, one woman is used as an ATM machine. At the end, however, Joanna (Kidman) discovers they've just been brainwashed by microchips inserted in their brains. If the latter is true, why was there an android version of Joanna? Do the men have a choice of a robot model or a human-with-a-microchip model? Do they choose “accessories”? It’s never elucidated. 

The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes, and was shot in Connecticut and New York/New Jersey.

All their neighbours have wives who would vie for the most vacuous woman prize - doting on their looks, their dresses, their hair, their gardens - whilst their men folk, under the watchful eye of ""Mike Wellington"" (Christopher Walker) and his uber-glamorous wife ""Claire"" (Glenn Close) seem to live the life of Reilly. Luckily, ""Bobbie"" (Bette Midler) offers ""Joanna"" the vaguest of lifelines as the only other voice of near sanity in this oasis of feminine perfection, but how long before they succumb too - or can they resist the mysterious effects of the spa and the gentleman's club?

I won't complain about the fact that these kinds of stories were already told about a thousand times. I'm not one of those movie fans who complain about the lack of innovation when it comes to the plot. Honestly, I think most films (especially horror films) out there, share a decent number of similarities and while many reviews comment on the simplicity and unoriginality of the plot, I will mainly focus on the fact that this film is overall not scary, which is my main concern. It seems like The Pang Bros. basically sold their talent to the devil, just to enter in the American film industry, without realizing that there was no need to copy the most superfluous and silly PG-rated contemporary horror flicks. ""The Messengers"" turns out to be one of those movies where nothing really happens...ever. It's just a nice variety of hallucinations and situations that end up being reduced to ""Did it really happen or was it just my imagination?"". No, I'm sorry but I just had about enough with these nonsense. I suppose the real action starts happening during the last twenty minutes, but that just doesn't do it for me. The denouement turns out to be somehow far-fetched and it left me with the hateful ""That's it?"" feeling inside my head. Overall, not the worst movie ever and it's not like it is unwatchable. It happens to be entertaining for moments and it has a small number of well-done ghostly sequences that made the whole thing endurable in some way. I also enjoyed the scenes with the crows, since they reminded me a lot of ""The Birds"", which is like partying with an old best friend, or something like that. The music during the opening and final credits is in my opinion the actual high point and that is not a very good sign, unfortunately. Another thing that is not exactly a good sign, would be the overhead microphone that can be seen more than once during the film.

I actually like Kristen Stewart, and I think she performed decently in this, but she worked her ass off carrying the movie.  John Corbett was the only other person pulling their weight in this movie.

The story itself was okay, but it does have a lot of problems.  My biggest was just their defiance of reality.

The ""in you face"" thing is that the farm is plague with ""crows"" that are clearly ravens.  This is done because you can train ravens much easier, but they're GIANT birds by average comparison of what size birds most people see.  And then they do stupid things like leave feed out far enough away from where you would take it (those are not light bags), and when birds come, he shoos them farther into the car as the trunk is the only part open.

They are planting sunflower seeds, which just means lots of things trying to eat it, but the timeline is all over the place.  They go to plant seeds, and there are tiny plants in the background.  There is an incident early on, then what seems like a week passes, but then it's almost end of harvest.  And then there is still a giant bag of seeds to plant, and it isn't part of the harvest because it's by itself and I don't think they start harvesting during the movie.

There is also the mold which she doesn't seem to know how to treat or why it would come back...just silly.  But its details like these that show how poorly written the script is, especially the dialogue.

The effects are actually pretty interesting, they did a good job on the birds, the wall, and the ""flowing ground"" was really interesting, but it's not enough to have a cool effect or two.  You might as well, just have lots of odd explosions then.

Overall, just not worth the watch, unless you want to see a movie where Kristen Stewart is objectively the best actor.",2020-09-18T02:23:12.114Z,4.0,The Messengers,2007

A troubled family from Chicago (Dylan McDermott, Penelope Ann Miller and Kristen Stewart) moves to the prairie of North Dakota after purchasing a dilapidated farmhouse where they plant a sunflower crop. Unfortunately, the estate’s past interrupts their enjoyment of their new home. John Corbett plays a drifter who hires-on while Dustin Milligan plays the daughter’s potential beau.

“The Messengers” (2007) is a haunted house flick from the Pang brothers of Hong Kong, which is their first American film. The basic set-up is exactly the same as “Cold Creek Manor” (2003) with the difference of a rundown farmhouse substituting for the woodsy manor. From there it throws in elements of “The Grudge” movies mixed with “The Amityville Horror” and “The Birds.” 

While I appreciated the colorful prairie setting, this is easily the least of these because the story is too simplistic and dramatically dull. Fans of Kristen might be interested though; she was 16 during shooting.

The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot at Indian Head and nearby Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, which are just a couple hours’ drive north of the border of North Dakota.

When young doctor Juliet Dermer (Hilary Swank) moves into a spacious New York apartment, she can’t believe her luck. More so as she is attracted to her landlord, Max (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). However, something isn’t quite right with the apartment and Juliet soon comes to regret having ever moved in.
 
There has been a number of similar thrillers over the years, the type where a humble home is turned into a nightmare by the presence of some psychopath. The Resident, in spite of some lovely technical touches, sits comfortably on auto-pilot and hopes that is enough to seal the thriller deal. Sadly it isn’t!
 
Director Antii Jokinen and his co-writers Robert Orr and Erin Cressida Wilson have forgot to add twists and shocks to their picture. Things are further compounded by the fact that Morgan’s villain (it’s signposted a mile away) is about as scary as a puppy letting out its first bark.
 
Swank gives it a good go as the woman in peril, while Christopher Lee is a reassuring presence even if he is utterly set up as a token character. The sexual violation angle feels like a lame attempt to put some horror into a standard thriller set up, while the script is wooden and kills what chance of suspense there briefly was.
 
Some impressive cinematography and camera techniques keep it interesting to the eyes at least, but this is a waste of acting talent and a waste of time for those looking for something to chill the blood.

I was allowed to play any and all games, as long as they didn't involve demons or satanism.

""Morbius is yet another disaster from the Sony-Marvel shared universe.

Despite good performances from Jared Leto and Matt Smith and even a couple of visually captivating action sequences, the formulaic screenplay that seems to originate from the beginning of the century ruins everything in its path.

From the predictability and zero creativity of the main plot to the heavy reliance on uninteresting, unnecessary exposition, Daniel Espinosa finds his most significant problem in the blatant lack of care in the treatment of the characters.

The narrative logical lapses are too many to ignore and even amplified by extremely messy editing, a third act wrapped in an unfathomable blend of CGI, and a plagiarized score.

One of the most embarrassing productions by a major studio in recent years.""

526896,CinemaSerf,"I can't go lower than 3 stars because ever since ""Alexander"" (2004) I've had a tiny crush on Jared Leto, and some of the trails for this made him look swarthy and hot too. To be fair, also, he is not afraid of spending a great deal of time in the make up chair, as we saw in ""House of Gucci"" (2021) and frequently see here. Sadly, though, after my appreciation of Jared's eye candiness wore off, what I was left with was Luke Evans' ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) just without Charles Dance, and a hint of ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (from 1931). The imagery is fine, the film looks super - but so what. Marvel/Columbia should be doing that anyway. It's the story. It's so thin. Matt Smith is lightweight at the best of times, and together with Adria Arjona's really unremarkable contribution as Leto's sidekick ""Dr.Bancroft"" and some sparing interventions from the other Jared in this film (Harris) this all just lollops along as if it were just the money-no-object pilot episode of a drama series that will struggle to get a commission. I love the genre, but the words barrel, bottom and scraped came to mind pretty early on.

Morbius is a kind of a vampire Batman-Frankenstein mix. In the search of the cure for a rare and highly-debilitating blood decease, Morbius (a genius doctor) find a cure that has a terrible cost. His sickness is pretty much gone and he attains super powers, but also feel an insatiable lust for blood that can't be fully satiated by artificial blood. 

The movie revolves around Morbius trying to remedy the consequences of the evil he unleashed to the world. While the cinematography is pretty decent, the plot really sucks. In the end of the movie, there are too many open questions (and inconsistencies) in the plot. 

The movie seems to end very abruptly without any decent climax, and many of the secondary characters that I expected would play an important role in the resolution of the conflicts, seem to have been completely forgotten.

I had heard murmurs of <em>'Morbius'</em> being received poorly (as now I see via the average rating!) but didn't know to what degree, which is how I prefer it so I can form my own opinion - which is, I didn't dislike it. Admittedly I have nothing that I like either, but it's a forgettably fine film. In fact, I found it to be the quickest viewing experience of the year so far - the run time absolutely flew by for me.

The cast are a bit up-and-down. Jared Leto has a few moments and overall I'm OK with him in the lead role, meanwhile Matt Smith is more miss than hit but again didn't annoy me or anything like that. Elsewhere, it was pleasant to see Jared Harris and Tyrese Gibson in smaller roles.

The special effects, for the most part, are serviceable in my eyes. I think I also heard that people were questioning why the filmmakers didn't opt for prosthetics and went full blown CG for the faces - I found everything in that area to be fine, it would've been cooler if they mixed it up but if I hadn't heard anything about it I honestly would not have even noted it.

There are some lame lines of dialogue, namely that hunger one, and the credit scenes don't leave any excitement or intrigue behind. Aside from that, I genuinely didn't dislike this.

Who says he needs to kill or hurt people to get what he needs? Horrible premise for his actions, not believable at all. And the rest of the story is the same. Weird decision making, boring, pointless dialogue. The bad guy is suddenly bad lacking any morals because he was bullied once apparently. Vampire powers are a myriad of random things. One time he is able to fly and it is hard to determine why exactly, the movie suggests because a subway train is pushing the air in front of it. Not only is it nonsense, it also looks bad CGI wise.

I am totally -not- a Jared Leto fan from some of his other movies and was hesitant on that behalf to watch this film. But once in, he actually pulls off a very realistic doctor role that is also bitter on life due to his health.  Of course, looking for the solution leads to the bigger story that you could probably guess by now.  I'm also at a point where I'm ""over it"" with a lot of these superhero movies, so it was refreshing to see something different out of the MCU.  If I did have any complaints, there are some unanswered questions at the end, but you know, that always leaves room for a sequel.  However, on top of that, the two end credit scenes just add more ""Huuuh?"" and probably do more damage than good.

526896,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"I have to say that I quite liked this movie. A bit surprised since it is a new Marvel movie after all. It is even free of woke bull manure which made me even more surprised.

The “scientific” part of Morbius changing his DNA, overnight no less, by means of some serum that he derived from vampire bats is of course utter nonsense but one cannot really complain too much about that since it is straight from the original comic book character.

The story is really simple and not much to write home about but it works in its simplicity. After all, in this kind of movie we really do not need something fancy as long as it is not downright stupid. It only needs to be a vehicle for the action and special effects and for that purpose the story works fine.

I like Morbius. He is intelligent and he doesn’t just sink down in some self pity or whining sessions when he finds out that things did not go exactly as planned. Sure, he is not happy about it but at least he does research into his condition and he actually takes the effort to learn what he can do with his new powers.

I also do like the special effects and the action in general. The bad guy was rather predictable and not really very charismatic but he worked fairly okay. I think that most of the actors made a good enough job actually.

If I should complain about anything it was that scene in the beginning where they claimed that vampire bats could “finish off” big animals in minutes or something. That not what vampire bats do or how they feed. It is of course utter ignorant bull manure by some idiot script writer and it was really totally unnecessary to soil the movie with such nonsense already in the first scenes. I had hoped that ignorant script writers like that died out together with the last flying rubber Piranha in the early 80’s.

It is not a great movie. Not even a good movie really but it is a half decent B-movie horror flick. It sure as hell is better than that woke piece of trash that Netflix has produced with their TV-show adaptation of the franchise but then that does not really say very much.

The story is rather non-existent and things just happen for no good reason. It is like the writer just took a bunch of zombie and monster encounters and threw them in a mixer to see what came out. Sure there is a resemblance of a background story there but it is not much.

We never get to know why the zombies escaped into Raccoon City, why the experiments where abandoned or anything else that might enlighten us as to why zombies pop up here and there all the time (apart from the fact that it is a Resident Evil movie and it is Raccoon City of course). There also seems to be a number of characters in the movie that knows a lot about what is actually going on but again, we never really get much of an explanation. I have understood that the movie is based on the story in the first three of the games so I guess those that have played them might understand the why’s better.

The main reason to watch this movie is the special effects, the gore and the action and this is best done with your brain in the off position. There are indeed some decent gory special effects and I have to say that the monsters in the later half of the movie was pretty okay.

I do miss Milla Jovovich though. There is not really any good kick-ass replacement for her although some of the characters tried. Also, for f… sake, will the dumbass Hollywood script writers ever going to stop putting stupid shit in the movies, like firing off bazookas and rocket launcher in confined spaces, say a train car. It doesn’t work unless the goal is to also kill the person firing it you morons!

One thing that annoyed me throughout the entire movie though is the fact that it is really dark. Sure it is a horror movie so some dark scenes is to be expected but the entire movie is really really dark. To the extent that it really is difficult to see what is going on for a lot of the movie. It might have worked in a cinema but on a TV-screen, even with the pretty good OLED that I have, it is really too dark.

Character costumes looked like they were plucked right from the games. Sets and locations were identical to levels I spent hours playing. Easter eggs and nods throughout the film celebrated hardcore fans. Unfortunately, its flaws overshadow its victories. An overcrowded story with too many characters prevented developing the characters or making the story have any real impact. Forcing two full game stories into an hour and 47-minute run time had consequences. I enjoyed the movie’s attention to the slow descent from human to zombie, which showed the dread and hopelessness as the victims felt their humanity drain away. There is also a fantastic action scene in complete darkness where the muzzle flash provides the only light for the survivors to see.

Discussing what ""is"" Resident Evil will never be easy, both the games and the movies reached quite a wide audience, and the two cannons have widely different themes, lovers of the games will want more gore, darkness, horror and a bit of cheesiness, and lovers of the movies will be looking forward to big set pieces, pumped action scenes, and a wide cast of characters. Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccon City is clearly trying to bridge the gap by offering an experience closer to that of the games, but in movie form, and it gets close, the themes are there, the cheesy, but undeniably cool scenes are present, and the overall plot follows that of the games much more closely. Having said that, the movie lacked the courage to fully abandon the core formula of the previous movies completely, creating a weird clashing mishmash of ideas. Welcome to Raccoon city wanted to have a wide cast of important characters, and to do so it decided to borrow from 3 games at once, and in its attempt to convert 3 isolated storylines into one a lot was left on the cutting room floor, characters were poorly developed, many events were barely explained, and overall the movie lacked cohesion. It's painful to see how many good ideas were there that lacked the time to be properly executed, one glaring example is the character of Leon, one can see that the movie tried to give him a zero to hero arc, with him going from a clumsy cop to a strong-headed, laid back hero, but the audience doesn't have enough time with the character to fully grasp that growth, and it just ends up giving the feeling that his character just changes drastically from scene to scene.

400710,Frank Ochieng,"There is always a risk involved when revisiting cinema from the past and dusting it off in favor of an ambitious remake for the consideration of today’s adventurous movie-going audience. Hollywood has done this tactic for decades now so this is nothing new to contemplate as food for thought. It is one thing to try and bring back the freshness and impact of the original blueprint from yesteryear for a distinctive film that proved to be critically acclaimed, extremely popular, conveniently trendy and memorable for it box office heyday. So what gives for trying to resuscitate a mediocre 1990 Brat Pack medical psychological thriller and re-packaging it as an updated glossy horror/SF fantasy focusing on the tiresome and exploitative life-and-death theme for the millennial mindset?

Perhaps director Niels Arden Oplev (‘The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo’) can answer this puzzling inquiry as he presents front and center his modern-day take on the nearly three decade-year old Joel Schumacher-directed DOA drama **Flatliners**. Indeed, Schumacher’s original outing was not what one would call engaging or stimulating but at least it boasted a noteworthy listing of talented young Hollywood hotshots (Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland, Billy Baldwin, Kevin Bacon, Hope Davis, Oliver Platt, etc.) to give a creative jolt to this highly contrived existential experimentation regarding the afterlife. However, Oplev concocts a faceless rehash that offers tepid thrills and chills, frivolous fright impulses that amount to all the riveting tension of a leaky bed pan in the emergency ward and a paper-thin payoff that never quite delivers.

In portraying young idealistic doctors that have an affinity for exploring the unknown realm of the human condition beyond the physical alertness of existence is somewhat of an interesting concept in consciousness on various levels of medical science, spirituality and just plain man-made curiosity. Nevertheless, **Flatliners** (Oplev’s version, of course) does not have the inquisitive juice to lubricate any in-depth instinctive moral dilemma or philosophical ambivalence in this disjointed supernatural medical melodrama lacking a pulse (yes, pun intended). Oplev’s unimaginative direction and the run-of-the-mill script by screenwriter Ben Ripley does nothing to pump any bombastic blood in this cardiac caper that…er…has no intriguing heart (okay…another pun intended). Ironically, reviving the previous serving of the 27-year old Schumacher vehicle for a contemporary copycat that drips more than a faulty IV bag is the biggest fearful flatliner fantasy to behold.

Oscar-nominated Ellen Page (yesterday’s treasured darling courtesy of her spunky turn as a self-deprecating pregnant teen in 2007’s ‘Juno’) plays the film’s ringleader Courtney, a medical student whose guilt and fascination with death is incredulously shared by her group of contemporaries. Courtney is carrying a psychological burden involving a deceased sister, so naturally this is among the unfinished issues that haunt her personally. Basically, Courtney and her crew conduct risque experiments in the hospital’s underground basement in which they enthusiastically kill themselves only to be brought back to life afterwards. During their so-called flatliner sessions, they are disturbed by the ominous sensations of their life-and-death odyssey but remain captivated and invigorated at the same time. This does not deter Courney and her peers from stopping their hearts for the eerie adventurous rush they receive when entering the zone of a dream-like or appropriately nightmarish tranquility.

Among Courtney’s fellow medical heart-stopping thrill-seekers are James Norton’s Jamie, Nina Dobrev’s Marlo, Kiersey Clemon’s Sophia and Diego Luna’s Rudy, who is the recipient of the golden nugget for playing Page’s/Courtney’s lovey-dovey boyfriend whose primary role is to revive his sweetie and her associates after their treacherous trip through death’s delusional door. In any event, these halting heartthrobs (get the double meaning?) possess this awkward ambition to prove whether or not there is brain activity after leaving the land of the living. When the flatliners return to their lively senses, they acknowledge that the brain functioning has sharpened for the better. On the flip side, Courtney and her comatose cohorts all start to undergo some supernatural psychosis that promotes an array of problematic mental dysfunction. The significant vital signs include the drudging up of dark tormented secrets embedded in their damages psyches, monotonous memories that create disturbing unrest and an overall nervousness undefined in and out of their death-defying field trip into mercurial madness.

Interestingly, the mystery is not so much how dedicated and challenged these model-ready med students are ready to tip toe through the tulips of traumatic trances while bodily stopping their organs in the name of scientific ambivalence. The real mystery is why this insipid remake of **Flatliners** was even made and revisited in the first place? For starters, Opley’s nervous system narrative into the realm of human consciousness feels clumsy, trivial, pointless and frivolously far-fetched. Even Schumacher’s original edition, albeit it a shoddy one, had some semblance of attempted earnestness despite its cockeyed and uneven capricious construction. Here, Opley does nothing in the least to give his **Flatliners** any sense of flair, distinctive energy, dubious drive, lofty scares or hypnotic insight into this aimless, recycled material. The film looks cheaply produced and the real message of these young doctors’ journey into an abyss of deadened state is merely reduced to them hyperventilating at their own psychological indiscretions from the past. Sounds rather captivating, huh? The true malpractice at work here is the fraudulent posturing of **Flatliners** coming off as an intriguing mega-medical malaise of major proportions. Plus, the obligatory jump-scares are relentlessly obvious and overplayed. Simply put, this drowsy doctored drama has nothing to say or suggest other than to sprinkle some meaningless titillating CGI imagery around to give this horror-induced hokum some creepy credibility.

Although the winking gimmick of having original **Flatliners** star Keifer Sutherland return to his roots regarding the film’s reminiscence as a middle-aged lecturer is somewhat of a feel-good nostalgic touch, there is not much else that one can hang their hat on for this baseless paranormal puff piece into death-style delirium. Page’s Courtney and her care-giving counterparts come off more as polished twenty-something treats that should be shooting a provocative TV ad for The Gap clothing store rather than portraying death-jumping doctors. Sophomoric dialogue and the soulless randomness into the landscape of living and dying take its silly-minded toll beyond belief. Page, once an adventurous and resourceful actress with a nuanced nose for notable colorful parts in indie and mainstream films, is embarrassingly handcuffed to this SF/horror health care hazard of a motion picture.

What **Flatliners** needs or any other regrettable notions of its future sequels or remakes is a decorative quarantine sign hanging on its hospital bed.

That idea was abandoned in favour of a straight up film-remake, but still I was interested if for no other reason than the cast. The end result? This one's even worse than the original.

Strictly on a personal level, I always felt that the original Flatliners was average at best. A missed opportunity to use the premise for frightening results, to unnerve, unhinge, whilst intelligently examining the life after death question. So when news of this 2017 remake broke I wasn't in the least bit surprised, the idea at the narrative core was ripe for further filmic delvings.

 Niels Arden Oplev's 2017 version is itself problematic, and a long way from being all the things I so wanted from the original film, but at least it has its own twists, a supernatural slant for scares. The makers are also to be applauded for making a truly bold decision in the story, rendering complaints about this not offering anything new as being redundant. 
Chances are that if you are a fan of the original film you will hate this, if like me you have no affinity to it then this is an ok time waster. While for those not familiar with the 1990 pic can go in for some mild shock and afterlife dalliances. 6/10",2018-07-22T14:04:32.498Z,6.0,Flatliners,2017

400710,Alunauwie,"Though often mistaken as a remake, Flatliners (2017) functions more as a spiritual sequel to the 1990 version, retaining only the core idea of near-death experiments. The film offers a fresh cast and plot but suffers from shallow character development and a rushed narrative. Despite strong performances—especially from Elliot Page—the execution lacks the depth and coherence of its predecessor. Misleading marketing and weak story connections to the original likely fueled unfair comparisons. Taken on its own, it’s watchable, but far from exceptional.

1735,John Chard,"Not the same Mummy twice, nor thrice for that matter.

Well it's been pretty much universally panned has this third Brendan Fraser led instalment of the new age Mummy series. So lets not beat around the bush here, it's not very good, but it's hardly deserving of the 1/10 ratings it has been given by amateur on line reviewers.

The plot (for what it's worth) sees young Alex O'Connell, now amazingly a grown man in a short space of time, unearth evil old Chinese Emperor Han and his accursed Terracotta Army. Naturally some bonehead is going to bring him back from the dead, and naturally the now retired O'Connell's are forced back into their Mummy fighting ways. Can Rick, Evelyn and poor Jonathan save the day? Will Alex prove his credentials as the offspring of such daring-do parents? Will anybody care come the finale? 

Rachael Weisz has (wisely) bailed and into her shoes comes a woeful Maria Bello, with fluctuating accents and zero chemistry with her leading man, Bello has undone the promise shown in World Trade Center & A History Of Violence. Steer clear of action movies dear. Fraser looks bored and can barely muster the energy to deliver the now tired and stilted lines. He admitted once that The Mummy 2 was basically a cheeky remake of the first film, quite what he has to say about this one I await with much interest. John Hannah is merely a bystander and it's probably the easiest money he will ever earn, an utter waste it be. Luke Ford does OK as Alex and Michelle Yeoh, Jet Li (the Emperor) & the beautiful Isabella Leong make do with what the unimaginative script gives them to do.

What saves the film from being a bottom of the barrel feeder is the action quota. Even though the spectre of poor CGI hangs around every corner, the sequences come thick and fast and they at least keep the blood pumping, thus stopping the audience themselves from drifting into a centuries long sleep. There's some good gags too (you will yearn for more of Liam Cunningham), while the choreography for the fights involving the Asian stars is not to be sniffed at. Stephen Sommers left the directors chair for this one, handing over to Rob Cohen, which explains why the film is more concerned with action accelerate over substance. But Sommers, who gave us a genuine genre delight with the first film, has a writing credit and was on production duties for this effort. I trust he now feels saddened by what his franchise has now become. 4/10",2019-04-03T01:32:35.364Z,4.0,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,2008
1735,Wuchak,"***High adventure in China, albeit totally overdone***

In 1946 Rick & Evy (Brendan Fraser & Maria Bello) are bored in their middle age in England and so take an assignment to China where they meet Evelyn's brother (John Hannah) and their son (Luke Ford) who has discovered the tomb of a tyrannical ancient emperor (Jet Li). Unfortunately, there’s a secret plot to resurrect the mummified remains of the Emperor and all hell naturally breaks loose. Michelle Yeoh and Isabella Leong are also on hand.

""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" (2008) is an overblown action/adventure horror/comedy popcorn blockbuster, just like the first two flicks. It's not as good as “The Mummy” (1999), yet it's better than the unabsorbing “The Mummy Returns” (2001). Yes, it's overdone like the second one, but the story is more compelling.

While it's regrettable that Rachel Weisz opted out of this third film in order to be with her one year-old son, Maria Bello is a solid replacement and actually looks better in tight pants (as she's curvier and therefore more physically appealing).

Of course the film’s preposterous in the tradition of the previous two and the Indiana Jones flicks. But let's give credit where credit is due: “Tomb of the Dragon Emperor” bends over backwards to entertain with tombs, priceless artifacts, mummies, Shanghai, the Great Wall, the Himalayas, yetis, Shangri-La, zombies, a three-headed dragon and martial arts.  

If you can get past the absence of Weisz and embrace Bello (which, let’s face it, isn’t that hard to do), this is easily the second best of the trilogy. Interestingly, Roger Ebert maintained that it was the best and he ain't no slouch when it comes to appraising pictures, whatever the genre. Yet my wife zeroed-in on the film’s flaw, which is the same as the previous flick: It tries too hard. It frantically throws in everything but the kitchen sink and is the lesser for it. (Yetis, seriously?)

The movie runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot in Buckinghamshire, England; Montréal, Québec; and China (Beijing, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia, Tianmo, Heng Dian, Dongguan & Terracotta Warriors Museum, Xi'an, Shaanxi).

1735,r96sk,"<em>'The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor'</em> is the weakest of the trilogy, even if it does have arguably the best title of the three. I do think there is enough positive about it that it is worth watching, though admittedly the plot does feel threadbare - it's nowt enthralling either.

I do appreciate the refresh of sorts we get, however. It doesn't feel connected much to the prior installments, which I guess would be a negative for some (many?) but to me the lore change from Egyptian to Chinese (plus cities/mountains) made it slightly more interesting than a proper rehash would've.

The special effects are just about passable, probably better than the original two films - I should hope so too, given the time difference in release. With that said, I wasn't a big fan of the Yetis, they didn't quite work for me visually and also in terms of how they work with the plot.

Brendan Fraser returns, which is good. Jet Li (albeit as a lame character; not helped by the boring effects used for the Dragon Emperor) and Michelle Yeoh are welcomed additions, Yeoh is the standout in my opinion. Luke Ford is solid enough as Alex.

Maria Bello replaces Rachel Weisz, unfortunately. That's not a rejection of Bello, at all. More so that I dislike recasts and Weisz was perfect for the role, so any replacement was always going to fall short. Bello is an actress I do enjoy though and she herself is fine throughout.

I could very easily be rating this a notch lower, to be honest. For some reason, the rating I've chosen feels more befitting. It produces good and less than good things, the former just narrowly outdoes the latter.",2025-02-19T01:54:13.191Z,7.0,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,2008

What I didn't like was the story, as it confused the hell out of me. I couldn't understand the motivations of the main character, or really any other character in the movie as they really gave no reasons for anything they did nor could those motivations be inferred, and the lack of dialogue meant no one asked why about anything. Or if anyone questioned anything, the best answer you get is thats just the way it is. I could accept that if what it was made any sense, and most of the time it didn't. I'm going with a bold idea that was mishandled.

The overall concept was good, but I did not like the initiation. I don't like any film of cannibalism. I don't know why such films are made. What's the point! Definitely not entertainment or art. It could only encourage such savage culture. So I thought I made a mistake picking it to watch. Except the opening, the rest of the film was different. Then ended as a just below average product.

In a near future, where all the criminals, illegal immigrants are dumped in a waste desert land. So they have made their own system, divided by two. One the savages and the other is kind of civilised, but not without flaws. A new arrival who experience from both the end, had to decide where she belongs when a series of bad events had taken place.

Here comes another film from a woman director. Her previous film was one of the worst in the history of filmdom. And again this is not her best work either. Though I liked the cast. They all performed well, particularly Jim Carrey. Yes, I did not recognise him at first. Then there's Keanu Reeves. But Waterhouse was good. I wish her a good future. Generally not recommended, but then it's your choice!

The setup is engaging enough, and the production is solid for a Blumhouse film, but there's nothing groundbreaking here. The tension is there, but the scares rely too much on predictable moments and overused horror tropes. It moves fast enough to keep things from getting boring, but at the same time, it doesn’t leave much of a lasting impact.

The acting isn't bad, and the cast does what they can with the material, but the film as a whole feels forgettable once it's over. It has a few moments that work, but the story doesn't do enough to stand out from similar supernatural horror films. If you're just looking for a casual, easy-to-watch horror flick with some creepy visuals and a decent pace, it might be worth a shot.

It’s not as bad as The Nun, let me write this straight away. If there’s one thing that this movie proves is Michael Chavestalented filmmaking skills, which offers hope for The Conjuring 3. Contrary to the other spin-off of the universe, The Curse of La Llorona toned down on the lazy exposition and elevated its scary sequences, simply by having a more capable director. Beautiful one-take scenes are spread throughout the runtime, which not only increase the suspense but prove that Chaves actually works hard to provide a terrifying environment.

He also delivers some effective and innovative jump scares, even though most of them still follow an annoyingly predictable timing. These are still heavy on the cliche of “character turning her head, big ugly monster face screams and the score goes from silence to screeching volume.” Scenes like these aren’t scary anymore and they feel dated, as well as the typical origin story. There’s nothing new or exciting in an “urban legend turned true.” Fortunately, the backstory is simple, it isn’t filled with explicit exposition every two minutes, and the short runtime helps the film to develop through a fast pacing. Sadly, it’s just another common horror screenplay that the writers took from the scripts cabinet.

Linda Cardellini gives a strong performance as the protagonist. Even though every character in this movie makes questionable decisions that lead to avoidable events (something inevitable in horror films), Anna is a compelling and courageous woman, who only wants to do what’s best for any children, not only their own. Raymond Cruz portrays Rafael, a priest who sort of almost is a deus ex machina. He barely has any kind of decent character development, but he works well enough as comic relief to lighten up an otherwise too dark tone. The kids are good, but Patricia Velasquez (Patricia Alvarez) is way over-the-top, which doesn’t help her already not-so-good script.

All in all, The Curse of La Llorona is … okay. It’s not near as horrible as The Nun, and honestly, that’s a good compliment for such a typical and cliche horror flick. Michael Chaves truly saves what could have been a disaster with another director. Wonderfully handled one-take sequences, which elevate the suspense levels, and he also produced some imaginative jump scares, even if most of them still lack actual scariness. Linda Cardellini is great as the lead, but every character is compelled to make dumb decisions to move the plot forward. Some characters needed more care in their scripts, and more focus on the story to tell instead of just creating scares after scares.

Close, but not close enough …

Not to quote Gloria Stuart, but it feels like forever since I've enjoyed a movie from this franchise - and this isn't even an 'official' part of <em>'The Conjuring'</em> universe (which probably explains why it's actually good - harsh, yet true). That's not to say it's amazingly made, e.g. there is some iffy writing; that part near the end with the doll is rather dumb, if ignorable.

Linda Cardellini brings a very good performance, while Raymond Cruz is a neat piece of casting. Roman Christou and Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen make for solid kid actors, too. Tony Amendola appears as Father Perez, but remember it's absolutely <b>not</b> a part of <i>the</i> franchise...

The Mystery Inc team take on several monsters from their past adventures brought to life by an evil masked figure. 

As with the first film, Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini shine as Shaggy and Velma. Freddy Prinze Jr. is good as Fred while Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne doesn't quite fit the role, although she's likable and serviceable. I'm sure she got the part because of her popularity at the time. Seth Green and Peter Boyle have significant peripheral roles, as does Alicia Silverstone, who's a highlight but unfortunately underused. 

Whereas the first movie was shot on the east coast of Australia this sequel changes the locale to the Vancouver area of British Columbia. Of course, it's location is Coolsville in the story, wherever that's supposed to be. In any case, the extreme switch in locale changes the dynamics a bit. 

There's also more emphasis on action and paying homage to the cartoon. Plus it emphasizes that Velma is sexier than Daphne, at least with Cardellini as Velma and Gellar as Daphne. There are some worthwhile morals as well, like simply being yourself and not trying to be someone else.

Unfortunately, it's too goofy and busy for its own good. Sure, it's based on a cartoon from 1969-70, but that show somehow kept things closer to reality and interesting whereas this movie goes over-the-top to the point of overkill. Instead of one monster to track down, there are eight-to-ten. It's too much and I found my mind wandering. Less is more.

This is definitely a Adam Sandler/Happy Madison Halloween story, through and through.  Lots of dirt humor throughout, and way too many pee jokes.

377,CinemaSerf,"This is the ultimate in slasher-horror that thrives on the basis that it is, at times, genuinely quite scary, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Robert Englund is super as the legendary ""Freddie Krueger"" who, complete with his razor sharp right hand, takes over the dreams of the teenage children of parents who had been responsible for his gruesome death many years earlier. When a terrorised ""Nancy"" (Heather Langenkamp) begins to put two and two together she sets out with cute boyfriend ""Glen"" (a first outing for Johnny Depp ) to trap him in her world - and that means drinking enough coffee to sink the Titanic and staying awake! Ronee Blakely does a mean impersonation of Faye Dunaway - as the girl's almost permanently drunk mother (whose battles seem to get larger as the film progresses) too. It doesn't hang about - Wes Craven keeps the pace almost frantic, and there is plenty of humour to keep it's tongue in it's cheek. The effects are limited, but fun, and the whole thing raises more smiles than goosebumps but it's still an entertaining watch 35 year later.",2023-06-08T10:06:57.514Z,7.0,A Nightmare on Elm Street,2010
442249,Gimly,"_The Purge_ has come a long way since its inception. Originally used as nothing more than an excuse to explain away ""Why don't they just call the cops?"" in your average home-invasion movie, the original _Purge_ movie had implied classism for the meat of it, and then an actual call to class division right at the end. Since then, the classism, and racism in American society has become a focal B-story to the _Purge_ movies, and now we're in 2018 for the prequel - _The First Purge_ - and those issues are now the whole point of the movie. Some might say that it's because the movies have lost any sense of subtlety, personally I think it's more that the creatives are sick of people missing the point.

_The First Purge_ can't have been an easy thing to give the go-ahead in the current political climate over in the US, but it's important, and moreover, not a bad little film, socio-economic politics aside.

The killers were basically doing what they did in the first one, so that stays true to the source material, and then we get this amazing 80s soundtrack throughout the movie. Heck, we can almost enjoy Bonnie Tyler's 'Total Eclipse Of The Heart' in its entire length, while at the same time sitting there with the eyes glued to the screen, because you don't want to miss a single detail.

Jason Voorhees is unintentionally revived from his watery grave by a girl with telekinetic powers.

And so the Friday the 13th bandwagon rolled on for another sequel, a part 7, that once again pitches the unlikable Voorhees against a number of annoying teen types. Those involved here deserve some respect for at least trying to add some impetus to the flagging series, here by way of a gimmick, that of a telekinetic foe played by Lar Park-Lincoln, but ultimately it just ends up same old same old. In fact it's a considerable step down from the more fun and funky part 6. 

The telekinetic issue becomes something of a side-bar, which is annoying as there's a potentially great thread involving a devious doctor (Terry Kiser) that never reaches the heights it should have. There's a little thought in the writing as regards grief management, but ultimately all hope of something more substantial gives way to Voorhees slicing and dicing kids we don't care about anyway. We could watch the first 3 films if we wanted that again.

10281,Wuchak,"***""Carrie"" vs. Jason with a subpar script***

Released in 1988, ""Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood"" takes place about ten years after the previous film, which explains its title ""The New Blood"": Tommy Jarvis is no longer in the picture and there's a new set of youthful blood for Jason to spill. This installment is the second to feature Jason as an inhuman rotting corpse and the F/X of Jason at the end are great. The highlight of Part VII is the inclusion of a Carrie-like heroine with mental powers who squares off against Jason at the end. We also get Terry Kiser as Tina's therapist, Dr. Crews. If you're not familiar with Mr. Kiser, he played the charismatic preacher in 1968's ""Rachel, Rachel"" in the mind-blowing Pentecostal service sequence.

Although my title blurb describes this segment as ""Carrie vs. Jason,"" it's the same Friday the 13th formula, but with a protagonist who has Carrie-like abilities. The script is weak however and needed tweaked to work out the kinks, which makes it the weakest in the series next to Part III (and the last act of Part IX).

This entry features a quality collection of females, which the franchise is renowned for, but the creators failed to milk them for their potential, so to speak (and I don’t mean nudity or sleaze since the movie has a little bit of both). For instance Jane (Staci Greason) and Robin (Elizabeth Kaitan) are the top women, but not enough is done with them. Jane’s role is too brief as she’s the first to buy the farm while Robin eventually has some quality screen time, but the director fails to truly capture her beauty. For those who care, the attractive Sandra (Heidi Kozak) has a brief skinny dipping scene. Meanwhile Melissa (Susan Jennifer Sullivan) is decent, but she’s depicted as such a biyatch you almost WANT her to die.	

As far as locations go, Part VII was shot in Southern Alabama, just northeast of Mobile, with bits done in Southern Cal (e.g. the house where Robin is killed is in Topanga).

BOTTOM LINE: Part VII is another retread of the same Friday formula with the distinction of the protagonist having psycho-kinetic powers and, like the previous film, Jason is now totally inhuman, an infernal monster. In addition, the climax is the best yet, featuring the ""Carrie"" vs. Jason fight and a spectacular explosion. Unfortunately Part VII fumbles the ball a little in regards to its subpar depiction of the women. Worst of all, the script is amateurish like Part III. Nevertheless, it's a fairly entertaining installment that thankfully lacks the camp of III, V and VI.

NOTE ABOUT THE ENDING (***SPOILER***): No, the corpse of Tina's Dad was not left in the lake for ten years, the original ending made it clearer that her Dad's body coming out of the lake was a product of Tina's mind powers, although the long chain was real. Of course, this doesn't explain why Jason's corpse was still in the lake early in the film, but I suppose we could chalk that up to the curse that was on Crystal Lake and the fact that no one in their right mind would want to visit that part of the lake (near ""Camp Blood"") by this point in the series.

The film runs 88 minutes.

10281,Nathan,"_Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood_ continues where its predecessor left off. It has an iconic tone that balances campiness while tacking itself and the antagonist seriously. The added element of telekinesis, thanks to the badass Tina, which really sets this one apart. I really enjoyed seeing a final girl that also has supernatural powers that are able to truly take on Jason one on one. But other that Tina, there were not a lot of characters that were really memorable, most of them were the run of the mill teenagers that were simply there to add to Jason's kill count. The kills in this movie were pretty mild as well, although the sleeping bag kill is iconic and is probably the coolest kill in series history. I was really going to give this movie 3.5 stars, but the ending was so weird and corny that I had to lower it to a 3. Even though this movie takes a lot from part VI, the loss of Tom McLoughlin is definitely felt with the slight decrease in quality.

10885,John Chard,"A heavy burden.

American remakes of Asian horror films have mostly struggled to win grace and favour with horror fans. Shutter is no exception, it has been met with the usual howls of derision, claims of it being pointless, loosing the horror essence of the original and etc. But what for someone like me who hasn’t seen the original?

I found Shutter to be much like how I found The Ring, the Naomi Watts starrer from 2002, a very effective chiller with a solid mystery to be unravelled at the core. The ghost is creepy – as are the various photographic links, the scares handled professionally by the makers, and the finale pays off with a startlingly chilling revelation that freaked me out; and I’m a middle aged man!

It’s far from perfect, the pace is a bit haphazard, logic goes out the window often, and cast performances are only adequate in the absence of  “A” list stars to propel the story onwards. While it’s tough to hang your hat on the two principal players since the emotional empathy hasn’t been earned by them, courtesy of the writing. Yet with no frame of reference to raise expectation levels – or down them as well, this is a safe and sturdy spooker that does its job well enough. 7/10",2014-10-05T01:18:04.263Z,7.0,Shutter I,2008
10885,The Movie Diorama,"Shutter takes Polaroid remnants of the original without the stunning flash. This is a peculiar remake. During the towering heights of Hollywood westernising world-renowned Asian horrors, mostly from Japan and South Korea, Japanese director Ochiai opted to alter the story of Thailand’s arguably most famous eponymous horror with American actors, set in Japan. Western audiences apparently wouldn’t be spooked if the ghost haunting the main characters wasn’t a pasty white Japanese girl with luscious black hair and masses amount of eye liner. It’s a cluster of cultures, and whilst the end result isn’t exactly terrible, it’s far from being tolerably good. Because much like ‘The Grudge’, ‘One Missed Call’ and ‘Pulse’, the underlying sense of pointlessness becomes an overburden for everyone involved.

A photographer and his new bride travel to Tokyo where they accidentally smash into a girl standing in the middle of the darkened misty road (bare foot, might I add!). And so, through the ominous power of spirit photography, they become haunted. Specks of mysterious white vapours and the glistening sunlight against the camera lenses, being interpreted as ghostly entities attempting to communicate with the living. “The dead latch onto the flesh”.

Without changing the essence of the overall story too much, just minor details here and there, Ochiai manages to produce various suspenseful moments through the usage of anonymity. The ethereal cries of a haunting girl, the innocent humming of an eerie song and the most intense tonguing since Toad got struck by lightning back in ‘00. The supernatural elements work best when nothing is showed on screen. The dark room sequence when Megumi entered the room, although initially presumed to be Jane, was executed with enough slow-paced tension to become effective. Dropping a splinter of wood into a solution that causes a tsunami into the eyes? Ineffective. Electrocuting one’s self in a desperate attempt to rid the latched ghost? Well, I don’t need to tell you how stupid that is.

Dawson’s script is less than impressive. Masses amount of exposition and one-dimensional development that forced characters to be nothing more than tourists and amateur photographers. Seriously, Jane is the worst tourist. Shouting in the faces of locals exclaiming “excuse me, where do I go!?”. Is she oblivious to native languages? Like, she failed to even attempt one word in Japanese. That’s not Taylor’s fault, who isn’t the most talented actress in existence, but managed to bring out some surprising emotionality towards the film’s conclusion. Jackson on the other hand? Ehhh. He’s the kind of guy you want to slap for acquiring no personality. Just bland. His character’s best friends are pointless and sadly resorted to expendable deaths that suffered from no build-up.

The central mystery that powers the narrative does captivate, even if Ochiai’s direction made certain twists obvious due to extensive foreshadowing, and that’s the primary element for preventing this remake from venturing into the realms that we do not speak of. I’m looking at you ‘One Missed Call’ and ‘Pulse’!

So yes, Shutter is fine. As a film, it functions by itself with enough flash for the uninitiated. However, for those who have watched the original, you’re bound to find disfigurement within the composition of this photographic remake.",2020-01-16T14:01:15.754Z,4.0,Shutter I,2008

Actually, this film was made before 'Lucy', but released after that. So I first saw that and now this. Basically, these two films are similar thematic, except the genres are different. I liked Scarlett's film, a very much enjoyable. This film too looked nice, and watching it after that makes to understand it better. I meant scientifically, rather than a supernatural way. So what's extra in this was the usual horror film style jumpy scenes, with loud and sudden sounds.

Limited cast, and one day event based film. Not a bad writing or the direction and performances. The settings were perfect, and the film did not require strong graphics. The story followed a small medical researcher team who is working on a serum that brings the dead back to life. When their entire work was ceased by the company they were working for, they decide to recreate everything to prove its theirs. Then something goes wrong, following a series of destruction before it all ends.

Like I said, it was more a science-fictional thriller than your regular horror film. But it borrowed the same style to present on the screen. The events are simple to understand, except that scientific thing. Because there won't be any difference for those who are weak in basic science. It'll be another normal boring horror flick. For me, it's an average film, watchable for once being short and well paced narration.

Only she doesn’t come back the same. She returns sinister, malevolent, and murderous. That concept with a production company like Blumhouse and a cast boasting Olivia Wilde, Donald Glover, and Evan Peters made me think this had to be a solid horror flick. Unfortunately, it didn’t live up to my hopes. The writers of Lazarus Effect couldn’t decide the rules for their own movie. Is evil Zoe battling with the darkness trying to take over, or just evil? Is she superpowered? Is she demonic? Is she preying on the others or just twisted? The script never seemed to figure out what they wanted the character to be. With Zoe being the central focus and character, the failure to solidify and develop her character sunk the rest of the film. Still not the worst. I liked the open ending with the terror multiplying for a potential sequel, but with a mediocre response to this film, a sequel will never happen.

104755,LastCaress1972,"The Lords of Salem is the latest film by industrial rocker-turned-auteur Rob Zombie, and I think it's a good'un, although it's already polarizing people.

Sheri Moon Zombie (Rob's wife who features heavily in all of his movies, though this is her first star turn) is Heidi, a recovering addict and local rock DJ in Salem, Massachusetts, site of the infamous witch trials of 1692. She receives a vinyl record in a wooden box from a band apparently called The Lords, who later on also inform the station that they are performing a one-off gig in the town. Upon playing the record at home however, Heidi experiences migraines and hallucinations of a 17th century coven, performing some manner of birthing ritual, apparently attempting to bring Satan himself to mortal life. Her male DJ colleagues simply experience the tune as a weird, rather turgid dirge (although it'll stick with you like a demonic earworm) and play it over the air on their rock show, where it acts as a sort of trance-inducing spell on many of the women listening. From there on in, Heidi's mental state begins to deteriorate and the migraines/hallucinations increase, not helped by her return to drugs or by her peculiar landlady and her two friends, all of whom seem creepily interested in Heidi and what her ""fate"" might be. Her ""fate"" as it turns out is attending this Lords gig, except that in many ways, it's really HER gig. And what's happening with that supposedly vacant room at the end of the hall? I'll go no further, partly because to do so would be to give too much away, but mostly because to try to explain it would be futile. You need to see it.

The Lords of Salem is, for much of its runtime, Rob Zombie's most restrained feature film. It can move pretty slowly most of the way through, although thanks to Mrs. Zombie's best on-screen work to date and some great supporting performances throughout, particularly from Dee Wallace, Judy Geeson and Bruce Davison, those slow moments are largely spent getting to know and like our protagonists (or of course, become ever more unnerved by our antagonists). However, it's the sections where The Lords of Salem lets rip - including a finale that takes an absolute swan-dive off of the cliffs of tangible reality into the seas of utter lunacy - that are dividing opinion. Rather than a balls-to-the-floor gore flick, what we have here is a retro-heavy European art-horror piece, akin to any of Dario Argento's more hallucinatory efforts. The imagery is incredibly striking and bold, and very much as you'd expect from Mr. Zombie, if you're aware of his previous work (House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects - neither of which I thought were particularly good, although I may revisit Rejects at some point soon - the 2007 remake of Halloween and its 2009 sequel - both of which I really enjoyed), but because of that retro restraint that same imagery also rides a very fine line between bold and laughable depending I guess on whether you're able to buy into those arthouse horror stylings or you're not, and find yourself pulled out of the movie. The low budget (I've seen figures between $1.5m and $2.5m punted about) isn't an issue until some of the more ambitious special effects present themselves, but if you're not ""feeling it"" at that point, you're not going to. Personally, I like a film that has some scenes that aren't necessarily explained away by a perfunctory, realistic narrative, I like a film - especially a horror - to adopt a retro vibe from time to time, as long as they're done well (which this is), and I love a bit of witchcraftery and devilishness. The Lords of Salem reminded me in many of ways of Ti West's excellent slow-burn retro creeper The House of the Devil, but with added... well, with added Rob Zombieness, I suppose!

104755,Wuchak,"Witchcraft/Satanism in modern Salem by Rob Zombie

RELEASED IN 2012 and written/directed by Rob Zombie, ""The Lords of Salem"" is a witchcraft/horror flick starring Sheri Moon Zombie as a DJ in Salem, Massachusetts, who is sent a wooden box containing a mysterious record dubbed ""gift from the Lords.” The creepy music thereof triggers flashbacks of her town's infamous past. Is Heidi going crazy or are the witches taking revenge on Salem?

The ambiance, mood, directing, music, locations, sets and cast are all top notch, showing that Zombie has developed into a quality director since his first shot eleven years earlier with “House of 1000 Corpses,” which was shot in 2000. This is serious haunting horror as opposed to the campy black comedy of “1000 Corpses” (not that there’s anything wrong with that, lol). The movie mixes elements from ""The City of the Dead,” aka ""Horror Hotel"" (1960), “Suspiria” (1977), “Rosemary’s Baby” (1968), “The Wicker Man” (1973) and “To the Devil a Daughter” (1976). If you like any of these movies, “The Lords of Salem” is as good or better.

Usually when you see old hag witches in movies it’s kinda eye-rolling; not so here. Rob gives us the real deal and it’s not pretty, although I admit to busting out laughing every time the witches hailed Satan. Speaking of which, modern Wiccans won’t like how the films mixes Witchcraft with Satanism (the truth hurts). Interestingly, there’s almost as much Christian imagery as there is Satanic.

One thing’s for sure, Zombie doesn’t paint witchcraft/Satanism in a positive light. It’s similar to “The Witch” (2015) in this respect, where converting to witch-dom meant becoming a baby-slaughtering, blood-bathing, family-destroying, goat-sucking, friggin’ pedophile hag with the illusion of youth. When the Devil eventually appears in “Lords,” it’s anything but a positive image.

The story seems to perpetuate the myth that those condemned at the Salem Witch Trials in 1692-1693 were burned to death. Actually, 19 people were hung, another slowly crushed to death, and over 150 imprisoned.

Sheri makes for a strong protagonist, but she’s the extant of any eye candy on the female front. As noted earlier, the witches are all hideous hags and look even uglier with their clothes off. Meg Foster surprisingly appears as the lead witch. Meanwhile, Judy Geeson, Patricia Quinn and Dee Wallace are on hand as a dubious trio in modern Salem. Speaking of whom, they have a great (hilarious) tea scene with Bruce Davison, who plays an expert on witchcraft.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 41 minutes and was shot in Salem, Massachusetts; Sable Ranch, Santa Clarita, California (witches dancing around fire); and the Los Angeles Theatre (opera house).

This is a spin-off of the 2014 film 'Unfriended'. So there's no comparison between them But you can't stop people doing that, particularly saying which version they liked the most. For me, I enjoyed the other one which was a bit different than usual in the same themed films. This one was not a single day event based film. It was stretched and developed, especially for the film characters to give more depth in the storytelling. A brief flashback in the beginning, and then comes back to the present with twist and turns in the tale.

Largely based on facebook culture of the youngsters and the filmmakers applied the same old horror film formula to the rest. For some viewers it will work, particularly facebook fans, I guess. But this was an average film. Everything was already seen before in different film and you are only seeing it which is associated with social media, that's all.

A German film, but made in English language and cast. The actors were decent, but in some case I was not impressed. There were many flaws, but surely they all can be explained where the film did not do that exactly as it should have even stretched further. That's the point, for being too casual, so the film looked like one of those B category horror-thriller from the past. For watching it once, okay. That includes if you have seen the 2014 film or not, because it is completely different and not fresh enough to impress us.

The story is good, and the way they go about investigating the mystery is good in the traditional sense: a good cycle of drip fed information, search and discovery.

The premise of the haunting itself isn't that interesting, but it is somewhat compelling that it has a ""Beauty and the Beast"" vibe to it, and Terence Stamp does ""creepy old guy"" very well.

It's to this creepy mansion that estate agent ""Evers"" (Eddie Murphy) is summoned and eyeing a decent commission, he takes his wife ""Sara"" (Marsha Thomason) for a dinner that soon exposes them both to some spooky goings-on. It seems that ""Mrs Gracey"" met with a rather untimely death and ""Mrs Evers"" seems to be lined up to take her place - like it or not! Stamp gets what plaudits this deserves largely for seemingly having a bright light shone in his eyes for most his scenes. Otherwise, it's a pretty lacklustre vehicle for a very mediocre star who has long since lost his lustre, supported by some folks who largely bring very little extra to a party that suffers from quite a paucity of, well, haunting... To add a bit of weight to the storyline, the writers have included a sort of familial neglect angle to the characterisation with ""Evers"" too focused on a successful career and not so attentive on his wife and two rather annoying children. It does all come to an head eventually, with a bit of help from the ethereal ""Madame Leota"" (Jennifer Tilly) and whilst it's entirely forgettable on just about every front, the visuals are quite fun and ""Ramsley"" is possibly the best butler since Tim Curry.

19912,Leigh Bowden,"I had low expectations when I entered the theater to see the 5th installment of the FD series, because the 4th movie was such a disappointment. But after watching it, I was surprised. First off,this movie was way,( and I mean), way better then the last two movies were. It was darker and had a lot of elements from the first movie, which I loved. I don't want to give away too much, but I do want to say that the last scene of the movie will leave you speechless. It had me thinking, ""OMG, that was AMAZING how they came up with that twist."" One last thing I loved about this movie was that it was well planned out and thought of, unlike the forth movie which was a joke and in my opinion, shouldn't have never been made. The deaths weren't rushed as opposed to the deaths in the forth movie, and it gave more screen time to introduce us to the characters. Note: I will say that there is one death scene in the movie that I didn't see coming, besides the ending. I recommend you see this movie.

19912,John Chard,"It's not actually final...

You can just imagine the suits sitting around their big round table discussing how to churn out another financially beneficial Final Destination movie and get away with it. Big suit number one puts forward that they obviously need more inventive mouse trap like deaths. Big suit number two has the genius notion that 3D is again taking off so why not utilise that option too. And that's pretty much all that it took, with the end result being a movie that is very self aware of its roots, but still plays out as the runt of the Final Destination litter.

Just as the director of the first one, James Wong, was brought back to direct part 3, the makers here bring back the director of part 2, David R. Ellis, to direct part 4! Which ultimately proves to be nothing more than some sort of nepotism like factor because The Final Destination is basically just over 82 minutes of poor acting, bad writing and a series of kills weaved together by the odd 5 minutes of barely relevant characterisations (the exposition as painful as the gory deaths!). 

The kills entertain as they pretty much always have throughout the franchise, with the opening disaster sequences (here set at a speedway stadium) continuing one of the series' great traditions. While the opening and closing X-Ray/Skeletal credit sequences are superb and a credit to those involved. Yet it all feels so tired, where in spite of the willingness to upgrade the technology, it's still lazy and has nothing to really justify its very being other than that to make easy money. 

The makers of part 5 would have to come up with something special to not turn this franchise from being one that was once bright and inventive, into that of a money train joke. 4/10",2015-08-02T05:40:42.960Z,4.0,The Final Destination,2009

A positive surprise. Most people have said that the second third and fourth film slipped compared to the first one and it wasn’t until the fifth film that the series took off again. Well they’re wrong in my opinion.

This installment was a lot better than the third one. Sure if you do not like gory horror movies then you wont like this film but then why did you even bother with it? Me, I like these kind of films so I was quite happy to see it.

19912,Wuchak,"***More of the same, but with one of the better ‘final girls’ and superior music***  

The first ""Final Destination"" movie in 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, an invisible spirit. A group of people, mostly teens, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying the kids who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually an unlikely chain of events. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash, in the second it's a highway pile-up, in the third it's a rollercoaster mishap while in this fourth entry it’s a tragedy at a racetrack. The fifth film (2011) features a bridge collapse.

All of the movies in the five-film franchise tell the same basic story with different characters and minor nuances; all of them are of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on your preference for cast members and the death sequences (and the locations). Other than these factors they're all basically the same.

Released in 2009, ""The Final Destination"" (aka “Final Destination 4”) has a quality redhead heroine in Shantel VanSanten. The director wisely showcases her beauty in a tasteful scene, which none of the previous movies managed to accomplish. Haley Webb and Krista Allen are also on hand in the feminine department. The previous film arguably has the best assortment of women in the series.

While it’s true that you know exactly how this film plays out if you've seen the first three installments, or any of them, there are some highlights beyond the females.  For one, this movie has the best music yet, whether score or soundtrack. The opening tragedy is thrilling as usual and there are several creative death or near-death scenes involving a tow truck, a pool, a car wash, a cinema and an escalator.

The film runs 93 minutes and is the only installment that wasn’t filmed in the Vancouver area. The entire movie was shot in the East as follows: The speedway sequences were filmed in Mobile, Alabama; the closing mall scenes in McKinley, Pennsylvania; other scenes & studio work in New Orleans/Harahan, Louisiana; and reshoots in Orlando, Florida.

The plot is as basic as it gets, just an excuse to showcase over-the-top death sequences. The directing feels uninspired, and while the cinematography makes the most out of the 3D gimmick, it doesn’t do much beyond that. The acting is forgettable, with characters that feel like placeholders rather than actual people. The script is weak, filled with stiff dialogue and little attempt at making you care about anything beyond the next death scene. The sound design is decent, especially during the kills, but the score is generic and does nothing to elevate the tension. If you’re in it purely for the ridiculous deaths and don’t expect anything more, it’s watchable, but definitely the weakest in the series",2025-03-13T01:12:23.074Z,3.0,The Final Destination,2009

For the first time in this series, I'm disappointed with some of the effects - those computer-generated bits for the premonitions have aged badly. The proper gory stuff remains suitably good, if less effective. Aside from the cast and effects, the premise stays largely unchanged and it's dull as.

26688,Wuchak,"***Wannabe edgy slasher “remake” with distasteful characters and shaky cam***

During a sorority party in the Pittsburgh area a student accidently dies. Those involved in the prank-gone-wrong make a pact to cover it up, but during graduation eight months later members of the agreement start showing up dead and it becomes clear that the killer knows their macabre secret.   

“Sorority Row” (2009) has the same plot as “The House on Sorority Row” (1982), but the story & characters are totally different. I heard good things about this slasher, but was disappointed. Don’t expect the worthwhile ‘remakes’ of “My Bloody Valentine” (2009), “Black Christmas” (2006), “The Fog” (2005), “Fright Night” (2011), “House of Wax” (2005) or “Friday the 13th” (2009). 

What’s wrong with “Sorority Row”? There’s too much faddish shaky cam, which gets annoying; and the outdoor colors are faded, which is also annoying. The cast of females is decent, with Rumer Willis (Ellie), Briana Evigan (Cassidy) and Caroline D'Amore (Maggie) standing out (Audrina Patridge’s role is too small to note), but the wannabe edgy tone makes it hard to warm up to any of them. It doesn’t help that the directors don’t know how to photograph women. 

In addition, the ending “reveal” is unconvincing and unsatisfying. There are other eye-rolling problems, like why Maggie would stand in front of car and risk death for no ostensible reason.   

The movie runs 1 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in the Pittsburgh area as follows: Homestead, Crafton (interiors), Washington (aerial views) and Soldiers and Sailors Museum and Memorial (graduation scenes).

It would appear that their finely hones military skills are no match of the their hungry opponents as they are gradually whittled down - even their own guns are turned against them as someone manages to somehow crawl out of a portable toilet! The dialogue is banal and the director Martin Weisz has managed to assemble quite possibly the least capable cast of acting talent I have seen since ""Mesa of Lost Women"" (1953). The photography is good; we do get up close and personal with the frequently quite brutal action, but it appears that another side effect of surviving a mushroom cloud is a seeming invincibility when shot in the head at 5 paces - which after a while becomes really quite dull to watch.

9042,furious_iz,"Predictable B movie creature feature that doesn't get past budget restraints, a weak script and a lack of adequate direction.

A bunch of divers and scientists try to map an undiscovered underwater cave in Romania, for reasons I have now forgotten, and get more than they bargained for when they encounter a new species of creatures dwelling within. 

The premise is well worn, but that doesn't mean it has nothing to offer to the genre.  In theory at least.  The film plods along with characters announcing what they see in front of them, almost like they are performing an audio play.  Most of the film is all tell and no show, which is a mistake for the medium it is delivered in.

The B grade cast take what they are doing very seriously, and most of them are trying to do the best with the material they have.  Sadly the script is weak, there is almost zero character development and people are constantly behaving irrationally.  I know it's an action/horror, and no one ever acts normally in those films, but to have experienced salvage divers panicking so quickly when things go south is stupid and unrealistic.

Some of the design for the creatures are interesting and kinda cool, with surprisingly adequate CG for a B movie, and they are what elevates it from complete garbage to just not very good.  Unfortunately most of the action scenes are edited at such a frenetic pace that you almost have no idea what is happening.

Could have been worse, but probably should have been better than it was, maybe would have been better with a more seasoned director.  The biggest fault lies with the weak script though, so maybe it was always destined to be what it is.

A different animal to the Halloween films that preceded and followed it, Season of the Witch is slowly but surely gaining an appreciation as a standalone horror film. Gone is Michael Myers’ indestructible killing machine, in his place is the nefarious Conal Cochran (Dan O’Herlihy), the owner of the Silver Shamrock corporation that specialises in Halloween masks. Cochran has a sinister plan this year - and it’s deadly - Dr. Daniel Challis (Tom Atkins) and Ellie Grimbridge (Stacey Nelkin) are caught in the middle of the vile plot and may just be the only salvation to Americana.

With Nigel Kneale involved in the writing process Season of the Witch is delightfully fiendish. There’s definite barbs being stung here about the commercialisation of holiday occasions, Cochran is intent on restoring Halloween to the true meaning of its origins, creating a Silver Shamrock world order in the process. Kneale would take his name off the credits when the studio tampered with his vision, a shame because his core essence remains -  even if Cochran as a Warlock Wicker Man type could well have been genius.

With John Carpenter and Debrah Hill over seeing things from their production chairs, the picture had supervision of some standing. Tommy Lee Wallace maybe directing but it feels like a Carpenter movie, from Dean Cundey’s photography -  Carpenter’s foreboding synth musical score – and the sharpness of the horror scenes (which are excellent), it’s not hard to see the “non Michael Myers” Halloween series  that Carpenter had envisaged after part 2 had been and gone. 

Boosted by an irritatingly potent advertisement jingle (a Silver Shamrock variation on London Bridge is Falling Down) that counts down the days to Halloween and the day of carnage, Season of the Witch is consistently gnawing away at the senses. Having Atkins and O’Herlihy propping up the acting helps, both are reliable performers for this material, while the race against time finale has edge of the seat credentials.

It doesn’t all work of course, there’s some drag and the narrative feels schizophrenic at times, while if it wasn’t for Cundey’s camera work then Wallace’s inept direction of scenes would be over exposed. Yet as it asks Halloween franchise fans some forgiveness for not actually being part of the franchise, it delivers a smart sci-fi horror hybrid that’s not without shock and awe. 7/10",2014-11-03T01:15:11.575Z,7.0,Halloween III: Season of the Witch,1982
10676,talisencrw,"I distinctly remember being in Grade 8 when the film came out, and for four major reasons: 1) The excellent TV commercial, with John Carpenter's spooky music and the spider crawling out of the mouth of the mask; 2) The decent book adaptation written for young adults, that I read at the time, and thoroughly enjoyed; 3) Karen Carpenter died of a heart attack from anorexia nervosa; and 4) Major songs on the radio around that time were 'Centerfold' by The J. Geils Band and 'Bette Davis Eyes' by Kim Carnes. Though I had not yet seen the previous two films and wasn't old enough (the R-rating, and my parents were somewhat strict about that kind of thing), I really wanted to see it, but over the years, I never really got around to it, until recently I found used the entire 'Halloween' franchise on a 10-blu ray pack, and no longer have any sort of excuse, really.

I loved Wallace's work in 'Stephen King's It' (except for the last half-hour, but that's probably the book's fault and not the director's) and I thought his 'Vampires: Los Muertos' was rather underrated, so an added attraction for me was to watch his directorial debut here. He impressed me. I enjoyed the film and all of the extras on its blu ray very much. If you like horror films at all, you should watch this. 

Protagonists Tom Atkins and Stacey Nelkin are very good here, and I liked Dan O'Herlihy even better than when I had previously seen him in 'The Virgin Queen', 'Imitation of Life', 'The Cabinet of Caligari', 'Good Against Evil' and the first two 'RoboCop' films, and, as always, Dean Cundey provides excellent cinematographical work and the soundtrack by Carpenter and Alan Hogarth is dependably solid. Don't bother with the negative reviews that came out at the time the film was released: Most people were upset that the film didn't have Michael Myers in it, and didn't give it a chance.

Except the audience, after two stellar slasher films wanted Mike, so best laid plans of mice and men and all that.

10676,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**The biggest problem with this film, full of problems, is the title.**

After seeing this film, I felt the need to read things about it to understand why it is so strange and different from the previous two. The conclusion I reached is the simplest: if there had been another title and no relation to the “Halloween” franchise, I would have had better luck. If we forget the title and put aside our initial expectations, if we try to evaluate it for what it is, it doesn't seem so bad, although it is far from being a film that I would like to see twice.

If you tell me that it is absolutely horrible because it has no relation to its two predecessors, I would have to agree. After two successful films, it was predictable that the public would create expectations, this also happened to me. However, there had to be a logical reason for the film to differ from the others, and the reason is simple: John Carpenter, who at the time owned the rights to the franchise, did not want to make a franchise around the same villain, but a series of totally different movies around Halloween. When being coerced into reusing the villain and continuing the story in “Halloween 2”, he killed him at the end so that he could not be reused, this film being a return to the filmmaker's original plan. What Carpenter failed to understand was what the public wanted, and the dismal failure of this film was solely a result of that lack of understanding.

Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, who wrote the script together with Carpenter, it has the master's inspiration throughout. The story he tells us is quite creative, it is something original, but it is not a good story. The predictability of the plot is a problem right from the start, so that we already know the film long before we reach the end. The quality of the dialogues seems to vary a little, it is not constant, and the added sci-fi elements seem to be there too much, perhaps more due to the enormous popularity that this genre of fiction acquired at the time than for any real benefit to the plot and the final work. Another problem is the poor conception of the characters, without any ability to empathize with the public, without any relationship with each other and with several stupid situations: for example, the bizarre and cold way in which a character behaves after the strange death of her father, going to the point of getting involved with a woman he doesn't know that well. And this becomes even stranger if we consider the terrible performances of an amateur cast, in which only Dan O’Herlihy manages to stand out in the slightest.

Technically, the film has some points in its favor, starting with high quality cinematography and sets, good filming and good props. The sound effects can be a little too intrusive in some scenes, but in compensation we have a good set of special and visual effects, especially the androids and the entire final part, where they are used more abundantly.

616820,Nathan,"_Halloween Ends_ is such a weird film, as a standalone movie I enjoyed it but in the trilogies totality it underwhelms and undermines. With each entry in this trilogy, the movies get farther and farther away from what Halloween is. With Ends there is no tension and no horror, there are some good kills but with nothing building up to it they felt stale. This movie also tears down Michael Meyers in a way that felt out of place in the trilogy. Halloween Kills built Michael up to be an indestructible force with the ability to withstand fire or multiple gunshot wounds, but in Ends that is flipped on its head making him weak due to the ending of the predecessor. It left me feeling like the writers had no idea what they were doing in developing this trilogy. The marketing of the movie was a total farce as well. It was building up to a final clash between Laurie and Michael, and while that does happen the majority follows a character that was just introduced (Corey Cunningham). Even though I really like the opening sequence and backstory to Corey, it had no place being centerstage in the final installment. Overall, this movie was slightly better than the sequel but still squanders the potential that Halloween (2018) had for the trilogy. If any more movies or trilogies are made in the future, please for the love of God hire a producer/writer to develop the entire series instead of piecing it together film by film.

Halloween Ends, is an inarticulate mess, that fails to build on past films. Instead, it delivers an incomprehensible story, that makes little to no sense, save that it brings the overriding story, to a somewhat confused, conclusion. 

On the upside solid acting and some tense, jump scare moments but really, its not enough.

This film is a straaaaaaange beast and it probably holds the world record for the quickest development of a relationship on screen. Bloody hell, I wanted that relationship to succeed.

I'm going to be controversial here... did we need Michael Myers at all here? Maybe the 2 or so scenes we get in the sewer early into the film and that's it... maybe pass the evil on and Michael die of his wounds.

The evil is contagious element worked for me and Corey (played by Rohan Campbell) was the standout character.

Issues? Yes, there are some - the narration and memoir aspect weren't needed and Corey's mum... erm, I'll leave it there.

Entertaining at times and frustrating at others, _Halloween Ends_ is a bloody scenic route of a conclusion that is mostly satisfying despite its underappreciated albeit risky detours.

Otherwise, this is just one ""Halloween"" movie too many and it's only scream yells ""put me out of my misery"" pretty much from the start of this slow and plodding denouement to the franchise. Rohan Campbell (""Corey"") is bullied by some kids who end up shoving him from a bridge. He is dragged into the storm drains by you know who and emerges a man possessed. He has also attached himself to ""Allyson"" (Andi Matichak) who just happens to be the daughter of long suffering ""Laurie"" (Jamie Lee Curtis) and after a bit of hysteric family melodrama, all of her demons are flee-flowing and we are heading, slowly and ponderously to a conclusion that the best of which has already been seen many times in the trailers. This is far too long, virtually nothing happens until the last fifteen minutes and even then, there isn't even the vaguest hint of menace or jeopardy. The production is adequate, but JLC doesn't really feature often enough - as in ""Halloween Kills"" (2021) to make much impact - and the whole thing is episodic and smacks of made for television.

<em>'Halloween Ends'</em> gave me more than I was expecting, if I'm honest. After the solid if slightly underwhelming <em>'Halloween Kills'</em> I thought this may fall further adrift but, happily, it doesn't. I think that I like this the most of all twelve entries after the original, which is probably still a jot above this one in my mind.

I won't repeat myself too much as I've summed up my overall thoughts on this franchise in prior reviews of those other flicks, but in short I enjoyed this release more consistently throughout and the characters actually interested me a fair amount.

Jamie Lee Curtis is, obviously, the star of the show, but Rohan Campbell is a great addition and Andi Matichak gives her best showing of these David Gordon Green films. In previous installments the cast behind (or sometimes in place of) Curtis have failed to truly entertain me, perhaps aside from the first one and (minimally) <em>'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later'</em>, but here I was happy to follow the scenes involving those behind Curtis.

I will say that the third act lost me a little in terms of interest, though that's only ever so slightly as all in all I had a good time with this. Let's hope they end this franchise here but I highly doubt that they will - gotta catch that £!",2023-11-01T01:54:21.827Z,7.0,Halloween Ends,2022

As you can imagine, not all of those scripts need to be filmed. At the same, Roseanne Liang rises to the challenge of her one-location war movie, making a hunk of airborne junk feel downright claustrophobic and staging episodes of bonkers action with an admirable lack of restraint. 'Shadow in the Cloud' is an absolute mess, but it's also a small miracle that it's as entertaining as it is.

I consider Chloë Grace Moretz (Greta) one of the best actresses of her generation. I would be pretty surprised if she doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination in the next ten years. While it's true that her choices don't always end up being good movies, she's rarely the one to blame when things don't work out. In Roseanne Liang's film, she's undoubtedly the glue that holds everything together. Moretz perfectly handles what it's close to being a solo movie - she's literally stuck inside a tiny turret - demonstrating extraordinary emotional range.

For most of the runtime, the viewers are placed inside a claustrophobic place, watching the protagonist communicate through radio with the other crew members, who so happen to be extremely sexist, annoying male characters. While I do understand the intent behind this character archetype, it becomes so on the nose that it almost makes the director and her co-writer, Max Landis, the ones who seemingly never met any other type of army men. The narrative holds so many distinct ideas that go from a monster flick to a war drama, and their balance is all over the place, just like the score (Mahuia Bridgman-Cooper).

Once the mystery surrounding her package is revealed, and the action sequences start taking the front stage, the story takes a huge leap into the utterly absurd. From one of the most shockingly hilarious uses of an airplane explosion to the unbelievability of everything that happens in the third act, it isn't easy to shut down my brain when the film until that point was going more for the grounded depiction of how it is to be an isolated woman in the Air Force than a straight-up sci-fi/monster/action flick.

Despite all that, I can't deny its entertainment value and the exceptional lead performance.

Sometimes it is a really great thing to go into a movie with extremely low expectations, and I certainly went into this thinking it's going to be boring.  That's its a WW2 courier movie, but it really is so much more.

It honestly feels like this is a collection of stories that are all stitched together in a fantastic way.  It's modular storytelling, and while it's a trend I've been noticing in the beginning of the 2020's this goes above and beyond.  It's almost a 5-act movie, but each act is it's own 3-chapter act.  They nailed the writing in this so that it is both powerful and captivating.

It's not just a WW2 story (though that's the setting), it's not just a woman's story, it's not just a hero vs evil story, it's not just a captive / isolation story, it's not just a combat story: it's really all of these and more with some great cinematography to enhance it all the way though.

This is definitely worth the watch, and don't let any aspect of ""I heard it was an x movie"" stop you.

<em>'Shadow in the Cloud'</em> is bonkers, I had a blast watching it. There were no rejected ideas in the writers room, that’s for certain! I'm glad to see that this hasn't been slaughtered via reviews; at least not to the level I was expecting. It’s utter madness and I’m fully here for it, the amount of craziness they fit into less than 80 or so minutes is nuts; the special effects - aside from the iffy end fight, granted - is neat for a production of this standing.

Chloë Grace Moretz legit gives a great performance, easily her best that I’ve currently seen. The rest of the cast fit their roles well, with the radio comms made great use of for large portions for the cast behind Moretz. I thought it’d get boring being so talky at the beginning, but it never did.

Immense rewatchability to this, I’ll no doubt be revisiting it. It makes absolutely zero sense, like whatsoever, but it might be the best 'switch off your brain' flick out there. No joke.

As they travel, some of the rather asinine crew become suspicious of her, her package and when they begin to see things; when things start to go a bit awry with the plane - then the crew must brace themselves for quite a surprise! Sadly, though - the execution of this isn't up to much. The acting is poor, the special effects straight from an episode of ""Stargate"" and the score tries very hard to compensate for the lack of menace generated by either cast or director. The story allows itself to get caught up in the relationship issues of the crew, never a great thing with an adventure film and the ending is just plain daft.

Sometimes, people ask me if I feel less motivated to write about a movie I didn’t like or even simply hated. Not even close. Matter of fact, it might be the exact opposite. The only films which I find hard to write a review on are those who don’t have a single aspect that is either outstanding or horrible. Those who are so “in the middle” that you forget about them less than 24h after you’ve seen it. 47 Meters Down: Uncaged could very well be this type of flick, but its ludicrous logical issues story-wise are impossible to ignore. Even the title is just a marketing scheme to attract people who liked the 2017’s original since it is entirely unrelated to it (the water depth at which the characters are is never addressed).

This is one of the worst movies of the year. It still doesn’t beat Serenity, but it made me rethink about the latter’s grade because I find it so incredibly difficult to acknowledge one single good thing about this terrible sequel. Had I scored Matthew McConaughey’s film an F, this one would probably belong there as well. However, in the same way that a film without flaws isn’t necessarily an A+, a movie with no redeeming quality isn’t instantly an F. If there’s one compliment I can give Uncaged is that there are two or three short sequences where a jump scare is effective, or the suspenseful vibe was accomplished … Nevertheless, these are still just a couple of minutes in an almost 90-min runtime.

The characters have no development whatsoever. The story follows the most pathetic path possible. The sharks (which are the reason people actually went to the theater) are not as visually realistic as in the original, reaching a point where the CGI was pretty awful. A fish screams … I mean, really?! Who the hell supervised this mess? Characters talk underwater seamlessly with no explanation on how they are effectively talking. I could sit here and write dozens of questions that defy the film’s logic, but I’ll stop here. Not because I don’t want to (if this wasn’t a spoiler-free review, I’d go crazy), but due to the fact that the main issue with the movie isn’t the atrociously illogical plot points, but the lack of entertainment.

Fast and Furious, Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers … All of these are (financially) successful franchises. Audiences all over the world fill theaters and enjoy these series for what they are: popcorn entertainment. No one goes for the complex plots or layered characters. People go for the action, the explosions, the epic scores, the visual effects, and all of that stuff. Uncaged doesn’t have any of that to compensate its other problems. One or two scenes here and there aren’t enough to warrant the price of admission. Even the acting is mediocre. 

All in all, 47 Meters Down: Uncaged is nothing more than a silly attempt at the start of a new franchise. Don’t be fooled by its title since it has nothing to do with the original flick. It doesn’t try to introduce compelling characters, the shark sequences fall flat for the most part, and the screenplay is filled with laughable plot points. There’s no sense of logic. For an 89-minute runtime, it astounds me how it can’t be slightly entertaining, to say the least. Undoubtedly, one of the worst films of the year. Skip it, so they don’t have enough money to try and do a third one. Who knows?! Maybe they’ll bet on original, smaller flicks from genuinely talented filmmakers who want to work hard and deliver a good movie.

Theo James seems almost lifeless as “Will” in this post-apocalyptic adventure – did he ever establish a character before getting on camera? It doesn’t feel like it. James lumbers through scenes, lacks depth, and is just never believable as a man on a mission to save his pregnant fiancé from impending doom.

Forest Whitaker is Forest Whitaker as the goateed “Tom” who sets on a journey with Will, his soon-to-be son-in-law, to find his daughter Samantha. Whitaker rescues several of the scenes from being completely devoid of expression, but there is only so much you can do when the dialogue is itself so banal.

How It Ends plays like a short film that was extended to feature length. There were scenes that simply could have been cut, or at least shortened to keep the pace quicker. With the right editing, the one-hour, fifty three-minute film would have been more effective at ninety minutes. But maybe Netflix steers for lengthier content — the longer the program the longer viewers are streaming from the service — and that must be good for stockholders.

351211,Frank Ochieng,"When _The Blair Witch Project_ burst upon the cinematic scene in 1999 it was an unspeakable breath of fresh air because it deviated away from the conventional creepers that marched to the same old boo-enhanced beat. Sure, _The Blair Witch Project_ certainly was not blessed with the most creative screenplay nor could anybody definitively state that the acting was convincing to the point of no return. Nevertheless, the genuine shocks were ideally realized due to the execution of this little indie terror tale that managed to sell a morbid mystique that translated into a gory goldmine at the box office. Hence, _The Blair Witch Project_ became an unlikely sensation trending around its distinctive flair for what has become the ubiquitous and overused found footage genre nowadays.

Indeed, _The Blair Witch Project_ sparked a creepy curiosity and gave birth to a unique movement in horror flicks where it managed to formulate a whole refreshing perspective to digesting frightfests based on the art of eerie suggestion through the power of promotion. Of course the “promotion” in this case presented a group of periled young people (the typical expendable guinea pigs in this kind of cinema) armed with cameras as they explored the Maryland-based woods that would end up creating a speculative frenzy about what remained through the lens of shaky images as these sitting ducks ran for dear life. Thus, the atmospheric vibes and presumed doom of these wandering targets in the woods captured a whole welcoming imagination to the manner in which little imaginative horror gems could rival the big-budgeted spook spectacles coming out of the Hollywood machine.

Naturally, _The Blair Witch Project_ (as most horror-based original blueprints) was enthusiastic to capitalize on its big screen impact but not without the amount of success it originally generated the first time around. Some may recall the tepid sequel in 2000’s _Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2_ that left a dull mark for those that were stimulated by the amazing first installment. Now it would take a 16-year gap to wipe off the nostalgic dust of a boorish _Blair_ outing for another entry in the pale and anemic imitation **Blair Witch**. Unfortunately, director Adam Wingard (“You’re Next”, “The Guest”) has no absolute vision or hearty energy to channel **Blair Witch** into a scary showcase worthy of its own garish identity. Wingard and screenwriter Simon Barrett merely conjure up a shadowy copycat of _The Blair Witch Project’s_ goose-bumpy reputation as **Blair Witch** is rendered a listless retread. Look, there is nothing wrong with attempting to recycle the spirit of an unassuming ground-breaking horror fable that gave considerable forethought to how movie-going fans viewed scary movies in general. Still, there is a time and place for gloom-and-doom experimentation in the heart of the wicked-minded woods that worked its magic prior to the millennium age of movie-making. However, 17-plus years later there is no excuse for **Blair Witch** to be lame and lazy in its artificial scares given its continuation to carry on _The Blair Witch Project’s_ haunting bloodline.

**Blair Witch’s** premise centers on the special bond of a brother-sister duo…or shall we say brother-missing sister duo. James (James Allen McCune) wants to look into the 20-year disappearance of his sister Heather who vanished in the Black Hills Forest. James is almost certain that Heather is alive and well. Furthermore, he contends that perhaps Heather is an instrumental part of the Blair Witch legend that exists. So James sets out to investigate his sister’s whereabouts but not without his entourage joining him.

Among James’s friends that journey into the deep woods are Lisa (Callie Hernandez), boyfriend-girlfriend team Peter and Ashley (Brandon Scott and Corbin Reid) not to mention a couple of tour guides in Lane and Talia (Wes Robinson and Valorie Curry). In particular, Lisa has another reason to go trekking through the fearsome forest with James and company–she needs to bring along her camera and record her adventures for a film school project. And so James and his crew foolishly set out to chase the notion of survivalist Heather as Lisa concentrates on her agenda to helm a documentary-style thesis for her film-making studies. Soon, the telegraphed chaos ensues for which **Blair Witch** fanatics are accustomed to by now. The serving of the repetitive shaky cam, the so-called spontaneous hysterics and nerve-racking aura of the surrounding woods comes off as a hammy, inconsequential effect. The chills and thrills are relentlessly watered-down. Plus, **Blair Witch** does not effectively utilize its low-budgeted charm to convey the mounting tension…at least to the degree that made the original edition more appealing in its small scare toxicity.

Routinely, **Blair Witch** is manufactured with all the creativity and originality of a haunted house’s creaky door searching to be lubricated. There is nary any genuine shocks or jolts that register with an impacting punch. The recipe for **Blair Witch** is a shameless by-the-dots regurgitation of the aforementioned 1999 trail-blazing woodsy terrain-terror treat. The film gets off to a rather clumsy start spotlighting lapses of silly-minded fodder to compliment the toothless scares. Sadly, the gradual build-up is relentlessly standard and morphs into typical cheesy slasher fare with an obligatory methodical pick-off of the scattering youthful prey. The only positive take that **Blair Witch** wears with a badge of honor is its advantageous usage of technological upgrading (both demonstrated on screen based on the characters’ sophisticated equipment in the storyline and the behind the scenes shoot). In being a louder and flashier production does not automatically constitute **Blair Witch** as a well-received found footage horror show. In fact, Wingard’s twitchy narrative fails despite the applied modern-day filming flourishes. In hindsight, transparent scares just does not cut it anymore in the realm of the horror universe.

Structurally redundant as it travels down the familiar wooden path, Wingard does have high regard for the reminiscences of _The Blair Witch Project’s_ legacy but it is too bad that he could not emphasize his cinematic appreciation more soundly in this woefully flaccid, forest-bound frightener.

Anyway, I haven't seen the other sequel, you do not have to be familiar with that to follow this one. So I saw it, but what I thought is, basically this film is exactly same as the first film. Just the characters and timeline changed, that's all.

They had nothing much of choice, so the story was repeated with the modern equipments. A new set of people, including a brother of one of those went missing two decades ago, heads to the same woods to investigate. But soon they all begin to witness strange, horrifying events. Now it becomes their survival game of getting out safe from there, but would they? Is what the film's end to notify us.

If you are a horror genre fan, particularly about the killing stuffs, then you might enjoy it. Other than that it was not scary, well, it was not for me. The today's generation might enjoy it better, but if you are like above 30 and already saw the original, this will be an average or trash. So young people should watch it. For me, it was okay, because I was not expecting anything from it. So I hope they end it here, no to another sequel or the reboot.

Virus is directed by John Bruno and written by Chuck Pfarrer and  Dennis Feldman. It stars Jamie Lee Curtis, William Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, Joanna Pacula, Marshall Bell, Sherman Augustus, Cliff Curtis and Julio Oscar Mechoso. Music is by Joel McNeely and cinematography by David Eggby.

The crew of an American tugboat boards an abandoned Russian research vessel and quickly sets about claiming salvage rights. However, there is something on board, just not human, and it potentially spells doom for all.

Virus is a derivative big-budget genre film that is not only a hack job, but almost certainly the lowest point of Donald Sutherland's otherwise superb career. The premise here has been mined many a time before, including the previous year to ""Virus"" with ""Deep Rising"". However, unlike ""Deep Rising's"" glorious sense of fun amongst the creature feature carnage, ""Virus"" is unintentionally funny since it's all played very straight.

The humans are up against alien robot thingies, one of which looks suspiciously like a robotic ""Brundlefly"" mixed with ""Short Circuit's Number 5"". There's a modicum of interest in the virus narrative thread, with the need for human body parts a tantalising proposition, but it looks and comes off as feeble steals from better genre pictures. The high energy finale, with whizz bangs and fire crackers, is at least played with good action intent, but by then it's too late to save a rip-off stinker that wastes a very good cast list. 3/10",2019-10-17T20:45:26.609Z,3.0,Virus,1999

By the time A Nightmare on Elm Street had rolled around to this, part five, Freddy Krueger had long stopped being a scary bogeyman.

Cue friends of the pregnant Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox) being stalked and offed by the old stinky green and red jumper killer.

It's all very frenetic and cartoonish, with gore replacing scares. There's a little ingenuity with some of the kills, such as a comic book section that has a good thought process, but once the laughable finale arrives - cuz - like - love conquers all - then you may be digging out parts 1 & 3 to remind yourself how good this series used to be. 5/10",2015-10-12T07:07:23.028Z,5.0,A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child,1989

After a young publicist and her teen brother (Christina Ricci and Jesse Eisenberg) encounter some kind of beast in Hollywood Hills, they sense strange things going on with their condition.

Helmed by Wes Craven, this comes in the tradition of the two “An American Werewolf…” movies and “The Howling” series, it just had a way bigger budget compared to the sequels in the latter franchise. It was shot in March-June, 2003, with only 6 more days to shoot the climax, but top executives at Dimension Films were not happy with the final confrontation, as written, or how the F/X were progressing. So, production was shut down and recommenced the following November-February with only an estimated 12% of what was previously shot remaining. Several cast members and their footage were completely removed, including Heather Langenkamp, Illeana Douglas, Corey Feldman, Robert Forster, James Brolin, Scott Foley and Omar Epps.

This leaves us with a kinetic film that works pretty well for most of the first two acts before morphing into a mess in the third. The flashes of a werewolf are effective until one is shown in detail close-up at the 73-minute mark, which looks like cartoonish CGI from the 90s. Then there’s an eyerolling ‘gay’ character thrown-in out of nowhere (in a sequence ripped off from Buffy the Vampire Slayer), which would’ve been considered ‘avant-garde’ at the time.

Eisenberg works well as the geek and his transformation is a little reminiscent of the protagonist in “Christine” from two decades earlier. On the female front, Ricci never looked better in her cute, petite way. Mya is also worth a mention, not to mention blonde Portia de Rossi in a bit part.

At the end of the day, this is a case of producers fudging up what would’ve no doubt been a quality werewolf movie. It’s still dynamic and entertaining to a point and worth checking out if you like key cast members. Unfortunately, the last act is ridiculously overdone and just doesn’t mesh.

It runs 1 hour, 37 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles, as well as places nearby, like Torrance High School and Verdugo Hills High School.

Nevertheless, even if it aspires to be nothing more than a simple horror flick, it falls short in providing consistently thrilling moments to warrant a fifth instalment in the franchise. Fans of the “Paranormal Activity” series will be the target audience for this film, and if you fall into that category, you’ll enjoy it because not only does it follow the same exact formula as the previous films in the franchise but also expands on the world they’ve already established and includes a satisfying twist at the end.

1975,The Movie Diorama,"The Grudge 2 resents its illogical plot for basic ineffective jump scares. Shimizu’s western remake of his J-horror creation was one littered with promise, albeit irrefutably rough around the edges. Mediocre acting, snooze-inducing storytelling and jump scares aplenty. Japanese ghost children, that either croak as if exhuming a sore throat or scream like a domestic cat, popping their heads out of attics, entangling women in wavering hair and just being a general nuisance. Well, Shimizu begrudgingly brings Kayako and Toshio back for more ghoulish antics, as the fire initiated by Sarah “Buffy or Daphne, your pick...” Michelle Gellar somehow unleashed the dark spirits into the world. Essentially no longer restricted to the abandoned Saeki household, although still only haunt those that enter the house? I don’t know, the logic is tossed out of the shōji at this point.

Instead of remaking the original sequel for ‘Ju-On’, Shimizu and writer Susco opted for a more original take, answering the fundamental question that we all yearned to ask: “gurl, where did you get that eye liner?”. Turns out, dark spirits is the answer. What I supremely detest about this sequel is the direction the two aforementioned crew members decide to take the story. It’s no longer about greeting death with a deep and powerful rage, cursing the location the spirits resides in. A semi-folklorish strand of Japanese traditions.

Instead, to appease the simple minds of western mainstream audiences, they settled for a mundane supernatural progression that essentially tarnishes the original’s plot in almost every possible angle available. Sure, Shimizu integrates some well-intentioned imagery that may or may not produce a chill or two. Namely the photograph sequence and bludgeoning someone with a frying pan during breakfast (what a waste of bacon!). Yet these are often accompanied by a predictable jump scare that relinquishes the horror. Kayako pouncing out of a photograph. Kayako wandering the hospital corridors bursting lightbulbs in her wake (not very cost-effective...). Kayako playing footsies in a Love hotel room. Kayako being Kayako. Once or twice was enough. Twenty times? Rapidly becoming unimaginative.

The non-linear intersecting sub-plots, imitating its predecessor, provided no twists to the narrative and, if anything, forced the pacing to be inconsistent with its constant switching between character perspectives. A classic peer pressure scenario which is enough to make anyone’s eyes roll a hundred times.

Magic mirror tricks, very unfashionable hoodies and an absolute waste of Buffy.

This film came five years ago, but I watched it now. A US-Russian collaboration product that's entirely takes place in Moscow. This is an alien invasion theme, but slightly different than those similar films. It never gives the reason, just the destructions like apocalypse on its way. That means it is about the survival. A group of Americans who are in the Moscow for different reasons joins the hands after people started to turn into ashes with the contact of the strange electric mist that came from the sky. So what's their plan now and whether they get out of it safely or not focused on the remaining film.

Surely some people would enjoy it. It's not all bad if you are not expecting a masterpiece. I should have seen it in digital 3D for a better experience, even the normal watch is not that bad. The turns in the story were unpredictable, particularly the film characters, but the twist wasn't. They kept the open ending, and you know why is that. I liked the performances, not individually, but the overall everyone, including the Russians.

The film was also shorter, which means fast moving tale. The graphics were okay, especially those electric mist thing, but disappointed for not show the aliens other than for fractions of seconds during the fightbacks. Despite enjoyed watching it, I'm not in favour of it, because it's just one of those films that falls in the average category where the majority of those who watched it not happy for not detailing everything in the film.

71469,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**Good CGI, good action scenes, good sound, Moscow is an interesting place, but everything else is so weak and stupid that it's not worth watching this movie twice.**

I decided to watch this film yesterday, when it was shown on TV, but curiously I was waiting to see another film with a similar title made in 2017. Even so, I didn't give up my time: even though I didn't have much predilection for alien invasion films, the film is quite dynamic, has good action scenes and a good amount of high quality CGI, and so it is, at least, a piece of entertainment that we don't regret watching... once. Just once.

Let's start with the good stuff: the scenes take place in Moscow, the Russian megalopolis, long before we ostracized the country due to aggression against neighboring Ukraine, when Russians seemed to want to have more contact with Westerners. This was a real breath of fresh air because in sci-fi films we almost only see US cities. I also believe that filming in Russia was a strategic option for the production to be able to film at lower costs. In addition to the clever use of the filming locations (which include Red Square and the GUM Shopping Center), the film offers us a massive dose of high-quality CGI, which we see in greater glory when the aliens appear. But the whole film is a feast of CGI and visual effects. The sound effects are also very good, and the action and running scenes are fun enough to keep the film moving.

And unfortunately, good things end here. Everything else is so full of flaws and problems that make the film unworthy of a second chance. This is just my opinion, but I think we can all agree on one point: there are a lot of films about alien invasions, and it doesn't take much thinking to remember two or three that make this film a total joke.

The film is directed by Chris Gorak, but it seems like he was more fascinated with CGI and action than trying to direct. Thus, we have a very young cast who are left to their own devices and who interpret the characters according to what seems most appropriate to them. Emile Hirsch did an excellent work in “Into the Wild” just before this, but he had a solid character and was well directed. Here, he has none: the result is a tepid, vague, lifeless interpretation without any personality. His partner Max Minghella, who had just done “The Social Network”, was not a good choice for his character. He is one of those actors who is “always the bridesmaid and never the bride”, so to speak: his lack of presence and charisma put him far from the main roles, although he is an option for supporting cast. Joel Kinnaman is stupidly weak as the villain: he behaves like a high school bully, and his character is as thin as paper. Olivia Thirlby also does little for the film, with a character who merely looks sexy, and who we expect to see kissing one of the boys at some point. Worse luck was Rachael Taylor, who is irritating to the point that we say hallelujah when her character finally dies. And the Russian cast? I don't know any of the actors, but I even liked Veronika Vernadskaya a little. Unfortunately, the Russian cast seems to be there only for us to see the Russians as perpetual badasses, a ""Rambo nation"" on horseback with machine guns. Putin certainly enjoyed seeing this in a Western film.

As bad as the cast and their performance, the script copies moments and elements from several sci-fi films (“Cloverfield”, for example) to create a story where there is no logical sense or real threat. It's truly unfortunate that, with such good CGI and such well-chosen filming locations, the film is unable to cause a single shiver of tension in the audience. In addition to a rather weak story, there are several moments in which the film seems to be mocking our intelligence: Moscow is one of the most densely populated places in the world: it makes sense that, even after the city is devastated in the first attack, there are only five or six people wandering the streets? Seeing a commercial plane crashed in a shopping center is sensational, but where did its wings end up? And why is there no fire, debris or explosions resulting from the collision? The film ends with a nuclear submarine setting sail from the Moscow River. However, you don't need to be a Muscovite or even a Russian to see that this watercourse doesn't have the depth or width to maneuver such a big thing! To think that the public will believe this things is insulting.",2023-11-24T13:06:17.039Z,3.0,The Darkest Hour,2011

First of all, no, I have no knowledge of the TV series this film is based upon, and after watching Jeff Wadlow's adaptation, I'm definitely not watching anything related to this story. I always follow this principle: the two pillars of any movie are its story and characters. It doesn't matter if everything else is absolutely perfect. If the two central pieces fail to convince the audience, then the whole movie falls to the ground. Sometimes, there are some crumbles that remain intact. Very rarely, there's a big segment that has no scratches whatsoever, which can help the film to survive and, even more rarely, actually make it ""okay"".

Fantasy Island has two little crumbles named Portia Doubleday (Sloane) and Maggie Q (Gwen), who deliver good performances, especially the former who everyone knows from one of the best TV shows of all-time, Mr. Robot. Everything else is completely destroyed. The Grudge still has a couple of redeeming moments, but Fantasy Island is undoubtedly the worst movie of the year, so far. The before-mentioned two pillars are built with the most annoying, cliche characters, as well as a ridiculous narrative that ultimately brings the whole thing down.

The third act possesses some of the most nonsensical, irrational, and illogical plot twists I've ever witnessed. This is 2020's version of Serenity, also a movie with an absurd twist that only turns the film even worse than what it was. The big difference between the two plot twists is that Serenity's was predictable from the get-go. Fantasy Island's last twenty minutes are profoundly unexpected because no sane soul would have thought of such a baffling narrative decision.

The best way to describe the twist without spoiling a thing (and I won't) is through the editing. During the exposition-heavy revelation, the editing is so awkwardly choppy that it made me think it was all fake. I genuinely thought the plot twist was a false sequence. When I realized it wasn't, I simply laughed like a maniac because I couldn't believe someone thought this made logical sense. Usually, a plot twist carries some sort of build-up, even if it's literally a couple of minutes before the explicit revelation.

This one just happens. Without any preparation, a character just shows up on the screen and begins explaining everything. It simply doesn't make any logical sense. It generates so many incongruencies with the whole story that I lost count of the plot holes I was able to point out. The film starts with establishing a few rules, only for an hour later to ignore or change them completely. A particular character acts a certain way without any plausible reason as to why. If the screenplay wasn't messy and confusing enough, the characters are also horribly-written.

I never enjoy writing that an actor failed to do its job, but Ryan Hansen (JD Weaver) is the weak link of the cast, even if every single script is dreadful. Even the casting doesn't make sense: Michael Peña as a dramatic Mr. Roarke? A character supposed to be serious and mysterious? It's Michael Peña! I don't want to insinuate that he can only do comedy, but making him the villain (if I can call him that) is another addition to the list of questionable production decisions. Lucy Hale (Melanie) is fine as the protagonist, but it all comes down to the lazy, unimaginative scripts. Everything is so unbelievably messy that I don't even have any sort of technical remarks... Maybe that the beginning of the film and the actual concept look interesting. That's the only compliment I can think of: it wasn't a bad idea (different fantasies, different genres, it could have been a fun mix of styles).

Fantasy Island is undoubtedly the worst film of the year until now. Consider it 2020's version of last year's Serenity, but with a third act's plot twist that is so unexpected, everyone will have their jaws on the floor due to how nonsensical it is. The story wasn't close to being decent until the revelation, and it only turned into something a lot worse after it. Dozens of incongruencies and massive plot holes are generated due to the ridiculous attempt at a Shyamalan-like twist. If the absurd narrative decisions aren't enough, the horrible character scripts don't help the not-that-great acting, with the exception of Portia Doubleday and Maggie Q, the only good aspects of the whole movie. In the end, the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are a total failure, making everything else fall apart with no possible salvation.

539537,jackcarlin18,"> _**Review on Horror Focus_**

Blumhouse is a strange one to predict when it comes to pumping out quality horror films. Jason Blum cleverly orchestrates a plethora of films on a tight-string budget, allowing some breathing space in the (un)likely case that one of his films is a flop. Normally, this is not the case as Blumhouse is prone to releasing the odd PG-13 horror movie every now and again, and strapping that age restriction on any horror already racks in the doe.

This, however, has no accounting for taste, as fans like myself can often be left puzzled by the fodder that is pumped out of the Blumhouse canon a few times a year. With quite the eclectic resume of films under its belt, we were treated to the likes of Halloween, Get Out and debatably The Purge, and with the brilliant The Invisible Man coming out so recently, it's truly baffling how a film like Fantasy Island is also the product of the same company.

No production company or director is perfect, as we are often exposed to some atrocious pieces of work from our most-trusted filmmakers (with the exception of Jordan Peele duh!). Blumhouse is not to be excluded as it isn't uncommon for them to pump out at least one absolute stinker a year, films that could easily go down as some of the worst the genre has to offer. Blumhouse itself is largely successful overall, and very rarely releases an all-out disaster; but if you see that dreaded brand stapled onto the start of a film title ie. Blumhouse's Truth or Dare, and Blumhouse's Fantasy Island, know that what you're about to endure will be 100 minutes of mind-numbing torture.

Image result for fantasy island

Let's make one thing crystal clear, Fantasy Island is camp as tits. The problem here however is that it doesn't realise, which is ridiculous given its boistrous bravado. What we have is a half-baked, often muddled experience that is so oblivious to its own unique charm and goofiness that such comments end up becoming a serious negative. If Fantasy Island capitalised on its own brand of silly then this would be an entirely more enjoyable experience from that alone, but instead it takes itself far too seriously and often gets lost in its own waffle.

Some elements here are promising, with the overall plot being somewhat intriguing, but its the sheer execution and over-crammed production halts any above average element from being anything more than ill-conceived and inept. The biggest problem lies in the fact that it never knows what it is, nor understand what it's trying to be. It never fully lands on being a jumpy scare-centric horror, nor does it fully execute its trippy Midsommar-esque sci-fi rife that it tries so desperately to juggle.

Fantasy Island is first and foremost a generically dull experience, one that feels like three extremely underwhelming scripts stitches together like the knock-off Leatherface mask. The final product is actually quite puzzling, one that has a troubled time trying to establish its own identity which inevitably leaks out onto its viewer, resulting in a nonsensical, head-scratchingly hollow experience that is as dense as it is naff.

 VERDICT 
Word to the wise; like Truth or Dare, if Blumhouse attach their name onto the front of a film title like they're Clive Barker, save yourself time and avoid it. This is one getaway you definitely want to cancel",2020-04-13T16:34:30.088Z,3.0,Fantasy Island,2020

I had to watch this twice to make sure I followed what happened, I thought it was because I was really tired the first time, but nope, it made about as much sense the second time.

A lot of this is just the writing.  I don't know what is with writers and mysterious islands (I'm looking at you, ""Lost""), but it makes them crazy: just because ANYTHING could happen, doesn't mean it needs to.  The problem with ""Lost"" is that they were actively reacting to viewer reactions, trying extremely hard to produce episodes that didn't match predictions (allegedly keeping the audience guessing), but that just makes disjointed story lines that wildly diverge for no reason.  This movie is basically that happening all in one go.

The reason that the audience can draw lines is because a pattern is established by the written story, diverging breaks that pattern; it does not enhance it.

This movie keeps some movie mystery clues in there, but there is a LOT of wild diverges and acting within acting here that I can't elaborate on without spoiling it (it's the one ""great"" thing about this movie, so I won't).  There is a high quality way of writing that involves red herrings and proper misdirection, but this is not it.  The end result looks the same, until you review what happened and realize that the first was based off the information given and the second is based off of arbitrary writing decisions.

The mystery of the island itself interferes with the traditional mystery aspect as well.  Even in ghost mysteries there are rules to follow.  When there aren't any rules left, you can't predict and the story actually gets boring if not frustrating.

10016,CinemaSerf,"Frankly, this could have been set anywhere, but Mars in the late 22nd century is the venue for this slice of mediocre sci-fi horror. It all centres around a group of police officers who are detached to a remote mining colony to apprehend the wanted murderer ""Desolation Williams"" (the single-gear actor that is Ice Cube). Led by ""Ballard"" (Natasha Henstridge) these cops, and their target, soon discover that their location has been compromised and pretty soon they are under siege from an army of zombies with an unique (and quite well depicted) means of entering and controlling the human body. Odd to see Jason Statham with hair, but otherwise I found this to be a pretty unremarkable drama that I can't think John Carpenter would look back on particularly fondly. Henstridge is competent, but her part is so generic and the dialogue - especially with her and a lacklustre Pam Grier is banal. It looks OK, and the pace once we start picks up too, but the whole thing is really derivative and this attempt to mix the horror and sci-fi genres is too dependent on some, admittedly decent, make up effects before an ending that left me wondering if a sequel were to be in the offing.

It’s bland, lifeless, vanilla, and feels like what the Lifetime Channel in America would do to a remake of the Tobe Spielberg classic haunting film. I think the only reason Gil Kenan was hired for this movie was because the movie is based around a monster house and he depicted a monster so well in his last film that the job only seemed like a no brainer. The problem is Kenan forgets to produce likable characters and interesting scares during the process of producing an evil possessed house. - _Zevi Wolmark_",2015-06-25T10:05:47.941Z,,Poltergeist,2015

Unnecessary to compare this with the original and I tried, but impossible to avoid it since it's an official remake. Everything, from the house to frame by frame, all the scenes looked the same, except the cast and it's set in the present world with the daily life's modern gadgets. If you had not seen the 80s film, then there's a little chance you might like it. Though it was not a serious horror movie, or a scary movie to consider, still quite enjoyable like a dark comedy in parts. But I recommend the old one.

Really? Sam Rockwell? He did not fit in the role, just okay though. And the kids, did not impress me as like the original movie. The only upgrade in this new version was the technology, CRT monitors to LED kind of stuffs. I expected a major, at least a bit alteration in the story or the screenplay that sets in a different circumstances and the location. That could have been a lot better. Disappoints for those who loved the first version. However, that movie deserved to be remade, and I did not think it would end like this. Hoping for a better sequel, but I'm already feeling that would end in the hands of the second string cast and crew which could be a cheap horror-thrill.

243688,talisencrw,"I had huge reservations about watching this remake, which I felt was completely unnecessary. It wasn't as bad as I had anticipated, and that the bad reviews at the time gave me the impression I should fear or avoid watching it. The special effects were pretty good, and Sam Rockwell, Jared Harris and Jane Adams (how wonderful it was to see her again, after her exceptional work in 'Happiness'!) sold the film for me. I knew what to expect after liking, but not loving, director Gil Kenan's earlier animated 'Monster House', but I was intrigued how his energetic directing would transfer to live-action work.

I think they could have made it more suspenseful and scary, but I'm not really sure that was their intention. I think they were going for a family experience with some thrills, chills and laughs...such as the recent 'Ghostbusters' remake was going for. If that was the case, then in that regard it was quite successful. I'm looking forward to re-watching this eventually with my 13-year-old son, horror-film aficionado, Julian, who like me adored the original.

243688,Per Gunnar Jonsson,"The movie blurb is written by some 20th Century Fox representative. I would guess that the person in question has not even watched the original movie. “Legendary film makers”? What a load of bull! These people have not produced anything really worth watching and this movie certainly do not improve on that score. I mean, how dumb are these people from 20th Century Fox? I certainly hope the audience are not dumb enough to fall for this obvious lie. Judging from the, well deserved mediocre score on various review sites I guess they did not.

Anyway, as for the movie. It is a bleak (cheap) shadow of the original. It has absolutely zero of the charm that the original movie had and, most importantly, none of the characters had anything of the charisma that the original characters had. The father is a total dumbass and an irresponsible at that. The mother could by just any Hollywood style housewife.

When you finally think that something interesting would happen, that is when the ghost hunter enters the scene, it just falls flat again. He is just totally lacking in appeal. He is neither a bad ass nor is he mysterious or anything else that makes him worth watching.

There are just so much things wrong with the story as well. How can this guy afford and get a one for a house when he apparently do not seem to have a job? He even manages to go for another house in the end after his original one apparently got shredded. How bloody dumb is the script writer? In the original it was a new neighbourhood which explained the “troubles”. In this one it is not which means that the script writer obviously had zero understanding of the original plot which brings us back to the same question again. What the f…?

There are some half decent CGI scenes in this movie but the same can be said for a lot of things coming out of the movie industry nowadays (well with the exception of SyFy productions of course).

As a young boy, Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley) claims to have seen the fearsome Tooth Fairy kill his own mother. He also claims that having seen her, she wont stop until she also kills him. Years later, and still haunted by the experience of that night, Kyle must return to Darkness Falls to aid his childhood sweetheart, Caitlin Greene (Emma Caulfield) and her kid brother Michael, the latter of which who seems to be at risk from the Tooth Fairy this time around. Can Kyle confront his fears and end the 150 years of terror that has blighted Darkness Falls?

Pretty much despised by the discerning horror-phile, Darkness Falls, to me at least, is a creepy, interesting and totally enjoyable thriller/ghost picture worth reappraisals. From the excellent, and chilling opening credits (where we nicely have a back story to work from), to the final confrontation, Darkness Falls ticks most of the ghostly requisites that is asked of it. Scary demon (troubled children with night terrors should be explored more in cinema I feel), cannon fodder bullies, cannon fodder obnoxious coppers and a constant sense of unease and dread. All of which is provided in Jonathan Liebesman's (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"") film. It's with the sense of dread that I feel that this deserves a better reputation. Hand on my heart I know the film isn't a scary boo jump picture, something that is unforgivable to many genre supporters, but atmosphere goes a long way to creating a good thriller/ghost story picture. Darkness Falls has it in spades, and it's also a film that is a nice antidote to the blood beast torture sub-genre of film that seep out from the multi-plexes on a seemingly weekly basis.

Any expectation of an outright horror film should be quickly extinguished prior to a first time viewing, and if noise annoys and staccato editing bugs you? well stay away. Also don't line up if one demands great acting in a budget restricted piece such as this, since both Kley & Caulfield are only adequate at best. But give it a go if you understand that a preposterous plot, and preposterous set pieces are a pre-requisite for horror films of this type. I say that since I've seen many comments decrying Darkness Falls for the unbelievable elements - only to then search their other comments to find praise for even more ludicrously plotted pieces! Or give it a go knowing it's more about the creeping stalking menace side of horror, or that it's also an action thriller as well as an uneasy story. Maybe just maybe you will enjoy it for what it is? Otherwise I guess you will be looking forward to ""Hostel 22"" or another ""Jason Attacks The Eiffel Tower"" movie... 7/10",2019-10-18T02:26:33.150Z,7.0,Darkness Falls,2003
10727,Wuchak,"**_Atmospheric chiller starts with potential, but falls apart in the second half_**

In the town of Darkness Falls (patterned after Fall River, Massachusetts), a kid named Kyle sees the legendary tooth fairy specter and is forced to go to an orphanage after his mother mysteriously perishes. Twelve years later, Kyle (Chaney Kley) returns to the town where the specter is wreaking havoc and he's jailed under false presumptions. Emma Caulfield plays the girl he left behind and Lee Cormie her little brother who has also seen the malevolent ghost and is therefore getting ""treatment.""

""Darkness Falls"" (2003) is a haunting ghost flick that starts out very promising, but fails to take advantage of its resources and potential. The movie is enhanced by a quality apparition and an eerie vibe, similar to ""The Ring"" from the previous year, not to mention a strong and sympathetic protagonist played by Kley (who would pass away in his sleep four years later due to a breathing problem). Emily Browning is excellent as the 13 year-old girlfriend in the prologue, but Caulfield doesn't capture the character as an adult, although she's okay. Unfortunately she's literally the only prominent female in the movie, which is scandalous for a horror flick of this ilk.

The movie takes a bad turn around the midpoint when Kyle (Kley) makes it to the hospital just as the boy is about to undergo an experimental procedure, which is ultra-contrived, and the film never recovers. In fact, it goes off the rails and totally loses interest. Another negative is that too much of the story takes place indoors. The few outside sequences are effectively atmospheric, but the bulk of the movie takes place in hospitals, houses, a police station and lighthouse.

While the music is good during the end credits, they run for literally ten minutes, which is curious long for a horror flick that only runs 86 minutes. So, really, the story is only 76 minutes long. ""Darkness Falls"" might still be worth checking out for those who value the above positives, just don't expect anything good or great. Overall, it's okay at best, hampered by lousy elements that are stunningly amateurish (for one, glaring kinks needed worked out in the script).

The movie was shot in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales, Australia, with establishing shots in Maine.

In the San Francisco area, five girls in 6th Grade reject a boy’s polite offer to dance with one of them falsely accusing him of assaulting her. Thirteen years later, when they’re all about 25 years-old, the women start receiving macabre valentines before their gruesome deaths. Who’s killing them and why?

""Valentine"" (2001) was made by the director of “Urban Legend” (1998), which gives you an idea of what to expect. Like “Urban Legend” and the overrated “Scream” (1996), there’s a wink of parody, but it’s done better and is actually amusing, not to mention disappears by the second half. 

Unlike those flicks, “Valentine” wasn’t successful at the box office, but I like it better. Sure, it’s a standard slasher with the tropes thereof, but I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It’s similar in tone to “April Fool’s Day” (2008), just superior. 

The notable female cast includes: Marley Shelton (Kate), Jessica Capshaw (Dorothy), Katherine Heigl (Shelley), Jessica Cauffiel (Lily), Denise Richards (Paige) and Hedy Burress (Ruthie). On the other side of the gender spectrum there’s David Boreanaz (Adam), Fulvio Cecere (Detective Vaugn) and Daniel Cosgrove (Campbell).    

The rockin’ soundtrack is good, featuring acts popular at the turn-of-the-century, like Rob Zombie, Disturbed, Linkin Park, Deftones and so forth.

It starts off quite promising, with shades of Frankenstein (1931) offering hope that maybe this wont be a sequel reeking of cash cow formula. Unfortunately it proves to be a false dawn, evidence that the writers were out of ideas, it lacks scares or a narrative spark to ignite suspense sequences. Harris is once again superb, Pleasence good fun as usual as he hams for all he is worth, while an extended sequence in a barn keeps fans of the series happy.

Michael Myers survives his descent into a mind shaft from the previous movie and holds up with a hermit for a year before returning to his hometown in Illinois to attack his niece during Halloween and any trick-or-treaters who get in the way. As usual, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is on his trail.

“Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers” (1989) has the best sense of Halloween up to this point in the Michael Myers story arc with a considerable amount of the runtime involving the entertaining shenanigans of trick-or-treaters. While it’s not great like the previous entry it’s pretty much on par with the original 1978 movie and I actually prefer it even though it’s less classy/arty and more blunt. Remember the infamous closet scene in the original? This one has a similarly effective sequence revolving around a clothes chute and Jaimie Lloyd.

Ellie Cornell returns from the previous movie as Rachel and looks better, but it’s charismatic raven-haired Wendy Foxworth as Tina who’s the main protagonist (aside from Jaimie, that is) with blonde Tamara Glynn offering support as Samantha. There’s also a Fonzie wannabe and his bud.

This is the first movie in the series to throw in a little camp and comic booky-ness like the “Friday the 13th” franchise did with “Part III” (1982) and subsequent installments. The campiness has to do with the two goofy deputies and the comic booky-ness relates to the mysterious man-in-black and the corresponding twist at the end, which is supposed to segue into “Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995). Like “Friday the 13th Part III,” there’s a long sequence involving a similar-looking barn.

As with “Halloween 4,” the movie was shot in the greater Salt Lake City area, Utah.

Detroit falls dark and silent and people are disappearing into thin air. A tiny group of survivors ""exist""...

Well it went down like a lead balloon! Critics and horror fans alike can't find much to like about it. It's certainly a tricky film to have confidence in recommending to anyone, for it's a bit short on answers and scares, sort of? However, considering the budget there's some technical guile here, and if giving the makers some credit, there's possibly intelligence of thought in the writing as well. Religio observations, a sly incorporation of the Roanoke colony disappearance and an existential undercurrent.

Yet it's such a frustrating picture, especially if you are a fan of Anderson's best works, or even if you rock up expecting the scarer that the adverts and plot synopsis' suggested. Cast are by the numbers wasted due to being hamstrung by the plot's attempt at blending chills with deeper thought, rendering the characterisations as unfleshed, while the ending feels like a cheat of unfinished business.

Trust me, you won’t believe how realistic the CGI is. You’d swear the snakes were right there with the actors.

The characters are in no way infuriating. At no point do you ever root for the snakes to win and all the human characters to die in horrible ways. You feel genuinely upset when a character dies and don’t want to laugh or cheer at all.

This is a huge surprise that this holds up after 20+ years, which is great because there aren't enough giant snake movies out there.

This was a bit before modern technology, but that's offset by taking place on the Amazon River, far away from where technology would work anyways.

This was also back when Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube thought they were actors (and I honestly prefer them as actors), and I certainly don't think that they are the any of the bad parts of this movie.

Jon Voight was by far the most confusing, if not ""bad"" part of this movie.  I think he was doing an impression of a Spaniard, but maybe was supposed to be having a Portuguese accent as that's what they speak in Brazil, but it was never clear if he was supposed to be FROM there or not.  Even the character itself is oddly motivated, fighting to stay alive against people, but clearly has no self preservation when comes to catching the snake alive....so he can.....what...mate with it?

Owen Wilson, in typically form, plays the ""let's ruin this"" role and really is a catalyst for the movie spiraling out of control.

This is a ""Mr. Toad's Wild Ride"" of a movie, not good (even back then), but still lots of fun.  With the bad CG and odd, but impressive practical effects, it certainly was never the impending threat of an unstoppable beast that was the problem.",2020-09-08T22:29:39.479Z,6.0,Anaconda,1997

When I first saw the trailer for this version of the story, I thought it looked a lot like a hurried sequel to the contemporary silly release ""Wrong Turn."" Five youths on their way to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert pick up a young hitchhiker who commits suicide in the back of their van. Looking for help, and a little common sense, they stumble upon a weird family and their chainsaw wielding offspring. Much violence and such ensues.

While the first TCM was not perfect, I eventually learned to love the shaky camera, lousy sound, and cheap look. One reason that film worked for me was the fact that much of the horror took place in blinding daylight, the cast was hot and uncomfortable, and it showed. In this version, even with the original's director of photography, most of the shots are too calculated. The horrors in the dark are not all that horrifying. This might be the rantings of a jaded horror film fan, but I never got the same feeling of unease as I did in the first film. Much of the original's story has been changed as film makers tried to keep the audience guessing by not doing a shot by shot remake, like Gus Van Sant's ""Psycho."" The absolute lunacy of the first film's family was strange enough, here the members are more dimwitted than scary. This lessens the impact of Leatherface's scenes. You know he is the worst it can get, you don't have an equally sick family to fall back on. One disappointing scene involves the heroine Erin (Jessica Biel) running to a trailer and meeting two women who will obviously not help her. Instead of being a tense moment, where mind games involving drinking a seemingly harmless cup of tea could be played out, the women are there for nothing more than exposition, blaming Leatherface's penchant to kill on being teased when he was younger for a degenerative skin disease. The five victims all meld together, Nispel's direction is okay, but the cinematography is too nice for this type of horror film. The black and white scratchy scenes recall TV's ""Millennium"" or ""The Blair Witch Project."" If I would compare ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to anything, it would be the terrible sequels that came out after the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to that point. Just one was watchable, ""Leatherface,"" but with the exception of Part 2, they were all simply remakes of the original film.

334538,Frank Ochieng,"The struggles of a sisterly connection are put to the test in symbolic darkness during a massive, freakish power outage in director Patricia Rozema’s intimate, gripping and quietly thoughtful post-apocalyptic drama **Into the Forest**. Academy Award-nominees Ellen Page (“Juno”) and Rachel Evan Wood (“Thirteen”) are the cinematic siblings in Rozema’s (“Kit Kittredge: An American Girl”) meditative, tension-inducing tale about the futuristic flirtation with global panic and disillusionment when the world faces the possibility of a modern-day meltdown in technological dependency. In short, **Into the Forest** is a low-key character study touching upon not only the survival of the deteriorating societal elements but also the bond of sisterhood glued together by faith and fear under dour circumstances.

Rozema’s unassuming yet disciplined direction and thought-provoking script creates a low-toned “end-of-the-world” cynicism that psychologically works in her minimalist melodrama. Also, the film’s leads in Page and Evan Wood provide a heavy dose of believability as the periled sisters trapped in the unpredictable confines of the ominous and isolating Canadian woods out in the middle of nowhere as the worldwide woes of a collapsing powerless predicament threatens the global community. Rozema does an admirable job of establishing layers of disorientation on both a collectively worldly scale and smaller, personalized scale for its clingy siblings-in-distress. **Into the Forest** truly resonates when the audience is forced to realize the frightening footsteps of its sisterly protagonists facing the mental and emotional scrutiny of their jeopardized existences.

Convincingly atmospheric and contemplative, **Into the Forest** manages to be chilling without being over-exaggerated and cliched as one might anticipate in the routine doomsday dramas looking to exploit its nightmarish nuances. The film, as mentioned previously, is set in the near future where sisters Nell (Page) and Eva (Evan Wood) along with their father Robert (Callum Rennie) reside in an expansive house in the woods located in the Pacific Northwest. The narrative wastes no time setting the foundation for its percolating premise when the loss of electricity causes an obvious impact of the uncertainty--stranded out in the broad rustic boundaries without the immediate access to the daily and crucial amenities needed. Nell and Eva come to the realization that the power may not be restored at all. As a result, the starkness and disbelief elevates as the young women must confront the harsh realities as their supply of food and other necessities are diminishing day-by-day. Thus hopelessness, haplessness and helplessness start to rear its ugly head for the unsteadiness of Nell's and Eva's fragile sanity.

Rozema uses **Into the Forest** as an effective landscape for the self-examination of how civilization can easily unravel in a moment's notice. The commentary is not lost on the complacency, indifference and arrogance of mankind taking for granted the gift of planetary conveniences--whether naturally conceived or technologically enhanced. Perhaps **Forest** is not as deep-seeded in traumatic forethought as one might expect but it certainly feels uplifting, genuine and insightful in its message of human despair predicated on a colossal whim of chaos and destruction. **Forest** is unflinching and reflective and clearly shows an edginess and eloquence that is not easily associated with the typical fear-the-unknown fables that are cranked out of Hollywood with bored redundancy. Thankfully, talented performers such as Page and Evan Wood are able to convey that sense of vulnerability that triggers a realistic concern to comply with the film's haunting, creepy theme.

Canadian filmmaker Rozema is no stranger in presenting prickly and complex women in transition of a reactionary canvas of feminine growth and self-discovery. Previous Rozema-helmed film projects such as the aforementioned ""Kit Kittredge: An American Girl"" from 2008 and debuted feature ""I've Heard the Mermaids Singing"" (1987) demonstrate the similar traits that embodies the determined spirit and inner doubts and dilemmas of Forest's harried heroines searching for comfort in the eye of threatening madness. Hence, Page and Evan Wood aptly carries the skillful angst and anxieties on their burdensome shoulders in Rozema's resourceful character-driven showcase of a crumbling and catastrophic World Order.

Undoubtedly, **Into the Forest** marches into the wayward woods of darkness in what amounts to be a surreal, disastrous fairy tale tainted in psychological turmoil. Let's say that the likes of Little Red Riding Hood have nothing on the exposed turbulence of **Forest's** sisterly dystopian divas in Page's Nell and Evan Wood's Eva.

Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood carry most of this ""mysterious dystopia"" movie. I'm sure this story can be used as a parallel of what it is to be a woman in the modern world, but I see it as a survival story. The two aren't necessarily exclusive to another.

The ""last person on the planet"" trope is good, but even just the idea of living off-grid is daunting enough to the average person without it being the only option.

It's a sister story right alongside ""Frozen"" and ""Kill La Kill"" to me. The family togetherness is a good lesson woven into the story.

While I'd prefer zombies, they do a great job of showing the story, the character's emotions and how they're feeling about things at any time.

On the frustrating side of it: you get to see people make a lot of mistakes in surviving, which of course progresses the story bit by bit.",2020-10-03T17:10:50.386Z,8.0,The Forest I,2016

That being the case, this first _Leprechaun_ movie is actually not very jokey (at least, not when you consider the fact that the villain of the piece is a three-foot-tall Irishman with a penchant for skipping, rhyming and polishing shoes). The effects are hit and miss, the acting is not very good, and a lot of the movie is shot too dark to make out properly, but _Leprechaun_ really is an okay horror movie.

The setup is intriguing, with Leighton Meester delivering a solid performance that brings just enough edge to keep things mildly interesting. Unfortunately, the movie doesn’t take any risks and sticks too closely to the formula, making the plot feel predictable and the suspense more muted than it should be. The pacing doesn’t help either; the first half feels like it’s dragging, and if you’re not fully invested, you might find your attention wandering.

Visually, the movie looks polished, and the college setting feels realistic, but the story lacks depth. While it’s watchable, especially if you’re just looking for a casual late-night movie, it doesn’t do much to stand out in its genre. It’s not a bad movie, it’s just a forgettable one. If you’re up for something light and don’t mind a few thriller clichés, it might still be worth a shot.

His look is a little different, but in a realistic “I’m-a-serial-murdering-insane-homeless-giant” kind of a way.

Well the reboot is effectively killed as far as I am concerned. If there are to be made another movie in this franchise there has to be another reboot. This one is just ruined.

The first 20 minutes or so was not too bad. Then it just went to hell. Rob Zombie must have been high on drugs when he wrote this crud. A god chunk of it is just some drug-induced psychedelic mess.

Debora Meyers is just a foul-mouthed brat who is so dislikable that you almost hope that Michael will get her. Dr. Loomis have been turned into a despicable asshole. Michael himself is mostly just a big dirty man who slashes people up. 

Occasionally he shows some of the supernatural qualities he is supposed to have but most often not. And he grunts a lot, what the f…? The dialogue is non-existent if you remove the foul language. I am normally quite resistant towards foul language but not when the movie is filled with it just to cover up the lack of talent in the writer.

And I think I can give a good honest independent review on any type of Move, so obviously here with an 8 & 1 star reviews one of them is either 100% wrong and the other right or this move possibly falls somewhere in the middle at around a 5*.

I watched it for the 1st time last night, I like the original, it's not a great Movie but it's good and a decent sequel to the Original,  Rob Zombie's Halloween remake of the Original was fairly good, 10x better than his second one.

I have to agree 100% with Peter's review here, the star is a Loud, Foul Mouthed, and extremely irritating and ignorant Character, she is also a terrible actress in this Movie unless you just want her for her screaming in y our face.

I like all the actors from other shows and Movies he throws in, some are wasted others are fairly good in their spots.

I also rate it a 1 STAR, I'm not against Foul language in a Movie, but it should be used in the right spots and times, in this one, they just throw the F-Bombs out there like it's a normal thing and it's not, even when I worked in a Factory with mostly Men that drank some before during and after work, they did not use foul language that often.

I could have raised my rating higher if that was not the case and if she was nothing more than a screamer, let her act a little, I agree with Peter's question, was Rob High when he filmed this, LOL!,  the reviewer that rates it an 8 star is WAY OFF!, I'm sorry whomever you are, but the only thing you get right is, it is Rob's Darkest Movie yet, other than that, this MOVIE SUCKS!

24150,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**Paying to see this is a waste of time and money.**

I've seen the original franchise, but I confess that ""Halloween"" will never be a movie that I enjoy. It's simply not the style of horror I enjoy: ""slasher"" films are simply too ""campy"" and will probably scare only those whose fear is measured by the amount of fake blood used in the scene. However, Carpenter's films acquired, with some merit, the character of classics. None of the older sequels even deserve to be used as a benchmark. They are simply awful, and it was the Franciscan poverty of subsequent films that motivated Rob Zombie to take the franchise and start over from scratch. And if the first movie was bad, this one is worse.

The film wastes no time with introductions. Starting at the point where the predecessor ends, it immediately transports us to the action, with a lot of deaths of characters that we do not know, and with which we do not care. The film thus functions as a virtual meat mincer. The script is downright amateurish, and an excuse for a horror film based solely on gratuitous bloodshed.

The actors are pretty bad. Malcom McDowell, who is usually a very good actor if he is well directed, has one of the worst works of his career in this film: in addition to having almost no time to do anything, the little he does is terribly bad, and the character is very bad. and unhappy. Brad Dourif does what he can, but in all fairness, I can't rate his effort beyond merely satisfying. Even so, he is the best actor in the film. The rest of the cast is forgettable, or downright awful, and that includes the entirety of the female cast.

Technically, the film bets heavily on CGI and liters of fake blood. The director completely forgot that the audience tends to feel the film more if they really sympathize, or care, with some of the characters, and in particular with the protagonist. Instead, he offers us all the fake blood he could buy with his millionaire budget, and grotesque deaths. It's no more exciting or frightening than an expensive video game, but it must have brought in a nice bag of money for the main players...",2023-02-14T21:52:37.270Z,1.0,Halloween II,2009

Not that I blame those onscreen, as it's all poorly cobbled together.

632727,L.E.R.E,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022) is a film I was looking forward to for a while, although I wasn't sure why. I had been very disappointed in the last couple additions to the TCM franchise, so I knew it was very likely that it would not be any different with this one. I watched the film the day it came out, and received exactly what I expected, I didn't like it. I liked it more than I expected, yes, but still not enough. The acting was lacking, the premise was stupid, and it killed off the beloved legacy character in the most insulting way possible. The only redeeming aspects of the movie are the nice-looking cinematography and the amazing gore. However, I am looking forward to seeing the next one, and I have no idea why. 3.5/5.",2022-06-19T01:55:11.981Z,5.0,Texas Chainsaw Massacre,2022
632727,tmdb28039023,"The original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre actually predated the original Halloween by four years, but now it’s the former’s turn to follow in the footsteps of the latter, resulting in a case of the blind leading the blind. This new Texas Chainsaw Massacre takes its cues from the recent Halloween and Halloween Kills, going as far as dusting off the franchise’s original Final Girl – the character, that is; Marilyn Burns, the actress who played the first Sally Hardesty, died in 2014, and she certainly is in a better place now (i.e., not in this movie).

Generally speaking, though, the only thing that separates this from pretty much every slasher film ever made is that, instead of the usual Dead Teenager Movie, Massacre ‘22 may very well be the first-ever Dead Millennial Movie. Speaking of which the kills, which have the power to save even the most generic and derivative of horror sequels, are another disappointment; only the first one, involving a very creative use of the bone shard sticking out of a compound fracture, shows any ingenuity.

The best thing that can be said of this uninspired effort is that it’s short (shorter still considering that about 10 of its 81 minutes are devoted to the closing credits); then again, any movie is bound to be brief that lacks a proper conclusion – and I’m not referring to the fact that when Sally, who has been hunting Leatherface down “for more than 30, 40 years”, finally has him cornered, she apparently decides, all of a sudden, that after having waited multiple decades for this moment, she might as well wait a bit longer; after all, what’s another five more minutes between old friends? This is excruciatingly stupid, but if the movie ended there it wouldn't be any more unsatisfying than the actual ending.

And the worst that can be said of TCM ‘22 is that it has the gall to draw a parallel between the titular chainsaw massacre and a high school shooting (“Stonebrook High”, which sounds very uncomfortably like Stoneman Douglas High School), as if a dumb movie that deals in gratuitous violence and doesn’t even have the decency to provide a cathartic resolution could ever find a way to connect emotionally to the victims of a real-life massacre.

632727,tmdb76622195,"The reluctant ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" franchise gets yet another reboot/reimagining/sequel, but this time they go the Halloween/Kills/Ends route and bring back a surviving character from the original film.  Things don't work out as well here as they did for the ""Halloween"" series.

Four idealistic, or naive?, friends purchase a ghost town in Texas.  They plan on renovating the entire town, and turning it into a progressive haven where they can save the world.  Sisters Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and Lila (Elsie Fisher), and couple Dante (Jacob Latimore) and Ruth (Nell Hudson) have run-ins with local law enforcement and some town hangers-on, with the film makers casting aspersions immediately- the Gen Z/millenials are portrayed as wide-eyed and woke, while the Texans encountered are a bunch of drawling, gun-toting racists.  Lila was injured in a school shooting, and Melody hovers over her constantly.  The group hear the tale of Leatherface from the 1974 original film, and we learn that the final surviving girl from that film, Sally (Olwen Fouere, taking the role originated by the late Marilyn Burns), became a Texas Ranger and is currently waiting for the call that her archnemesis may still be found since the murders of her friends are officially listed as ""unsolved.""  The group arrives in the ghost town to wait for a busload of investors, and find that an old lady (Alice Krige) and her adopted son (Mark Burnham) are still living in an abandoned orphanage.  The ghost town is going to get renovated by one man, Richter (Moe Dunford), who doesn't take to the group.  Leatherface finally makes a questionable appearance, there's a lot of questions throughout, and the carnage begins.

The timeline for the TCM franchise is even more convoluted than the Halloween franchise.  The film is barely over eighty minutes long, so there isn't a lot of character development or legacy building, although I did see director Garcia paying tribute to some other famous slasher films here and there.  The script tries to inject something different into its story, addressing the influencer craze without going overboard with it.  Garcia's direction works with well with the film's editing, and this is a tightly shot flick, although Bulgaria makes a lousy substitute for the Lone Star state- I'm a fourth generation born Texan, and know my birth state pretty well.

The problem here is, of course, the script.  Characters not only make bad decisions, they make idiotic decisions that literally get themselves and others killed.  While some of them evolve and put up a fight against Leatherface, they also open themselves up to their own demise because if they didn't, the movie would be even shorter.  The gore and violence is over the top, and I was very surprised that it got an (R) rating.  The special effects are very well done, but also very convincing, to the point that this isn't a ""fun"" horror film.  ""Terrifier"" was also a gory slasher/horror film, but it had tension and suspense.  ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" has little tension, and viewers asking aloud ""why did they just do that?!"" instead.  One set-piece on a bus was probably set up as the be-all end-all of gruesome mass murder, but it becomes a nihilistic exercise in tedium.  In this day and age, it's sad that we've become so numb, this is considered entertainment to be ""enjoyed"" again and again, considering that the original film, aside from one of the greatest titles of all-time, wasn't as gory as you would expect.

I think it's okay to finally put this franchise to rest, it debuted on streaming because of some disastrous pre-release screenings so don't look for it on physical media anytime soon.  I didn't hate it as much as some viewers and critics did; I guess I'm old school, looking for the horror in my horror films.",2023-07-15T11:32:33.543Z,3.0,Texas Chainsaw Massacre,2022

The Unborn has a better cast than a typical horror flick with Gary Oldman and Idris Elba, along with solid performances from Odette Annable and Meagan Good. The quality of the cinematography, editing, and effects would suggest a bigger budget than it actually had. Scare after scare parades through the film. You can feel the influence of producer Michael Bay (Transformers, Bad Boys) in this film and David S. Goyer (Blade: Trinity), which I consider a positive, whereas others probably would not. Some reviews complain about The Unborn's poor character development, but this is a horror movie. Horror isn't a genre known for its well-developed characters. The Unborn is probably not as good as I rated it, but it has great jump scares, good production quality, and a solid cast.

_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._",2018-09-15T01:56:35.704Z,7.0,Friday the 13th: A New Beginning,1985
9731,Wuchak,"***Heavily criticized, but one of the most entertaining and re-watchable installments***

I find the ""Friday the 13th"" flicks appealing because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods; the presence of a lunatic killer just adds an air of danger and excitement. Although this fourth sequel in the series is maligned by many, it's the installment that turned me on to the long-running franchise. Say what you will but “A New Beginning” ( aka Part V), is one of the most entertaining and re-watchable segments.

Released in 1985, the story centers around a halfway house for troubled youths deep in the sticks (filmed in Camarillo, California). Tommy Jarvis, who is still traumatized by the events of the previous film, arrives at the home, now approximately 17 years-old. Murders slowly start mounting up leading to an action-packed climax. Since Jason clearly died in the previous film, who is the killer? Is it Tommy?

The first two films in the series were serious murder-mystery horror pictures. Part III added campy elements, which is the case with Part V. Although ""A New Beginning"" plays it semi-straight, it's filled with black humor (e.g. when the ambulance man kneels over a hacked-up body and makes a hilarious comment to the frightened youths standing nearby), not to mention the OTT goofy mother/son hillbillies. In fact, there are so many laugh-out-loud moments that it's almost a comedy. Which is not to say it's bad; like I said, Part V is one of the most entertaining segments. If the campy hillbillies turn you off just chalk 'em up to side entertainment.

The deep woods halfway house for people with emotional problems is an interesting set-up and caught my attention right away; it sets this installment apart from all the others. In addition, Tommy, played by John Shepherd, is an interesting character: He's understandably troubled and there's a mystique about him (is he a hero or a mad killer or maybe both?), not to mention he can kick some arse when he has to. Speaking of which, a critic complained about Tommy's fighting skills being unrealistic, but it makes sense that he would do something like learn martial arts over the past five years to occupy his time and cope with emotional trauma and loss. There's nothing unrealistic about it.

The film is also notable for featuring perhaps the best assortment of women in the series: three blondes, a brunette and a redhead, no less. The lead blonde, ""Pam,"" is played by Melanie Kinnaman, the protagonist of the story, who's so striking it's hard to take your eyes off her. What's interesting is that Melanie is one of the few comely females in the cast that is never shown nude or partially nude. She's fully clothed the entire picture (although she has a wet-shirt moment) proving that a woman doesn't have to flaunt her beauty cheaply to get attention or instill awe.

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read this paragraph if you haven't seen the film). Aside from being entertaining like most of the installments, it should be pointed out that Part V does something better than any other film in the series: It shows the long term negative EFFECT Jason (and his mother) can have on people. Jason isn't physically present but his lingering, haunting diabolic presence permeates the atmosphere. So much so that Jason de-creates in his own lunatic image with the killer and Tommy Jarvis donning the mask at the end. In fact, the ending leads one to the conclusion that either Tommy has gone psycho or that he is the new embodiment of Jason (although Part VI implies that it was a dream or Tommy's imagination and not reality). This isn't that outlandish of a theory given that ""Jason Goes to Hell"" (Part IX) explains that the demonic thing that possesses Jason has body-leaping powers. It may very well be concluded that Roy and, later, Tommy were possessed by the spirit of Jason in this manner. Adding support to this theory is the superhuman strength displayed by the killer throughout. For example, he literally smashes through a door, breaking it to pieces, he hurls an adult man up and through a window, he decapitates a guy with one swipe of a cleaver, etc. No ordinary human being could do these things, unless they were possessed by a malevolent force/entity. ***END SPOILER*** 

Some of the cussing is a bit overdone. I'm sure the filmmakers threw it in as a comical touch. It goes without saying that if you find overkill cussing offensive you might want to skip this one.

BOTTOM LINE: ""A New Beginning"" is just a fun and entertaining deep woods horror flick with numerous highlights noted above, including black humor and camp. It’s easily the most all-around kinetic movie in the series and one of the few that works as a mystery, like the original.

As to the criticisms regarding the absence of a certain character, again, the film does a good job of showing what can ultimately happen to those severely traumatized by Jason. Not to mention the fact that Jason IS present in spirit, literally. So, yes, it's a vital part of the series.

The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Camarillo, Beverly Hills & Los Angeles).

Ben Willis stands out as a compelling and underrated character, bringing a sense of realism to the story without delving into the supernatural realm. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. deliver captivating performances, drawing viewers in with their charisma and acting prowess.

The sequel, ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" takes the characters on a harrowing adventure to an island, adding another layer of suspense and terror to the franchise. While some may overlook this installment as a credible sequel, the addition of Brandy Norwood as Carla contributes to the film's appeal and intensity.

However, the franchise takes a misstep with ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer,"" introducing supernatural elements that detract from the grounded nature of the original films. This departure from reality diminishes the impact of the storyline and characters, leading to a disappointing third installment that lacks the involvement of the main cast.

“Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995) is also known as “Halloween 6,” but it’s actually only the fifth movie featuring Michael Myers seeing as how “Halloween 3: Season of the Witch” (1982) is totally disconnected from the Michael Myers story arc.

I’m a fan of “Halloween 4” (1988) and “Halloween 5” (1989), especially the former, as it was actually better than the original movie (1978) and is one of the finest examples of 80’s slashers. Naturally I was expecting a quality sequel but, wow, this installment lacked any sense of cinematic finesse whatsoever.

The entire opening act is a tortuous mess and the story didn't even start to get interesting until past the 50-minute mark. Unfortunately, it failed to build on what little interest it mustered, trading it in for conventional horror thrills at a hospital à la “Halloween 2” (1981). But the characters are too weakly developed to care about; it’s like the ‘writer’ had no concept of how to establish characters or even tell a compelling story. Meanwhile the sudden-shock scares that kept surfacing were eye-rolling hackneyed and anything but scary.

This installment was the equivalent of Conan the Barbarian picking up an expensive guitar and trying to play for a classy prog band like Opeth.

The movie runs 1 hour, 27 minutes and was shot in Salt Lake City, Utah.

This stinks, it really does, and this coming from a man who owns and loves many a cheese filled B/Z movie. Although I would in no way say that AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) was a good movie, I have a tiny soft spot and found it watchable at least, this hack job makes that film seem like the pinnacle of creature feature nirvana. 

A Predator ship encounters problems on board by way of a newly born predator/alien hybrid, it crash lands on Earth (America) and thus Requiem is born as face huggers go crazy, aliens run amok, predator fights back, and the cast of genre stereotypes kill or be killed, the end! All the makers have done here (apart from attempting to kill off the franchise it seems) is splice together various staples from the other films in the series. Be it the settings or confrontations, they have just upped the blood quota, the film has no substance what so ever. Characters so dense and unlikeable you root for the monsters by way of having no choice, dumb teens in angst, Rambo mom, ex-convict trying to do good, you name it and chances are you have seen it in other rubbish murder death kill movies. 

There is gore galore which I'm sure will appease the easily pleased, and in one particularly monstrous scene involving a pregnant woman, a sequence for the squeamish to chat on the playground about come Monday morning. But you honestly would be better off watching some cheap no budget slasher film from the 70s, because unlike the money backed hack directors here, they had an excuse back then.

Well, it manages to run rampage forcing the ship to crash-land in Colorado. A nicely wooded area where the two races can pick up their unfettered hostility with enthusiasm. An added bonus for our hungry visitors is a local community of humans ripe for the eating. Maybe 90% of this is either filmed in the dark, or in dark and dingy interiors and that does nothing for the menace of the film, nor does it make it enjoyable to watch. The human actors are pretty mediocre delivering a dialogue that was clearly of little importance when it came to the commissioning of this completely unnecessary and unrewarding sequel; indeed I found myself very much in the corner of whatsoever wanted to make a feast of these rather uninspiring, hormonal, teenagers who are delivering a pizza one minute, then wielding a pump-action shotgun whilst driving a tank the next. Sci-fi is, of course, meant to be far-fetched, but this is just a beastie too far and the ending just ridiculous (if, mercifully, quite, quite final!).

I wouldn't say any part of me utterly disliked watching <em>'Aliens vs Predator: Requiem'</em>, though it has to be said that it is not a good film at all - it's almost impressive how uninteresting it all is. Thankfully it is relatively short at round 90 minutes, any longer and I may have hated it.

The main negative I hold is the lighting, or lack thereof. It's such a visually dark movie, so much so that you can barely tell the two titanic creatures apart at most times. There's also a supposed-to-be cool reveal at the conclusion, yet you can barely see who they are revealing. Very odd choice.

The plot and its characters are extremely forgettable, it's just a standard monster(s) attacks small town flick - something we've all seen before. Think <em>'Eight Legged Freaks'</em>, but worse. As for those onscreen, John Ortiz is the standout, though only if I had to pick someone. The whole story with the Howard brothers is so mundane and poorly portrayed.

A Phoenix secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), embezzles $40,000 and rashly flees town, ending up at a remote motel in Fairvale, California, where she encounters the eccentric Mama’s boy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Mixed into this web is a private investigator (Martin Balsam), Marion’s sister (Vera Miles) and Marion’s secret beau (John Gavin).

Directed by Alfred Hitchcock based on Robert Bloch’s book, “Psycho” made a huge impact when it was released in 1960. It contains a plot development that was groundbreaking at the time shared by England’s “City of the Dead” (aka “Horror Hotel”), which went into production six weeks earlier than “Psycho” and was released in the UK at the same time, but not in America until 2 years later. While they’re both good, “Psycho” is way superior. It was followed by three sequels (1983, 1986 and 1990), the last being a semi-prequel, all starring Anthony Perkins as Norman with Vera Miles returning for the first one.

One thing I don’t like is that it was shot in B&W. Check out the sequels and the 1998 remake to observe the same settings in living color.

His ability to use those screeching strings, and the pace of his music does so much of the heavy lifting that gives this film a sense of accumulating menace that makes it still, after over 60 years, a masterful piece of cinema. Janet Leigh wants to make a go of things with her cash-strapped hunky boyfriend ""Sam"" (John Gavin) so when an unexpected opportunity arises at work that puts $40,000 in her lap, she skips town and takes refuge during a thunderstorm at the ""Bates"" motel where she encounters ""Norman"" (a very handsome looking Anthony Perkins). The rest you will just have to watch for yourself, but the story has just about everything you could want from a thriller: a fella with a bit of a ""mummy"" syndrome; some good old fashioned larceny; lust and though I didn't quite love the ending, it is a superbly dramatic piece of well considered and constructed cinema that cleverly builds on what is quite a simple story with a strong and convincing cast.

The story is a classic horror setup, the finding of a hitherto unknown pyramid and the evil that waits within.  
The claustrophobic corridors and crawl spaces really work with the close camera work to ramp up the tension.  
Horror often relies on protagonists making stupid decision, which is often infuriating.

I'm guessing he hoped the darkness, the shadowy torch-light style photography (think ""Blair Witch"" 1999), might help to create some menace. Wrong! It just comes across as cheap and cheerful but with no sign of Boris Karloff or Christopher Lee.

What could have been a decent film turns into a frustrating experience, with the acting being barely convincing (if at all) and the script making strange, illogical choices that drain the life out of the story.

The characters make bizarre decisions that don’t feel real, and their emotional reactions often come off as forced or inconsistent. Some scenes made me wonder if the actors themselves even understood what their characters were supposed to feel. It’s hard to stay invested when the performances lack any real depth or energy.

The cinematography doesn’t help either—it’s a mess. The perspective constantly shifts, and not in a way that adds tension or style. Instead, it feels like the filmmakers couldn’t decide what they wanted to show or how they wanted to tell the story. At times, I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to focus on, and that lack of direction made it hard to connect with anything happening on screen.

During Christmas Eve at a sorority house in New Hampshire, the students & housemother are harassed by a killer who likes to gouge out eyes. For some strange reason the mad slasher knows all the inner rooms and crawlspaces of the house (attic, basement, etc.).

“Black Christmas” (2006) is the first of two remakes of the original film from 1974 (the other being released in 2019 and is a remake-in-name-only). This version is more colorful and entertaining than the original, but also more twisted, highlighted by a superior cast of women, including Michelle Trachtenberg (Melissa), Lacey Chabert (Dana), Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Heather), Jessica Harmon (Megan), Leela Savasta (Clair) and Katie Cassidy (Kelli).

Written & directed by Glen Morgan, the film is inventive with its backstory and the way the killer haunts the innards of the house, spying & preying on the girls. This is genuinely compelling stuff. Unfortunately, the film's tone and ending were marred by the interference of studio exec Bob Weinstein, who wanted a more over-the-top horror flick with cartoonish embellishments. The preposterous ending in particular seems tacked-on and (almost) ruins the movie. Thankfully some versions of the film are closer to Morgan’s original vision, at least as far as the climax goes.

The movie runs about 1 hour, 30 minutes, with a couple other versions longer or shorter by 4-5 minutes (depending on which ending was used). The film was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the hospital scenes done at Riverview Hospital in nearby Coquitlam.

146301,Frank Ochieng,"There are certain film franchises that just cannot take a hint and go away. The idea of milking the stale novelty of the on-going queasy saga of repetitive horrifying hedonism is something that both the movie-makers and movie-goers are guilty of perpetrating that ultimately feeds into the chronic sequelitis of misbegotten movies refusing to surrender the spotlight. This is definitely indicative of the Paranormal Activity movie series that stretched its one-time legitimate creepy credibility into a tired and tacky frightfest that overstayed its welcome. Hence, the arrival of the latest extension in the veteran found footage phenom machine entitled Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension. Basically, audiences needed another Paranormal Activity installment much like a creaky skeleton needs its share of body fat. Thus, this so-called ""final entry"" makes its macabre mark in the mediocrity of mayhem.

After four previous Paranormal Activity fear-inducing flicks (with Paranormal Activity 4 being released three years ago this month in October), the fifth entry for Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension looks to grind out what is left to pick apart in this grainy and grating creeper. Unfortunately, The Ghost Dimension drags and drowns in its desperate and dull attempt to parlay the familiar foundation of sketchy scares and manufactured jitters as it tries to jump start the stark memories from the other predecessors. The problem is that the Paranormal Activity editions have not sustained itself adequately after the original blueprint. So there is nothing to really build in terms of varying degrees of suspense and shock when the last couple of sequels were thanklessly watered down.

One would not mind so much if Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension was a viable swan song that wrapped up its continued bump-in-the-night theme with something unique and invigorating as it looks to wave goodbye to its former reputation as a distinctive chiller thriller. Sadly, The Ghost Dimension feels clunky and goes through the motions while not missing a beat in presenting the same old hair-raising high jinks. This is business as usual and even the most ardent defender of the Paranormal Activity film experience deserves more than this stillborn haunted house boofest.

It is a shame that the original brilliance of Paranormal Activity has been lost in the shuffle following a series of continued creepy-minded chronicles that single-handily ruined such an innovative premise. The blueprint for PA started out promising as it delved into the haunting shenanigans of its found footage gimmick that appeared so refreshingly raw and arresting. Plus, the unseen terror and imagined goosebump goings-on solidified this scare tactic piece of cinema as the ""reel deal"" of shock cinema at the time. It looked as if the PA influence would revolutionize (or at least lend some innovative spark) the horror genre to a different degree of expectation.

The premise in The Ghost Dimension finds a family man Ryan Fleege (Chris J. Murray) and his loved ones in wife Emily and young daughter Leila (Brit Shaw and Ivy George) moving into a new house as they get situated in their exciting place. Soon, Ryan and his brother Mike (Dan Gill) come across something most unusual--a leftover box containing a camera and VHS tapes (NOTE: it is worth mentioning that the tapes detail the harried happenings that occurred in Paranormal Activity 3). Strangely, Ryan and Mike come to the realization that this most peculiar piece of equipment has a bizarre power in that it can record what they are doing and broadcast it to other sources for whom they are viewing thus creating a link to past and present goings-on. Furthermore, this weird camera has captured the roaming and ominous spirit in the household. The threatening revelation, of course, is that the spooky presence of this ghostly figurehead is drawn to little Leila. Naturally, the concern is an open and shut case: the family must obviously protect the child from the pesky apparition as they are determined to get to the bottom of the mysterious camera that has caused this sudden sense of domesticated dire. 

Other than serving as a mere bridge to connect the previous PA outings to pad the proceedings in this current edition, The Ghost Dimension has really nothing to offer in terms of developing its own path of peril. This ""retread of dread"" feels needlessly wasted and we never are invested totally in what appears to be another routine rousing romp fortified with basic stares and scares, predictable knee jerk reactions, silly-minded atmospheric special effects and the typical ""child gloom-doom possession"" tactic that has been overused countless times before. Sure, Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension promises to answer some of the lingering questions that were presented in this movie's so-called folklore and does indeed touch upon some key factors that PA fans were curious about previously. Still, the film's pay-off in the later part of the story feels concocted and unsatisfying. Indeed, The Ghost Dimension feels like some elaborate patch job as opposed to a solid scream-dream thriller hoping to tie all the pieces together in a film fright series that has inexplicably lasted over the last several years.  Simply, the ensuing PA chronicles has been overwrought with meager menacing indifference. 

Director Gregory Plotkin (whose credits include editing some of the PA flicks) helms this narrative with a run-of-the-mill flair that does not help an already pedestrian exposition short on its share of daring chills. Surprisingly, The Ghost Dimension has an impressive handful of screenwriters with decent track records of scripting serviceable psychological gems yet their collaboration seems ineffective and incomplete. Perhaps an appropriate case of too many cooks crowded in the kitchen of creativity? The one saving grace, thank goodness, is John Rutland's delicious cinematography that is vividly shot with imaginative urgency. As for the 3-D special effects that are scattered throughout The Ghost Dimension, they somewhat resonate but it is nothing that one would label compellingly expressive from a visual standpoint.   

If the Paranormal Activity legacy has a Ghost of a chance to preserve its movie-making memories, it should take its final curtain call with Dimension and allow any found footage of these churned out sequels to speak for itself in the haunted house genre it contributed to so convincingly in its heralded heyday.

146301,Ahmad,"One step forward and two steps back! “The Ghost Dimension” seeks to breathe new life into a tired brand, but its fresh take ultimately hurts the franchise more than it helps. The concept of “a special camera that can see spirits” may have seemed intriguing at first, but in practice, it runs counter to the entire premise of the “Paranormal Activity” franchise . After all, it’s far more unsettling to speculate about what a demon may look like than actually seeing one. Moreover, the horror element is diminished if the audience knows the demons’ next move; the film becomes little more than a collection of cheap scares tossed in for effect. The story is poorly written; the characters are among the franchise’s most inept yet, and they’ll make you scratch your head despite the performers’ best efforts. “The Ghost Dimension” presented some new lore, but ultimately failed to achieve anything substantial. In any case, as it is, it’s a disappointing sixth entry in a franchise that has been pushed through the Hollywood meat grinder to cash in on the first film’s success.

9306,Wuchak,"***Troubled production is semi-coherent with some entertainment***

Ever wonder where Col. Kurtz would've ended up had he survived the end of ""Apocalypse Now""? Well, now we know: He exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals — the horror, the horror.

This 1996 version of ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" was such a troubled production that articles, books and documentaries have been made about it, like the 2014 documentary ""Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau."" Stanley championed the project, wrote the screenplay and was set to direct, but was fired after a few days of filming due to conflicts with Val Kilmer, who wasn't in the best of moods due to being served divorce papers while on set. 

Actually that wasn’t the main reason Stanley was fired. He was fine for small indie productions, but he was out of his league with a blockbuster like this. Veteran filmmaker John Frankenheimer was brought in to save the production from being a complete disaster. He got the job done, but his tyrannical approach didn’t help matters. 

The production was so bad that Fairuza Balk (the cat-lady, Aissa) literally tried to escape the set, but was caught at the airport in the nick of time. Add to this Brando's well-known eccentricities, not helped by the recent suicide of his daughter, Cheyenne, and constant rewrites and you have a formula for a cinematic chaos!

In light of the horrible production and the ensuing bad press you would think this would be a lousy movie, but it's actually not THAT bad. I can see why some people don't like it because parts of the third act are pretty crazy and don't flow very well, but if you're a sucker for lost-on-an-island type yarns and appreciate the mood & insanity of films like ""Apocalypse Now"" and the original ""Planet of the Apes"" (""It's a madhouse, a MADHOUSE!"") you'll probably appreciate some of it. Don't get me wrong, it's nowhere near the caliber of either of those films, but comparisons are inevitable and there are entertaining bits.

The main problem is that the story isn't that compelling; the flow of the movie is off, which is mostly apparent in the mounting craziness of the final third, which tempts the viewer to tune out. 

Thankfully, there are some positives. The title sequence is kinetic and dazzling; the score by Gary Chang is varied and all-around phenomenal; the plot is intriguing; the humanimal make-up and actors are quite good with Daniel Rigney's 'Hyena-Swine' standing out (Rigney would be dead a mere year after the film's release); there’s some creative pizazz, like Marlon Brando's 35-minute stint where he’s as captivating as always, albeit a fat bastage; the inclusion of Dr. Moreau's ""Mini-Me"" is hilarious in hindsight of the Austin Powers trilogy; and there are flashes of nigh greatness, like Edward's revelatory talk with Aissa in the third act.

Marlon's Dr. Moreau is a variation of Kurtz, i.e. nutjob in the jungle, albeit twenty years later. For Brando fans it's enjoyable seeing him in his old age. This was one of his final films and it shows that he had his magnetic charm ’til the end.

Furthermore, there are some interesting themes: The humanimals who get to live in Dr. Moreau's abode are more human-like in appearance than the animals living in the smelly humanimal 'village' in the forest; the most human-like one, Aissa, he even refers to as his daughter. Wouldn't this lead to tensions between the factions? Moreover, while Moreau is a benevolent dictator he's still a dictator and dictators are rarely good. When Hyena-Swine usurps the crown he immediately becomes a malevolent dictator.

The original version runs 96 minutes and the DC 99 minutes. The film was shot in Cairns, Queensland, Australia.

9306,tmdb28039023,"Rumors about The Island of Dr. Moreau’s suckage have been greatly exaggerated. The real problem with this film isn't so much that it's bad, but that it's not nearly as good as it should be considering the actors involved; on the other hand, it is precisely these individuals (and none more than Marlon Brando) who barely manage to save, perhaps even in spite of themselves, this particular island from sinking to the bottom of the sea. 

Brando invariably was the best thing about his good films, and the only good thing about the bad ones — this one is no exception; indeed, his portrayal of the titular scientist is one of the ways this version is superior to that of 1977. For all its flaws, I would go so far as to say that this is the best possible film of The Island of Dr. Moreau.

Whether by design or accident, Brando turns the weirdness all the way up to 11 — at one point, for example, wearing a “caloric converter” into which Fairuza Balk pours chunks of ice —, which is exactly what the role requires: the good doctor can never be anything other than the maddest of mad scientists.

When David Thewlis asks him whether “has it ever occurred to you that you might have totally lost my mind? I mean, this is just satanic”, the implicit, tacit answer is no — of course such a thing has never occurred to him, because lunacy has so absolutely taken over him that sanity and insanity are now one and the same thing. Brando’s Moreau is essentially a Kurtz whom ""the horror"" is no longer capable of horrifying.

By the way, the issues Francis Ford Coppola faced while filming Apocalypse Now — recounted in the documentary Hearts of Darkness —, including how to get the most out of Brando, make Moreau '96’s vaunted troublesome shooting feel like a picnic in comparison. Coppola somehow managed to create one of the greatest films in history — but then he is Coppola one of the greatest director/screenwriters, something John Frankenheimer will never be accused.

All things considered, it's possible that Moreau '96 would have done much better with lesser-known and even less talented actors; this is a visual story, after all, and the key is to reflect on screen the images that H.G. Wells brought to the page. 

The most important thing here is the spectacle, and this is why Brando rises above the material: because he does not have or does not know the fear of making a spectacle of himself, equal to or even more grotesque than Dr. Moreau’s creations.",2022-09-13T06:35:18.624Z,3.0,The Island of Dr. Moreau,1996

10283,John Chard,"Friday the 13th VIII: Jason Takes a Boat.

Jason Vorhees is once again brought back to life and goes on a kill crazy spree aboard a boat bound for Manhattan.

As is the norm with the ""Friday 13th"" sequels, this one garners scorn and praise in equal measure, so you roll the dice and take your chance really. By now the makers were trying to come up with new ideas to keep the series afloat, here the gimmick is to take Vorhees out of his Camp Crystal Lake ""comfort"" zone, and pitch him on a boat - a boat which naturally is full of ripe high schoolers who are ripe for killing in variously gruesome ways. 

The presence of Manhattan in the title is not wholly accurate since three quarters of the pic is set on the said boat, with standard series rules applying, though Vorhees seems to have attained the dexterity of a paratrooper given that he remarkably appears in kill scenes where the time frame is impossible for him to do so. The sequences in Manhattan are fun, which only makes one lament that more time wasn't spent on this particular gimmick.

The acting is generally weak, while the effects work is standard fare - though the cinematography (Bryan England) is very impressive. So all told, it's another divisive ""Friday"" sequel, from breasts and butts, to blood and bone, and onto The Big Apple, part 8 you will either hate or think it's great. 6/10",2017-01-29T17:46:36.522Z,5.0,Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,1989

10283,Wuchak,"***Jason takes a cruise to the big city!***

Released in 1989, ""Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan"" is a nice change of pace as the series was suffering from banality at this point; the previous installment is a prime example (people complain about Part V but at least it had an interesting new story angle with Tommy Jarvis going to the halfway house in the woods seeking succor for his psychological trauma, etc.). Part VII tried something new with the Carrie-like protagonist, and that entry has a great finale, but it was hampered by a subpar, amateurish script. 

Part VIII changes things up by switching the normal location of Crystal Lake (and surrounding area) to a ship going to Manhattan with a group of high school kids and adults aboard. Of course, Jason also gets on the vessel and starts systematically wiping out the youths. A handful of them make it to Manhattan, but so does Jason! The different setting is what distinguishes Part VIII. 

The story is split into four parts: The prologue takes place on Crystal Lake and features Jason's resurrection, which is a great opening. The brief first act takes place down the river from Crystal Lake at a docking inlet where the youths & adults board the vessel. The long second act takes place on the ship and the final act involves the survivors on a lifeboat and their adventures in Manhattan pursued by Jason.

Winsome Jensen Daggett stands out as the heroine Rennie and places as one of my top 3 or 4 Friday girls. Peter Mark Richman is also notable as Rennie's peculiar uncle/guardian and Scott Reeves as Rennie's sort-of boyfriend. Sharlene Martin is a highlight as Tamara and the filmmakers show off her physique, but she's so devious that she's a turn-off despite her good looks. Kelly Hu is also on hand.

The main complaint I hear about this entry is that it's called ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" but only the final act takes place in the city. This criticism never made any sense to me as the film spends more than enough time in the big city, the final 37 minutes, not to mention an opening snippet. The fact that the entire second act occurs on the ship keeps the movie from being one-dimensional.

This installment reveals that a fairly large river flows from Crystal Lake to an inlet with access to the ocean. The yacht in the beginning drifts down the river to the bay where the ship is docked. This is how Jason inconspicuously reaches the inlet. If there’s any doubt about this (due to the mistaken claim that the docking inlet IS Crystal Lake), pay attention to what the crazy deckhand says later on. 

As far as locations go, Part VIII was shot in Vancouver & Britannia Beach, British Columbia; Los Angeles (the alley way & wharf scenes); and New York City.

BOTTOM LINE: Part VIII is a worthy entry in the series and is notable for trying something new by placing the main cast in a cruise ship environment and the big city, plus Jensen Daggett is a highlight as the female protagonist. It's actually better than Part III and VII. Interestingly, Jason's facial F/X (shown at the end) aren't as good as the previous two installments, but they're serviceable.  

The film runs 100 minutes.

11470,Wuchak,"***Like ""Alien"" but with Jason and a sense of humor***

Released in 2001, ""Jason X"" starts in the year 2010 where the government decides to finally stop Jason by putting him into frozen stasis. He and another person are revived in the year 2455 by a professor and his students who are on a field trip from Earth Two to Earth One. Jason is unleashed on their spaceship and havoc ensues.

This entry is like 1979's ""Alien"" except with Jason as the monster and a sense of humor. You'll also notice that it's a great departure for the series putting Jason in space in the future. Most Friday fans look down on 1993's ""Jason Goes to Hell"" and ""Jason X"" because the producers tried something new. It's obvious that they felt the series had become stale and formulaic with an incredible eight-installment run from 1980-1989. I felt ""Jason Goes to Hell"" had a refreshing concept (ripped off from 1987's ""The Hidden"") and a great intro & opening act, but the tone was distasteful and the flick eventually spiraled out of control with its cartoony quasi-horror gobbledygook; still, it featured a couple of the best women in the series (Agent Marcus and Deborah), which should be commended.

I heard negative comments about ""Jason X"" over the years, but the first half is sci-fi at its best with some amusing elements thrown in for good measure. It’s stunning how well the filmmakers handle the sci-fi aspects of the plot and F/X. The second half, unfortunately, becomes too cartoonish as Jason systematically annihilates most of the crew, particularly when he gets his new futuristic look, basically morphing into SuperJason (rolling my eyes).

As usual, this installment features an impressive assortment of women, but it's only Kinsa (Melody Johnson) that I find appealing, except for the cameo of the campfire teen #1 at the end, played by the stunning Mika Ward. They should have included her in the main cast.

To be expected in light of the spaceship plot, the film was shot mostly on sets (in Toronto) with a couple of outside sequences in Ontario.

The film runs 91 minutes.

292280,Frank Ochieng,"Well, there are a couple of things that one can praise **The Bye Bye Man** for in an attempt to give this incredibly unoriginal teen screen horror showcase some flimsy credit. For starters, **The Bye Bye Man** continues the tradition of being another unforgettable goosebump saga to become meager fodder in the cinematic dumping ground of the new year movie season in January where a majority of flaccid frightening farces go on to linger in obscurity. Secondly, one must admit that the film’s title is somewhat catchy-sounding (okay, most of you may dismiss it as “dumb”). Otherwise, waving off the dullness of **The Bye Bye Man** is the only satisfaction that warrants one’s indifference to this piece of faceless slasher sludge.

Interestingly, **The Bye Bye Man** is a collaborative effort by the husband-wife team of screenwriter Jonathan Penner and director Stacy Title. Title, a veteran of a few anemic scare tactic features that include 2007’s _Snoop Dogg’s Hood of Horror_ and 1999’s _Let the Devil Wear Black_, shows little imagination here as the direction is woefully stillborn and contributes to the cheaply-made quality of this breathless boofest. Penner, mostly known to American television audiences as a three-time contestant on the long-running reality TV series _Survivor_ (2000-present) as well as a one-time Academy Award nominee, delivers a spotty and mundane script that does not even begin to challenge his intentions on presenting a macabre presentation looking to tackle the meaty psychology of what makes the misguided motivations of man so intriguing. Basically, **The Bye Bye Man** is banal and has no true backbone on which to ride this amateurish thrill-ride to the formulaic gates of gore.

In confusing fashion, the film’s opening features a shotgun-wielding man mowing down random folks in cold blood. During his carnage he repeatedly warns his unsuspecting prey (or more so convincing himself as a personal reminder) to “Don’t think of it, don’t say it!”. This repetitive phrase is uttered over and over but it does not stop this mad man from committing his heinous crimes back in the late 1960’s in woodsy Wisconsin.

The story skips to modern-day Wisconsin where the setting involves some college kids rejecting their dorms for off-campus living in a decrepit house not far from their university. Sweethearts Elliott and Sasha (Douglas Smith and Cressida Bonas) and athletic buddy John (Lucien Laviscourt) take up residence in the deteriorating place and it does not take long before Elliott discovers the scribbling message “Don’t think it, don’t say it!” on wooden furniture not to mention the creepy cretin whose words he reads with curiosity–The Bye Bye Man. Conveniently, a fourth friend joins in the mix in goth chick Kim (Jenna Kennell) whose expertise in the occult helps bring about what amounts to be the strange haunting of the titular troublemaker outed courtesy of Kim’s impromptu seance.

Naturally, the inquisitive Elliott wants to research the backstory of The Bye Bye Man and ends up turning to a source that was terrorized by the crazed character–a journalist that luckily survived the confrontation with the murderous misfit in the 60’s. Also, the journalist provides the scoop for Elliott as he explains the eerie legend behind what drives The Bye Bye Man’s sadistic impulses. As long as one does not mention his name or think about him then the curse of his maniacal manner can be eradicated. In other words, refraining from having The Bye Bye Man’s name on your lips can allow you to survive another day but should you defy his wishes then you are toast. Plain and simple. Are you shaking in your boots yet, gang?

Sadly, **The Bye Bye Man** is nothing more than a convoluted creeper that does not have much execution behind its gimmicky, shadowy mask. This hackneyed horror dud wants to build some kind of off-kilter mythology and tries to give the ole college try in soul-searching the warped motivations for thirsty mass murdering mayhem. Unfortunately, this junk-minded jolt session is transparent in thrills while harboring the same old sketchy CGI special effects and tossing around disposable characterizations that we actually do not mind **The Bye Bye Man** terminating just to supply the unintentional chuckles. This lifeless nail-biter is as original as finding plasma bags at your local blood drive. Cinema spouses Title and Penner concoct a feeble frightfest that never resonates beyond the film’s idiotic need to reinforce the caustic catchphrase “Don’t think it, don’t say it!” as if this brings some sort of shady sheen to this dreadfully generic affair.

The mystery concerning The Bye Bye Man’s ominous slaughtering certainly does not match the mystery concerning why veteran Academy Award-winning actress Faye Duaway is on board as the widow of the killing name-phobic nemesis as her character cannot explain the troubling proceedings of her ex. Hey, if Dunaway can survive the campy cult classic _Mommie Dearest_ from many moons ago then she can certainly survive the wretched **The Bye Bye Man**. On second thought…perhaps not!

There's nothing major difference with this and the regular horror flicks, except the internal structure of the tale. For that alone, it is worth a watch. Because they have used it the better way, yet the familiarity gives out everything to its viewers. So sad that you could predict the entire film, despite their best effort to turn it around. The good news is, if you are not a horror film fan, you possibly would enjoy it. But those who love and watch horror films regularly would find it somewhat a waste of time. I was the first one, and I thought it was better than some of the recent big names from the same genre.

Yeah, looks a mix of plenty of films. It was somewhat like 'It Follows', but less complicated. Easy to follow the characters and the story. Though from the beginning itself, it was very intentional. A decent cast and the filmmaking. It could be scary for some viewers, but I found a little edgy and well paced narration. But sadly it did not miss any of the usual horror flick formula. One of the most overused, not just in this film, but any horror films is that those film character interviewing the one of the survivours from the past. So if you don't mind such common usage, it is an acceptable film.

10285,Wuchak,"***Great intro & first act, but kinda distasteful and convoluted with a cartoony last act***

Released in 1993, ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,"" aka Part IX, is the oddest entry in the series, along with the next one. But this isn't much of a surprise since three of the previous four installments were departures from the typical Friday formula -- Part V, VII (which features a Carrie-like character) and especially VIII (which switches the setting from Crystal Lake to a cruise ship and the big city).

The prologue shows Jason back at Crystal Lake. How'd he get back there after the events in Part VIII? The ending of that movie didn't show Jason completely destroyed, so we must assume that he made it out of the sewers of Manhattan and simply gravitated back to his familiar stomping grounds, which is only about 75 miles away. Anyway, the opening is excellent and highlighted by the most stunning female in the entire series, Julie Michaels as Agent Marcus (which is saying a lot in light of the series having the best line of women of ANY movie franchise).

Jason’s corpse winds up in the morgue in Youngstown, Ohio, and the film takes an interesting twist reminiscent of the 80's cult film ""The Hidden."" Other bizarre additions to the Jason Voohees mythos include a magic blade, a strange ""Jason-Finder General"" character and the disclosure of the only way the infernal monster can be killed and resurrected. I don't mind these revelations as the series was hackneyed after 8 films in 10 years from 1980-89, albeit still entertaining. Besides, there are enough typical Friday-isms to please fans of the series, for instance the entire camp sequence and the prologue, not to mention the return of an iconic character in the finale.

Some fans object to the main revelation on the grounds that Jason is supposedly a misunderstood man-child and this movie changes that. Actually the only films fitting this model are Parts II, XI and the 2009 remake. Parts I, V, VI, VII, and VIII were more in line with the idea of Jason as a force of darkness & evil, the curse on Crystal Lake or whatever. And Parts III and IV had him killing a pregnant girl, psychologically torturing the heroine, and attempting to kill a boy after slaying his mother, so he wasn't exactly Lenny from ""Of Mice and Men"" as these critics maintain. Face it, although Jason may have been an innocent deformed child at one time, the seed of evil (possibly a demonic spirit) entered into his heart at some point and he increasingly became a hideous hellish monster and you have to give this entry credit for trying to fill in the bones with corpse flesh, whether you accept these surprises or not.

Unfortunately, there’s a distasteful element to the proceedings, which is offset by the black humor a bit, and the final act goes so over-the-top with the action and horror shenanigans that the movie becomes cartoonish and laughable. A good example is the campy fight between the deputy and Steven. As such, ""Jason Goes to Hell"" is one of my least favorite in the series, along with Parts III and VII. Nevertheless, it’s entertaining enough and gets extra points for trying something fresh and interesting.

Besides the awe-inspiring Agent Marcus in the prologue, we get a couple of cute campers, Deborah and Alexis, with Deborah (Michelle Clunie) particularly shining. There's also Jessica, who turns out to be the main protagonist, her mom (the goddess Erin Gray from ""Buck Rogers"") and Vicki from the restaurant. Needless to say, great job on the female front, but they coulda done more with Jessica.

For those who care (I don't) this entry seriously ups the ante in the horrific gore factor.

As far as locations go, this installment goes back to Southern California in the tradition of Parts III, IV and V; specifically the Los Angeles area: West Hills and Thousand Oaks. 

BOTTOM LINE: ""Jason Goes to Hell"" gets props for its radical departure from the Friday formula, even while containing “Friday” staples: youths, babes, Crystal Lake, slayings and so on. But there’s a disagreeable air despite the amusement and the final act spins out of control with quasi-horror zaniness. Still, any movie that features Agent Marcus and Deborah can't be all bad.

The film runs 87 minutes (rated) and 90 minutes (unrated).

It's both refreshing and sad to see them try to re-invent Jason.  As a fan of ""Fallen"" I like the idea of the villain transferring from person to person, but they twist the concept a bit more than I would have wanted at points.

Adding a ""chosen one"" trope to this doesn't do much for me.  Having a nearly unkillable villain alone should be intriguing enough, adding extra rules to it doesn't feel good.

I'd like to see a Marvel style reboot where the government has to try to contain the heart, and they figure out the minimum safe distance, creating a facility around it with animals going nuts, and someone breaks in to find out what it is and is possessed.

I imagine for someone who doesn't care about sharks, this might actually be a little boring.  They're used really well for a horror mechanic, there is almost a Rob Zombie vibe to this one.

The weirdest part of ""sharks in a lake"" is how the sharks are surviving, or if we believe the movie discussion that it's a ""salt water lake"".  There are lakes of weirder stuff, so a lake of salt water is reasonable, but it is very clear when you are in salt water versus fresh water.

It is honestly the biggest problem with the movie: the rest makes a lot of sense so it doesn't play with your suspension of disbelief.  The story is well structured, and the actors mostly do a good job.

Overall, it's just not the best movie though.  I personally don't mind forces of nature as adversity / antagonists, I liked ""Crawl"", but it has to done with a good delivery.

It feels like there should be options to just stay out of the water, which is what makes ""sharks in the ocean"" scary, its harder to get away.

6933,Key-Si,"""One Missed Call"" is a remake of the Japanese version from 2003, was directed by Eric Valette and stars Shannyn Sossamon in the leading role. The plot was as simple back then as it is here and now. People receive a call from their own future self to their own cell containing the last few seconds of their deaths. 

The only problem with this remake is, that the film makers had no idea what they were doing and in my opinion the material of original director Takashi Miike was pretty much raped and left for dead. Not only that this remake doesn't have the creepy feeling of the original ""Chakushin Ari"", even the characters have been ""white washed"". We have seen this already with the US remake of ""The Ring"", with the differenece that in that remake a lot of respect was shown towards the original movie ""Ringu"". Not so in ""One Missed Call"". The significant ringtone was changed to a dull and relaxed one, taking completely away that sharp and chilling aura surrounding these calls. On top director Eric Valette completely missed the point of ""One Missed Call"" being a franchise such as the already mentioned ""The Ring"" and also ""The Grudge"". Of all these franchises solely ""The Grudge"" was able to stick to the basic idea behind the Asian vengeful spirit, probably because original director Takashi Shimizu also took on the US remake. Yes, there were mostly non Asian characters in it and that was fine for the spirits in form of Kayako and Toshio kept their Japanese origin, making the 3 US remakes still relatable to the origin ""Yu-On"" franchise. ""The Ring"" already failed to do so by replacing Sadako with Samara, but at least it was a really good movie with a great atmosphere. 

""One Missed Call"" was supposed to carry the tradition forth with Mimiko, but instead we got some random characters you don't even care about and the PG13 crime gives this remake its death blow. You loved the original especially for the extended bone breaking, limb twisting death scene in the film studio? Forget about that in this one. This here is made for children's eyes. Sure, the CGI ghost effects towards the end were somewhat charming, but it is just about as creepy as some effects presented in ""The Pirates Of The Carribean"" and such. The hugging scene of the mother with rotten flesh falling off her fouly body piece by piece? Not even included! The only correct similarity seems to be that in both films the little girl who later becomes the vengeful spirit died due to an Asthma attack ignored by the mother(s). But that's about it.  

This remake is shot nicely and also the leading actors Shannyn Sossamon and Edward Burns tried their best to carry the film, but when the film itself already lacks any form of vision and respect for its origin, it just ends up as being a pointless, soulless cash grab product with a few nice visuals. If your kids are 13 you can show this atrocity to them, but please... as soon as they are old enough, do them a favour and show them the real thing. To all the fans of the original: stay away from this one. It will only anger you and leave a very bad taste in your mouth... Or is that due to the red candy?

11531,Wuchak,"**_Entertaining horror flick about a haunting witch that's been dead for over two centuries_**

Released in 2000 and directed by Joe Berlinger, ""Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2"" begins amidst the hysteria of the found-footage of the first film. People from around the world curious about the Blair witch phenomenon overrun Burkittsville, Maryland, wherein an entrepreneurial dude named Jeff (Jeffrey Donovan) leads a 'Blair Witch Hunt' tour involving four clients, a Wiccan, a Goth girl and an academic couple. After camping at the ruins of the home of an executed murderous hermit (who was evidently possessed by the spirit of the witch in the 1940s) the group has a rude awakening when they can't remember what happened the night before. They go to Jeff's nearby pad—a curious factory-turned-house—to review the video tapes for answers and discover something horribly macabre.

Atmospherically, ""Book of Shadows"" is quite effective as a haunting ghost/witch flick and the writing is actually smart—the entire play on hysteria, delusion & perception is quite clever. The screenplay was written by director Berlinger, who's best known for the great ""Paradise Lost"" trilogy of documentaries about the ""West Memphis three,"" youthful outcasts accused of a hideous 1993 triple murder in Arkansas based on dubious evidence (and who were finally released in 2011). Anyway, ""Book of Shadows"" starts satirically and amusing, but gets increasing serious and sinister. The acting is good too, with Kim Director's powerhouse performance as the Goth girl standing out. Erica Leerhsen is also a highlight as the Wiccan babe with several alluring scenes, but they coulda done more with her.

The reason so many people call this flick ""the worst movie ever made"" (Why sure!) is obviously because it's a knee-jerk reaction to it being a sequel to the mega-popular ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999), which was an altogether different kind of movie, being a found-footage flick, not to mention the herd-mentality of an over-critical feeding-frenzy. Since I'm not a fan of found-footage films—seeing as how they're about as entertaining as watching home movies for an hour and a half—I find ""Book of Shadows"" far more interesting than the first film.

There's a secret message in the movie that you can discover in (***SPOILER ALERT***): the FIRE, the GRASS, the factory WINDOW, the GRAVESTONE and the RUG, which all-together spells: ""Seek me no further or..."". This combined with reversing Tristen's backward words in the last act reveal the secret of 'ESREVER': ""Seek me no further or... the children will again walk free,"" meaning: the Blair witch would loose the spirits of the murdered children to torment the invaders of her domain. (***END SPOILER***)

As for the complaints of there being no Book of Shadows, it's simply not true. The character Jeff is a movie enthusiast with ambitions of being a filmmaker and ""Book of Shadows"" is the name of one of the scripts he put together and intends to shoot. So it's not something totally out of nowhere that Artisan dubiously added to the title, as most people think. Yes, they added it, but it had relevance to the movie. Furthermore, the actual 'Book of Shadows' is a Wiccan spell book and is figuratively used in the movie in that the group obviously falls under the spell of the Blair Witch after entering her diabolical terrain.

The film features a creative score by Carter Burwell and a rockin' soundtrack with quality cuts by the likes of Marilyn Manson (""Disposable Teens""), Godhead (""The Reckoning"") and many more.

After Berlinger finished his version of the movie the studio complained that there weren't enough conventional horror elements and so additional scenes were shot & edited into the picture. What else is new? It has been thus throughout cinematic history. For me, the added scenes beef-up what might've otherwise been too low-key for a horror flick. True, this route was taken with the first film, but ""Book of Shadows"" is the antithesis of that movie, and it's the better for it IMHO.

""Book of Shadows"" is a dense horror flick and therefore worthy of repeat viewings for gems to mine. (One aid in helping to understand the picture is Jeff's statement at the camp: ""Film lies; video tells the truth""). Unfortunately, this is evidently too much for some dullards. Yes, it's a slow-build with meandering aspects, but the movie's laden with subtext and the climax is pretty horrific, even while it's somewhat predictable. You never see the witch, but her nefarious presence is palpable nevertheless and the ambiance fittingly oozes Gothic. As for the doofuses who argue that the pic has too little to do with the first one, nothing could be further from the truth. Lastly, Jeff's factory-turned-house is almost iconic; a great location for a ghostly horror flick.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Baltimore, Maryland.

Several college youths agree to be part of a reality TV show where they stay in the dilapidated Myers’ residence in Haddonfield, Illinois. Unbeknownst to them, Michael is still alive and has returned to his home town after stopping by the asylum to visit Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis). 

""Halloween Resurrection"" (2002) is the seventh installment of the Michael Myers saga (not counting the unrelated “Season of the Witch”) and is the final film in the series until the remakes. It gets a lot of hate because of what happens in the opening act and the inclusion of Busta Rhymes, but it’s serviceable and definitely superior to the lousy “Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers” (1995). It’s just kinda unimaginative and cartoonish with several bits being hackneyed or predictable by this point.  

The feminine department includes Daisy McCrackin (Donna), Katee Sackhoff (Jen), Bianca Kajlich (Sara), and Tyra Banks (Nora). The beautiful women wandering around a rundown domicile and dying one-by-one is reminiscent of “Death Tunnel” (2005) but without the amazing cinematic artistry (even though it cost $11.5 million MORE), not to mention “Death Tunnel” has better women.

""Halloween 4"" (1988) is easily the most entertaining of the original series, followed by ""Halloween 5"" (1989) and “H20” (1998).

The movie runs 1 hour, 34 minutes and was shot mostly in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area with the Hillcrest Academy sequence done at Silver Lake, Los Angeles.

10513,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**Miserably memorable.**

This is one of those movies that, without a doubt, is bad. More than just being bad, it is an object of study for any apprentice filmmaker, because almost everything that could go wrong actually went wrong.

The problems begin with Ed Wood's utterly incompetent direction. My cat is the best movie director. Inattentive, careless and incapable, Wood simply lets everyone else do their jobs at their own risk. Wood doesn't seem to be concerned with any question of continuity (days and nights seem to happen at random, props appear and disappear several times), he allows us to calmly see the filming material (cameras, microphones, light equipment, etc.) until the cardboard headstones in his cemetery fall, so obviously fake it's incredible they were used in a movie. And I'd rather not mention the flying saucers, which are obviously children's toys hanging from transparent threads, probably maneuvered by fishing rods!

The script is, of course, another problem, giving us one of the most fanciful and clearly false stories that science fiction has ever seen: unpleasantly mixing vampires, undead and aliens, we feel that we just need to find Tarzan, Donald Duck, two or three cowboys and a family from Minnesota on vacation, having a barbecue in the cemetery. The imagination is the limit! And the dialogue? The film is an unstoppable source of jokes and memorable phrases, the result of the childish and idiotic way in which everything was written.

The cast brings together a series of names well known to most of the public, not because they are good actors, but because they have played important and notable roles at certain moments. This is the case of Maila Nurmi, the eternal Vampira, who doesn't say a single word and does little more than stare at us and the other characters. Even without opening his mouth to utter a sound, this is undoubtedly one of the most iconic films of this actress, in one of the most remarkable “personas” of her career. The friendly Tor Johnson is also here, with his unmistakable look that made him a striking figure in the cheap horror movies of this era. Bela Lugosi had his last film appearance in this film. Invariably wrapped in his aristocratic vampire cape, which immortalized him and in which he would later be buried, he died during filming, having been very skillfully replaced by another man, who hides his face with the cape so that it is not so evident that they are two different people.",2022-09-19T22:26:31.536Z,1.0,Plan 9 from Outer Space,1957

I myself like a lot of cinematic offerings that require the brain to be left at the door. There's something very calming about being able to sit back and drive oneself into a movie with absolutely no worries about themes, agendas, politico posturing and etc. What shouldn't be tolerated is when film makers ask you to not only leave your brain at the door, but to also dribble with it and slam dunk it into the nearest garbage can.

Alexandre Aja's 2010 redux of Piranha was a whole bunch of fun, even away from the 3D, in 2D form it had a devilish glint in its eye, but this on the other hand is an embarrassment to all involved. Who doesn't love the female form? Whatever your sexual proclivities et al, you would have to be dead to not appreciate the splendour of Eve's offspring. But when it's your main selling point, when you are only trying to please a very small movie watching demographic, then you got problems.

John Gulager (director in the broadest context of the word) wants to craft a Porky's for this latest hairy palmed generation, whilst he even thinks a touch of Grindhouse might curry favour with the mall rats and skaters. Everything about this picture stinks, the acting, the hopeless attempts at suspense, badly timed jokes, poor stereotyping, laughable effects work, and on it goes. Standing up and saying it's meant to be tacky, corny and tongue in cheek just doesn't cut the mustard here, bad film making is just that, especially when it's done purely to make money.

Compared to even the 1995 version, this version definitely increased the amount of nudity and gore, or at least blood in this.

Since this is more of a comedy-horror, having a waterpark ""going wild"" be the setting for this particular creature actually works out quite a bit.

You'd think once the killing starts that the comedy might stop, it has laughs all the way through, and while they're not necessarily all ""classy"" jokes, this isn't really a ""classy"" movie.

I'm honestly surprised (but grateful) to see Danielle Panabaker in this one as she does a somewhat ""straight man"" role, she's carrying most of the actual emotion in this movie.  It's not a typical role for what I'm used to seeing her in, but she's does a great job as she's a quality actress.

David Koechner leads the humor (and he's good at it) of the movie with some solid help from the rest of the cast.  David Hasselhoff, Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames even make cameos.

That is literally it, though. It's a bad movie, no question. It even feels like a pale imitation of the previous flick, which is quite something given that 2010 release isn't even anything good itself. The humans in this are extremely dull, while the piranha barely registered to me whilst watching. At least the run time is short.

Danielle Panabaker is 'the best' cast member, aside from Rhames and Hasselhoff who steal the show with comparatively small roles. Adrian Martinez's character almost works, while I did like seeing Christopher Lloyd return. Interesting to see Matt Lintz, way before his role in <em>'The Walking Dead'</em>.

Also, and I know I'm taking the lore of these things too seriously by saying this, but weren't the piranha supposed to be massive in this one; based on the end of the first film. This second movie ends with a tease of walking piranha, which is just as lousy an idea as the flying piranha from <em>'Piranha II: The Spawning'</em>.

Of course, the script is extremely talky and lifeless--as if it had been 'exorcised' of all the wonder and shock that William Friedkin's vision of the battle of good vs. evil would entail. Yes, Sir Richard Burton was a great actor--yet when shoehorned with a crappy script and with his more irritating peccadillos left unrestrained, he can be such a chore and bore to watch. Though I have not seen the two more recent 'prequels' for the 'Exorcist' franchise, I can safely say that while 'Exorcist II' is not the worst horror movie ever made (that, by the way, never seemed its intention), it's certainly the worst of the original trilogy--and by a country mile.

11586,tmdb28039023,"One of the many things that make The Exorcist arguably the greatest horror films ever made – or simply one of the greatest films ever made, regardless of genre –, is that it has no use for the obligatory final shot suggesting that the evil will continue. On the contrary, it ends on a hopeful, optimistic note; a welcome relief following the ordeal we, characters and viewers alike, have just endured.

Exorcist II: The Heretic carries on as if that final shot had actually been there all along. It's not just that Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) must go back to dealing with Pazuzu four years after the fact – meaning that two good men died for nothing –; it's how this reencounter comes about.

Once we accept the possibility of demonic possession, everything else in The Exorcist is perfectly plausible. The Heretic, on the other hand, comes up with a ""synchronized hypnosis"" device that leads to such ludicrous dialogue as ""Your machine has proved that there's an ancient demon within her!""

That this line is delivered by a frantic Richard Burton – who could achieve greatness with the right material – doesn't do it any favors. All things considered, the only heresy on display here is what director John Boorman does to the source material (in fairness to writer William Goodhart, his script was apparently rewritten beyond recognition) – I did, however, really enjoy the metaphorical use of locusts, which can go from solitary and harmless grasshoppers to, well, Legion.",2022-08-25T16:55:54.280Z,2.0,Exorcist II: The Heretic,1977

791,Filipe Manuel Neto,"**I have nothing against remakes… but at least try to do them well!**

I've seen John Carpenter's film _The Fog_ a few years ago, but I remember it well and how pleasant it was to see it. The original film didn't shed a drop of fake blood, it wasn't the kind of extremely visual film we've grown used to in recent years, with blood spurting everywhere and chunks of flesh flying towards us. Carpenter made a clean film, without the jumps that made us fall out of our chairs, but tense, very tense and full of mystery. And ultimately, that's really what made the film work so well… and that's what this film lacks, precisely!

The remake maintains, in essence, the script of its predecessor: Antonio Bay is an American coastal city that is about to celebrate the centenary of its foundation when mysterious occurrences and macabre deaths begin to happen, always related to a strange-looking fog, quite dense and somewhat greenish. However, the discovery of an old diary, written by one of the city's founders, finally brings some clarifications: after all, the entire city was founded at the cost of dozens of innocently killed human lives, and now, a hundred years later, his souls are returning from the sea, desirous of revenge.

I confess that I expected more from this film. The truth is, if I didn't really know what happens in this movie (thanks to Carpenter's movie) I don't know if I would understand what's going on here. Terribly poorly written, the script fails to convey the whole story to us, and new audiences run the risk of not understanding everything. It's a messy story, with flaws and missing parts. On the other hand, the film lacks any kind of tension, suspense or functional mystery. It has some good things, it tries to involve more characters, to take the focus away from that isolated broadcaster at the lighthouse, but the truth is that I don't know if this was really a good idea, since the film was much less clear and understandable than its predecessor and none of the characters manages to engage us, or capture our sympathy and interest.

Directed by Rupert Wainwright, it was the last feature film of his career, and although John Carpenter lent his name to the film, he has publicly stated that he was not involved in the project. The cast has several names and actors, but none particularly sounding name, and none of the actors was able to shine or really give us a work worthy of being fully appreciated, in a positive way.

On a technical level, the film has a fairly regular cinematography and makes good use of all the filming locations used. The visual effects and CGI work quite well, and the fog is truly impressive and even beautiful. But the film's redeeming qualities end here. I would like, as a historian, to highlight in particular my repudiation and disgust for the way they recreated the boat scenes, where we see Blake and his traveling companions. As the event takes place at the end of the 19th century, it is inconceivable and unacceptable that the production decided to use clothing, props and even a ship style from the late 18th century, that is, from a period one hundred years prior to the one intended to be retracted. This is mocking with history, and a sign of utter negligence on the part of the producers and the technical team.",2022-07-06T04:04:17.607Z,1.0,The Fog,2005
485774,furious_iz,"It's almost like someone forgot to finish writing this film...

It starts off well enough, even if the basic premise is a little well worn.  Son with a bright future loses his father suddenly, so mother and son have to shift to the middle of nowhere to make ends meet and cope with their grief.  The house they shift into belongs to a family member who is trying to sell it, so on weekends it is staged as an open house.

Of course as soon as the open house viewings start, strange things start happening.  This is where the film starts falling apart.  The film-makers can't seem to decide between implying that the occurrences maybe supernatural or someone who came to the viewing but never left.  Which is fine to add a little mystery, but the mystery isn't engaging, there is no hook to it.  Slightly odd things happen for no real rhyme or reason.  You keep expecting there to be a nugget of information as to why they are being targeted, but you get nothing.

When the film finally decides to settle on the menacing slasher route and stick to it, the wheels completely fall off, and this film starts crashing hard.  The film spends 3/4 of its running time raising questions and answers none of them, but not in an ambiguous way, just in a sloppy writing way.  

There's no explanation, no reason why, no back-story, and the killer is constantly blurred, out of focus or in shadow so you never see what he looks like.  Those elements can work, classic films like Duel you never see the psycho truck driver, but at least he has motivation.  In Halloween you never know why Michael Myers goes on a rampage but you get a physical sense of what he looks like, even if you don't really get a good look at his face.  But combining no back-story stalking, with a complete lack of motivation and no decent look at the killer just doesn't work.  You don't care what is happening because there is no reason for it, and not much to look at while it happens.  The protagonists might as well be getting attacked by a shadow.  There is nothing scary or interesting about the killer, because the killer really is nothing apart from a pair of boots.

There is absolutely nothing under the surface with this film.  There is no metaphor, there is nothing to learn, no twist, no insight to grief, no character revelations.  Just retreaded clichés poorly packaged to give you a boring and pointless final product.

This movie had potential. It started off interesting and I thought it was going somewhere, but in the end it just angered me like no movie in recent memory has. I think the they had no idea where they were going with the story so it just seems like lots of unnecessary bits of plot were added in an attempt to make something ""stick"".

The acting is fine, and the characters constantly and blatantly saying things like ""Isn't it crazy how there could be a person hiding in your house right now?"" might get in your head some, but _The Open House_ is a far cry from any sort of actual success.

I'm a big fan of Joey King, but she wasn't really in a positive to save the movie.

The production value is obviously there, the effects are even good, and there are several intense moments that should set the atmosphere, but I just couldn't bring myself to care.

The writing has to be to blame.  It's 4-5 shallow, empty characters with just enough flavor to tell them apart, and I just can't care about them.

The movie focuses on the subtly of it all, the growing madness that Slender Man instills in his victims without properly building the tension or showing the characters slowly losing it, which would have given good actors the ability to save it.  Instead they use a lot of ""it happened offscreen"" or sudden cuts to show a lose of time, and we get a character suddenly looking confused instead of taking the audience on a journey with the character.

Maybe it's not the writing, and maybe the editor just didn't know what they were doing?  ""What are all these long dramatic series in here?  This is so boring!  *cut* Eh, they'll get the point.""

With all the options out there, I just don't think this is worth your time.  I could tell you to just watch the 3rd act, and you'd probably get as much out of this movie as you're going to get from the beginning.",2020-07-30T19:22:13.528Z,5.0,Slender Man I,2018

I find this film hard to judge for the simple fact that it was supposed to be R-rated and went through massive studio interference. The decision to remove all traces of blood, violence and make every kill off-screen might have been more understandable if it were a PG film. However, the film did spike my interest in Slender Man, and the soundtrack is pretty good. I think a younger audience might find this film more effective.",2025-10-23T13:28:03.049Z,6.0,Slender Man I,2018

Somehow, the shark knew that Michael Caine was flying the plane to the Bahamas and simply had to follow his idol. 

Either that or he simply wanted Caine dead in retaliation for _Beyond The Poseidon Adventure_.

This film is well made and the performances are pretty good but the whole thing is silly beyond repair. Was the shark psychic? Was Ellen Brody psychic? Was the log that Sean Brody was clinging onto whilst being eaten psychic? Who cares?

Perhaps the shark in the Bahamas was a different shark? Perhaps the Brody's had a shark for each day of the week? Perhaps the whole thing was a dream - surely the most logical explanation.  However, I do not want to bail out the film makers on this one.

I don't even think <em>'Jaws 3-D'</em> is as awful as most fellow reviewers think and that's the case again with <em>'Jaws: The Revenge'</em>. It's bad, but it's not *that* bad. It makes little sense, though to be fair it is from a franchise that is all about a huge human-killing shark; despite sharks, in fact, not actually being all that keen on our rotten flesh.

Michael Caine is somehow in this. Well, I say somehow... a trip to the Bahamas and a nice paycheck likely made it entirely logical from his view; as he reportedly <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws:_The_Revenge#:~:text=%22I%20have%20never%20seen%20it%20%5Bthe%20film%5D%2C%20but%20by%20all%20accounts%20it%20is%20terrible.%20However%2C%20I%20have%20seen%20the%20house%20that%20it%20built%2C%20and%20it%20is%20terrific!%22"" rel=""nofollow"">stated himself</a>.

580,CinemaSerf,"Michael Caine must have needed another new swimming pool, otherwise what could have possessed him to turn up for this terribly poor sequel. We all start off with ""Deputy Sean Brady"" (Mitchell Anderson) sent to clear up some seaborne blockage before the fishing boats return. Needless to say, he encounters the distant cousin of his late father's menacing pal and is soon little more than tooth pickings. This hastens the arrival of the pretty but extremely bland Lance Guest as older brother ""Michael"" and guess what, the shark seems to have him on his sonar, too. Despite the fairly charismatic efforts of Caine, this whole thing is just nonsense from start to finish, made worse by Lorraine Gary's serious over-acting. There are just no scares. Even the legendary music has been mucked about with to ensure all trace of menace has been removed as surely as if by the (largely mechanical) shark itself. This is also a creature that seems to fancy it is in a ""Tarzan"" film, judging by it's fearful roaring. Either that, or maybe it is fed up because it has too much Brady stuck in it's incisors? To be fair, there is some fine underwater photography and I've never seen a shark eat a plane before - even one made of wafer biscuits, but sadly though nowhere near as bad as ""Jaws 3"" (1983), this is a sad end to the franchise that ought never to have been made.",2022-04-13T19:23:36.560Z,4.0,Jaws: The Revenge,1987

They needed to slow things down enough for the audience to get a sense of the world they were in and the stakes and players involved. Blood Rayne isn't exactly Mortal Kombat, the IP isn't as widely known and the plot is a bit deeper.
